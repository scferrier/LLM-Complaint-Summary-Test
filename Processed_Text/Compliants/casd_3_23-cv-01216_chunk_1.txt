1 Court-appointed lead plaintiff Dipak Patel (“Lead Plaintiff”), individually and on
2 behalf of all others similarly situated, by and through his undersigned counsel, as for his
3 Amended Class Action Complaint against Defendants ImmunityBio, Inc.
4 (“ImmunityBio” or the “Company”), Richard Adcock, David C. Sachs, and Patrick
5 Soon-Shiong (collectively, with ImmunityBio, “Defendants”), alleges the following
6 based on personal knowledge as to Lead Plaintiff’s own acts and on information and
7 belief as to all other matters based upon the investigation conducted by Lead Plaintiff’s
8 counsel, which has included, among other things a review and analysis of regulatory
9 filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), securities
10 analyst research reports, press releases, media reports, and other publicly available
11 information issued by or about ImmunityBio, interviews with former employees of
12 ImmunityBio and/or its business partners, and consultations with experts. Lead Plaintiff
13 believes that substantial, additional evidentiary support will exist for the allegations set
14 forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery.
15 NATURE OF THE ACTION
16 1. This is a federal securities class action against ImmunityBio and certain of
17 its top officials for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
18 of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) & 78t(a), and SEC Rule
19 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, codified at 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, on behalf of a class
20 consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise
21 acquired ImmunityBio securities between March 10, 2021 and May 10, 2023, both dates
22 inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were damaged thereby (the “Class”).
23 2. ImmunityBio, as it now stands, was formed in connection with a merger
24 between two clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies controlled by Defendant Soon-
25 Shiong on March 9, 2021. The combined Company owned a broad portfolio of at least
26 17 product candidates at various stages of clinical development, including several in
27 late-stage clinical trials.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.462 Page 5
of 81
1 3. Throughout the Class Period, ImmunityBio’s “lead” product candidate was
2 a cell fusion protein for the treatment of bladder cancer known as Anktiva. By the start
3 of the Class Period, Anktiva yielded impressive results in one of its Phase 3 trials and
4 the Individual Defendants actively planned to file an application to seek marketing
5 approval from the FDA, the first for any product in its development pipeline. As such,
6 ImmunityBio did not generate any meaningful revenues from the commercial sale of
7 any other products, and did not expect to generate any meaningful revenue from the
8 commercial sale of any products unless Anktiva received marketing approval.
9 4. As seasoned biotech executives, the Individual Defendants were fully
10 aware that their plan for Anktiva meant that ImmunityBio would need to demonstrate in
11 its forthcoming application that the facility which produced Anktiva fully complied with
12 the FDA’s minimum standards for drug manufacturing known as current good
13 manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), and, later, submit to a mid-review inspection by a
14 team of FDA field specialists to observe the facility in use and verify its cGMP status.
15 5. The FDA’s cGMP requirements are especially important for drugs derived
16 from living materials, like Anktiva. Unlike chemically synthesized drugs, “biologics,”
17 as they are called, often have a complex structure and manufacturing such drugs at scale
18 requires a series of highly-technical steps, each of which must be carefully controlled to
19 ensure a consistent end product free from impurities. Even a small deviation from
20 protocol can have a devastating impact on the composition of the drug and, thus, its
21 safety. For this reason, the FDA is not authorized to approve an application for a new
22 biologic unless it is satisfied from all evidence that it receives, including the findings
23 from the facility inspection, that it is manufactured in accordance with cGMP.
24 6. In contrast to ImmunityBio’s other “home grown” product candidates that
25 are manufactured in house, Anktiva was acquired from another company that relied on a
26 third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) to produce the active
27 pharmaceutical ingredient in Anktiva, which ImmunityBio continued to use. However,
28 the Individual Defendants repeatedly assured investors that the Company’s
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.463 Page 6
of 81
1 manufacturing resources complied with cGMP and even represented that the CMO it
2 used to manufacture Anktiva had robust cGMP standards in place.
3 7. On or around May 23, 2022, the Company submitted a marketing
4 application for Anktiva to the FDA, and continued to represent that its manufacturing
5 resources, including the CMO that it used to make Anktiva, complied with cGMP.
6 Because new data from the Phase 3 study continued to show a durable treatment effect,
7 the market, including analysts that followed the Company, were led to believe that there
8 were no major impediments to approval—certainly no cGMP issues.
9 8. Unbeknownst to investors, the facility used by ImmunityBio’s CMO to
10 manufacture Anktiva was plagued by myriad cGMP issues throughout the Class Period.
11 In March and July 2021, the FDA issued a Form 483—an official document that
12 memorializes any serious departures from cGMP—to the site’s management following
13 on-site inspections. Even after that episode, issues continued at the most basic level.
14 The CMO was unable to release manufacturing batch records or close out investigations
15 into critical deviations from established protocols on schedule. It regularly failed to
16 conduct stability tests designed to show that the active ingredient produced there did not
17 undergo unacceptable deterioration over time while in storage. It ran out of “reference
18 material” used as the control against which batch samples were tested. And numerous
19 batches of Anktiva failed for a variety of reasons.
20 9. With the application for their inaugural product on the line, the Individual
21 Defendants were keenly aware of these recurring issues. Defendant Richard Adcock,
22 ImmunityBio’s Chief Executive Officer, and Leonard Sender, ImmunityBio’s Chief
23 Operating Officer, were meeting with AGC officials on a monthly or bi-monthly basis
24 throughout the Class Period to discuss AGC’s continued delays.
25 10. In November 2022, the FDA notified the CMO that it would conduct a two
26 week inspection with six inspectors, signaling that the inspection would be more
27 intensive than usual. After learning this, ImmunityBio leadership became very
28 concerned given the history of deficiencies at the plant and asked to hold a mock
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.464 Page 7
of 81
1 inspection. Adcock and Sender were intimately involved in all aspects of the mock
2 inspection, which revealed that the facility continued to suffer from rampant cGMP
3 lapses. Because the mock inspection was just weeks before the FDA’s visit, not nearly
4 all of the issues identified could be remediated in time.
5 11. The FDA inspection, which took place in February 2023, was catastrophic.
6 After the FDA observed numerous violations on the first day of the visit, Defendant
7 Soon-Shiong demanded real-time updates and executive-to-executive calls at the end of
8 each inspection day. Adcock flew overnight to the site to participate in the rest of the
9 inspection. Ultimately, the FDA issued a scathing 15-page Form 483 cataloging a litany
10 of cGMP failings that it both observed while the facility was in operation and that it
11 confirmed by reviewing historic records at the site. The violations were so severe that
12 the FDA ultimately classified the inspection as “Official Action Indicated,” meaning it
13 recommended administrative or enforcement action to remedy the violations.
14 12. The serious nature of the cGMP violations uncovered by the FDA in
15 connection with its pre-approval inspection and the threat that they posed to patients if
16 not rectified would have been apparent to anyone with experience in world of
17 biotechnology development. They would certainly be obvious to the Individual
18 Defendants, especially industry veteran Soon-Shiong who has a background in medicine
19 and stewarded numerous drugs through the FDA approval process. This Complaint
20 includes the interlocking analysis of a highly qualified expert in the field of FDA
21 compliance, who explains the serious gravity of the cGMP violations throughout the
22 Class Period and concludes that the findings by the FDA during its pre-approval
23 inspection would, at a minimum, result in a recommendation to withhold rather than
24 approve the pending application for Anktiva.
25 13. Investors, however, were kept in the dark. Shockingly, ImmunityBio
26 continued to represent that its manufacturing resources, including the CMO that it used
27 to make Anktiva, complied with cGMP, even after the FDA’s February 2023 inspection.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB

of 81
1 14. It was not until May 2023 that investors began to learn the true extent of
2 the manufacturing issues. On the morning of May 11, 2023, ImmunityBio announced
3 that the FDA rejected its application for Anktiva not because of its risk benefit profile or
4 concerns with the clinical studies but, rather, because of deficiencies arising from the
5 pre-approval inspection at its CMO. The stock crashed, shedding over 55% of its
6 market value in a single day.
7 15. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous
8 decline in the market value of ImmunityBio’s securities, Lead Plaintiff and other
9 members of the Class have suffered significant damages.
10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS
7 A. Relevant Background
8 1. ImmunityBio and Its Business
9 29. ImmunityBio purports to be a clinical-stage biotechnology company
10 focused on the development of immunotherapies to treat cancer and other infectious
11 diseases. Immunotherapies refer to a broad class of drugs that complement or stimulate
12 the body’s immune system to fight disease, like cancer, and have become increasingly
13 common in the field of oncology in recent years, particularly in combination with
14 standard cancer therapies. ImmunityBio’s lead product candidate is a compound known
15 as N-803 marketed under the trade name Anktiva.
16 30. As it currently exists, ImmunityBio was formed in connection with a
17 business combination between a separate entity by the name of ImmunityBio, Inc.
18 (“Legacy ImmunityBio”) and NantKwest, Inc. (“NantKwest”) in March 2021. At the
19 time of this business combination, both companies were majority owned by entities
20 controlled by Defendant Soon-Shiong and was, effectively, a merger between two of the
21 many businesses within his family of companies.
22 31. Defendant Soon-Shiong is a former surgeon, scientist, biotech mogul, and
23 media tycoon known for his ownership of the Los Angeles Times and his interest in the
24 Los Angeles Lakers. He achieved fantastic success approximately twenty years ago
25 inventing and bringing to market a novel cancer treatment known as Abraxane. In
26 1998, his start-up, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (“APP”), acquired Fujisawa
27 USA and used its ties to hospital buyer groups to generate revenues from Fujisawa’s
28 money-losing portfolio of injectable generic drugs, which, in turn, APP used to develop
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.469 Page 12
of 81
1 Abraxane. APP went public in 2001. In 2005, the FDA approved Abraxane for
2 metastatic breast cancer. Following a merger with American BioScience, Inc., Soon-
3 Shiong split the company into Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (“Abraxis BioScience”), which
4 focused on Abraxane and other proprietary products, and APP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
5 (“APP Pharmaceuticals”), which focused on the injectables business. In 2008, he sold
6 APP Pharmaceuticals to Fresenius SE for approximately $5.6 billion. In 2010, he sold
7 Abraxis BioScience to Celgene for approximately $3.6 billion. Subsequently, the FDA
8 approved Abraxane for the treatment of several other forms of cancer. By 2019,
9 Abraxane was generating over $1 billion in annual sales.
10 32. In 2011, Soon-Shiong was free to pursue his other interests and formed
11 NantWorks LLC (“NantWorks”), among other ventures, to do so. It now serves as a
12 holding company for a collection of healthcare, technology, and finance companies.
13 33. In November 2014, Soon-Shiong formed Legacy ImmunityBio as a
14 NantWorks subsidiary under the name NantBioCell, LLC to focus on next generation
15 cancer immunotherapies. It later changed its name to Legacy ImmunityBio in May
16 2019. For ease of reference, all predecessors to Legacy ImmunityBio will be referred to
17 herein as Legacy ImmunityBio.
18 34. Soon-Shiong’s interest in NantKwest began around the same time that he
19 formed Legacy ImmunityBio. In December 2014, a clinical-stage immunotherapy
20 company by the name ConKwest, Inc. (“ConKwest”) announced that Soon-Shiong
21 made a $48 million investment in its business. At the time, ConKwest was developing a
22 proprietary line of enhanced natural killer cells for off-the-shelf commercialization.
23 Soon-Shiong quietly assumed the title of Chief Medical Officer and CEO between
24 January and March 2015. He made another $71 million investment in June 2015. In
25 July 2015, ConKwest changed its name to NantKwest and commenced an IPO at a
26 market valuation of $2.6 billion. Upon completing the IPO, Soon-Shiong and/or entities
27 his affiliates owned over 60% of NantKwest.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.470 Page 13
of 81
1 35. Soon after NantKwest went public, Soon-Shiong began to court Altor
2 BioScience Corporation (“Altor”) after learning that it was developing several
3 compounds that act on cytokines which help regulate the immune system, including a
4 cytokine fusion protein known as ALT-803. Throughout early 2016, Soon-Shiong
5 worked closely with Altor to bring their products into a cancer research coalition he
6 created. In April 2016, he was named Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. By the
7 end of 2016, entities controlled by Soon-Shiong had acquired over 50% of the equity in
8 Altor.
9 36. At the time Soon-Shiong took majority control of Altor, ALT-803 was
10 being evaluated in several late-stage Phase 2 trials for various forms of cancer,
11 including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (“NMIBC”). In May 2017, ALT-803
12 received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in
13 combination with a standard cancer vaccine, baccilus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”), based
14 on the data generated in Phase 1 clinical trials. The FDA’s Fast Track program is
15 designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions,
16 like cancer, and fill unmet medical needs.
17 37. In or around July 2017, Legacy ImmunityBio acquired Altor, including its
18 lead cytokine-based therapeutic compound, ALT-803, and continued to develop it under
19 the name N-803. At the time, a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG had just
20 begun in BCG unresponsive patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC. In
21 December 2019, N-803 in combination with BCG received Breakthrough Therapy
22 designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in patients who were
23 unresponsive to BCG based on interim data indicating that the primary endpoint of the
24 Phase 2 trial was already met mid-study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed
25 to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious
26 conditions and preliminary clinical evidence shows a substantial improvement over
27 available therapy. By August 2020, N-803 was known internally as Anktiva.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.471 Page 14
of 81
1 38. Since its IPO in 2015, NantKwest experienced a number of setbacks and
2 had not materially progressed its proprietary line of natural killer cell therapies. With
3 Anktiva moving much faster through the clinical development and regulatory process,
4 Soon-Shiong decided to use NantKwest as the vehicle to take Legacy ImmunityBio and
5 its product portfolio public. On December 21, 2020, the two companies issued a joint
6 press release announcing that they agreed to merge in a stock-for-stock merger. That
7 same day, Legacy ImmunityBio announced that preliminary data from the Phase 3 trial
8 of Anktiva with BCG showed that the study already achieved its primary endpoint for
9 patients with in situ forms of NMIBC.
10 39. The Legacy ImmunityBio-NanktKwest merger closed on March 9, 2021.
11 In connection with the transaction, a subsidiary of NanktKwest merged with and into
12 Legacy ImmunityBio, and NanktKwest changed its name to ImmunityBio. It assumed
13 the assets of Legacy ImmunityBio, including Anktiva, and its publicly traded shares
14 continued to be listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol IBRX as of March 10, 2021.
15 Immediately following the closing of the transaction, Defendant Soon-Shiong or
16 affiliates controlled by him beneficially owned approximately 82% of the Company’s
17 outstanding common stock.
18 2. The FDA Approval Process
19 40. Before a new drug can be introduced into interstate commerce for
20 commercial purposes, it must be approved by the FDA. The FDA’s rules and
21 regulations distinguish between chemically-synthesized drugs, known as “small
22 molecule” drugs, and therapies derived from living material, known as “biologics.” In
23 contrast to small molecule drugs, the means used to request FDA approval for a
24 biologic, like Anktiva, is a biologic license application (“BLA”).
25 41. The contents of a BLA must conform to strict guidelines outlined in FDA
26 rules and associated guidance. See 21 C.F.R. §§ 601.2(a), 601.29. Generally speaking,
27 a BLA includes data and supporting materials collected in clinical trials, along with
28 other information needed for the FDA to determine that the product meets prescribed

1 standards for approval, including information on the manner in which the product is
2 manufactured. In practice, a new BLA is a voluminous compendium of materials, and
3 usually includes raw study data, historic records, written summaries, and academic
4 literature, among other things, organized using a specific format adopted by the FDA.
5 42. The section of the BLA that describes the manufacturing process and
6 integrity of the drug is known as the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”)
7 section of the BLA. Unlike small molecule drugs, biologics are structurally complex
8 materials that are not clearly defined or characterized. The process used to manufacture
9 these materials at scale involves an array of highly technical steps, each of which must
10 be carefully controlled to ensure a consistent final product free from impurities.
11 Accordingly, the CMC section contains extensive information on the overall process,
12 including, among other things, a full description of the manufacturing processes from
13 start to finish, in-process controls used at each step, analytical methods used to test the
14 product for release at various stages, and stability testing to show that the product
15 remains true to form at regular intervals following final release, along with supporting
16 documentation for each. See FDA, Guidance for Industry: For the Submission of
17 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for a Therapeutic Recombinant
18 DNA-Derived Product or a Monoclonal Antibody Product for In Vivo Use (1996).
19 43. The CMC section of the BLA not only describes the proposed process and
20 protocols for manufacturing at scale, but also must include data generated in connection
21 with previously-produced process performance qualification (“PPQ”) batches using the
22 stated manufacturing processes and equipment. See FDA, Guidance for Industry:
23 Process Validation: General Principles and Practices (2011). The purpose of such a
24 qualification study is to validate that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of
25 reproducing results within predetermined specifications at commercial scale. Id.
26 44. Importantly, the FDA is not authorized to approve a BLA unless it can
27 determine from the materials submitted that the manufacturing process complies with
28 cGMP. See 21 C.F.R. §§ 601.2(d), 601.4. cGMP refers to the collection of minimum

of 81
1 procedures and practices set forth in FDA regulations, codified primarily at 21 C.F.R.
2 §§ 210-11, that companies must follow to ensure that the manufacture, processing,
3 packaging and holding of drugs is well-controlled. The FDA has stated that these
4 standards and practices assure the “identity, strength, quality, and purity” of drugs and
5 prevent “contamination, mix-ups, deviations, failures, and errors.” Any drug
6 manufactured using systems that fail to comply with these well-known and long-
7 standing cGMP regulations are deemed “adulterated,” subjecting the party who is
8 responsible for the failure to adverse regulatory action. See 21 C.F.R. § 210.1(b).
9 45. Once submitted, the time for the FDA to act on the BLA is governed by
10 various rules. In the first instance, the FDA will decide within 60 days if the BLA is
11 sufficiently complete to “file” it for substantive review. See 21 C.F.R. § 314.101(a). If
12 the FDA decides to file a BLA, the deadline for the FDA to act on it is determined by
13 the goal dates set forth in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended
14 (“PDUFA”). The version of PDUFA in effect at the time of the Anktiva BLA (PDUFA
15 VI) directed the FDA to act on 90% of new BLA submissions within 10 months of the
16 60-day “filing” date, unless the BLA is designated as a “priority” submission which
17 truncates the timeline to 6 months from the 60-day “filing” date. Development
18 programs that receive Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations are ordinarily
19 eligible for, although not automatically entitled to, priority review under PDUFA.
20 46. As part of the review process, the FDA will also conduct a “pre-license
21 inspection” of each facility used to manufacture the drug at a prescheduled time during
22 the review period. See 21 C.F.R. § 601.20(d). The purpose of this inspection is to
23 ensure that the facilities comply with applicable regulations, including cGMP. Id. Any
24 cGMP failures identified during the inspection can prevent the issuance of a license for
25 the product. Id.
26 47. Pre-license inspections follow a standard protocol. See, e.g., FDA,
27 Compliance Program Manual (“CPM”) § 7356.002M (2021). Staff carry out their
28 responsibilities not only by observing the site in operation but also by reviewing

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.474 Page 17
of 81
1 appropriate records at the facility reflecting past activities. Id. Given the significance
2 of this visit, many manufacturers hold mock inspections, perform cGMP audits, or
3 otherwise shore up compliance gaps in advance of the FDA review period to minimize
4 the risk for any adverse observations.
5 48. After completing its review, the FDA will either approve the BLA or send
6 the sponsor a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL outlines any issues identified
7 by the FDA during the review that prevent approval of the BLA in its current form and,
8 where possible, recommend actions that a sponsor may take to remedy the issues or
9 otherwise position the application for approval. See 21 C.F.R. § 601.3(a).
10 49. Upon receipt of a CRL, the applicant may resubmit the BLA with
11 amendments to address the stated deficiencies or withdraw it. See 21 C.F.R. § 601.3(b).
12 B. Class Period Plans for Anktiva
13 1. ImmunityBio Actively Planned to File a BLA for Anktiva by No
Later Than the Start of the Class Period
As noted above, ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva in July 2017
upon completing its acquisition of Altor. At the time of that acquisition, Altor had
recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG in BCG unresponsive
patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC.
By early December 2020, ImmunityBio learned from interim data that the
Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG already achieved its primary endpoint for patients
with in situ forms of NMIBC with no treatment-related adverse events.
Thus, by no later than December 2020, ImmunityBio knew that it was
reasonably likely that the Company would file a BLA for Anktiva upon final completion
of the study. Indeed, in the release announcing the initial results on December 21, 2020,
Soon-Shiong stated “[w]e expect to file a Biologics License Application following a
meeting with the FDA in 2021,” likely a reference to a “pre-BLA” meeting during
which ImmunityBio can gain input from the FDA on the content and format of an
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.475 Page 18
of 81
1 anticipated BLA. See 21 C.F.R. § 312.47(b)(2). In fact, the release included the
2 following headline: “Biologics License Application anticipated in second half of 2021.”
3 53. This precipitated a flurry of activity in 2021. On or around August 11,
4 2021, ImmunityBio appointed Soon-Shiong to the newly-created position of Global
5 Scientific and Medical Officer. In this new role, Soon-Shiong assumed responsibility
6 for clinical development. On September 13, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release
7 disclosing that updated data from the Phase 3 study of Anktiva with BCG continued to
8 show favorable data with no treatment-related adverse events in the in situ cohort.
9 Then, at the end of November 2021, ImmunityBio submitted a briefing document to the
10 FDA with updated data from that study. Such briefing material must be submitted to
11 the FDA at least one month before a pre-BLA meeting. See 21 C.F.R. § 312.47(b)(2).
12 ImmunityBio subsequently had discussions with the FDA about its forthcoming BLA.
13 54. On December 17, 2021, NantCapital, LLC, a Soon-Shiong investment
14 vehicle, provided $300 million in financing to ImmunityBio. The release announcing
15 this stated that the financing came directly “from ImmunityBio’s founder . . . Dr. Patrick
16 Soon-Shiong.” In addition, the release stated that the Company “anticipates a BLA
17 filing . . . in Q1, 2022” and noted that recent financing would be used to “expand our
18 commercial operations in anticipation of our bladder cancer BLA filing in Q1, 2022.”
19 55. On May 23, 2022, ImmunityBio announced that it submitted a BLA to the
20 FDA for Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive
21 patients with the in situ form of NMIBC. The BLA included the results of previous
22 clinical studies in that population, including the recently completed Phase 3 study, as
23 well as at least three previously-completed PPQ runs for Anktiva at the facility where
24 Anktiva was made. ImmunityBio requested priority review of the BLA. The FDA
25 accepted the BLA for filing in late July 2022, and assigned it a target PDUFA date of
26 May 23, 2023. In other words, the FDA put the BLA on a standard 10 month review.

of 81
The Individual Defendants Were Well-Aware of the Critical Role That
1 cGMP Compliance Played in Securing BLA Approval
2 56. Like most anyone with a working knowledge of the FDA approval process,
3 much less seasoned biotech executives, the Individual Defendants were well-aware of
4 the FDA’s cGMP regulations at all relevant times. On January 29, 2021, Defendants
5 Soon-Shiong and Adcock acknowledged in regulatory filings made with the SEC that
6 any manufacturing facility for products that it develops are subject to “all applicable
7 FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP,” and specified
8 that “cGMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance
9 of records and documentation.” The Individual Defendants, including Defendant Sachs,
10 continued to make the same, or substantially similar, statements in each annual report on
11 Form 10-K filed on behalf of ImmunityBio during the Class Period.
12 57. Throughout the Class Period, the Individual Defendants also knew
13 demonstrating compliance with cGMP was mission critical to securing approval from
14 the FDA for a new biologic product, like Anktiva. In the same regulatory filings
15 referenced above, the Individual Defendants admitted that “[t]he FDA will not approve
16 an application [BLA] unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities
17 comply with cGMP requirements.”
18 58. In this regard, the Individual Defendants were privy to the fact that the
19 FDA makes its cGMP assessment based not only on the manufacturing data that must
20 be included in a BLA but also on the results of an in-person inspection of the facility
21 while in use during the review period. In the same regulatory filings referenced above,
22 the Individual Defendants advised that a “BLA/NDA must include . . . detailed
23 information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed
24 labeling,” including “quality control documentation” generated by the facility that
25 manufactures the product and that “[m]anufacturing facilities must submit to pre-
26 approval inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit our marketing
27 applications, including our BLAs” to demonstrate that they are compliant with cGMP.
28 Indeed, they specified that the purpose of such inspections was to “assess compliance

of 81
1 with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to
2 preserve the product candidates’ continued safety, quality, purity and potency.”
3 C. ImmunityBio’s Reliance on CMOs to Manufacture Anktiva
4 59. At the time ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva from Altor, its
5 production was outsourced to a predecessor of AGC Biologics, Inc. (“AGC”), a third-
6 party CMO that provided manufacturing services for protein therapies which was
7 recently acquired by Asahi Glass Company. Indeed, just two months earlier, in April
8 2017, Altor entered into a manufacturing agreement with that CMO to manufacture
9 Anktiva for use in upcoming Phase 3 trials. At the time, Defendant Soon-Shiong was
10 Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. Following a corporate reorganization in
11 January 2018, that CMO was renamed AGC.
12 60. Upon acquiring Altor, ImmunityBio continued to rely on AGC to
13 manufacture Anktiva. As CW1 explained, AGC “originated” the technology for
14 producing the active ingredient in Anktiva and, thus, it would be exceedingly expensive
15 and risky to transfer that technology in-house, particularly with Phase 3 clinical trials
16 recently started. This was echoed by CW2, who observed it would be “extremely
17 difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to switch to another manufacturer at that
18 point.”
19 61. By the start of the Class Period in March 2021, AGC manufactured the
20 bulk drug substance for Anktiva. In contrast to a final drug product, which includes
21 both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials used for delivery,
22 appearance, or taste, e.g., tablet coating, saline solution, etc., drug substance refers
23 strictly to the active pharmaceutical ingredient. According to CW2, once released by
24 AGC quality personnel, drug substance for Anktiva was shipped by AGC in large
25 containers to be filled in vials in its final dosage form at another CMO elsewhere. This
26 was confirmed by CW3, who explained that drug substance made at AGC was sent to a
27 fill site operated by another CMO in California.

of 81
1 62. Notably, the building at these CMOs where Anktiva was produced were
2 “multi-product facilities,” meaning they were used not only to produce Anktiva but
3 other drugs as well. Indeed, during the Class Period, there were up to ten other active
4 pharmaceutical ingredients produced by AGC in the same building, and AGC’s internal
5 policies even allowed for the simultaneous production of two or more products in
6 certain production suites within the building. This configuration poses a heightened risk
7 for cross-contamination and creates other significant control challenges.
8 D. The Pervasive Undisclosed cGMP Failures at the Facility ImmunityBio
Used to Manufacture Anktiva Known to Defendants
AGC Was Inundated By Constant cGMP Failures Before the
10 FDA’s Pre-License Inspection
11 63. All facilities that manufacture drugs for the U.S. market must register with
12 the FDA, even if they are not the license holder, including CMOs. See 21 C.F.R. § 207.
13 In doing so, they become subject to routine cGMP surveillance inspections.
14 Historically, over 90-95% of drug manufacturers are found to be compliant with cGMP
15 upon inspection.
16 64. From March 11, 2021, to March 19, 2021, the FDA conducted a non-
17 routine inspection at the same AGC building where Anktiva was manufactured. The
18 inspection resulted in the issuance of a Form 483 by the FDA. A Form 483 is a
19 document issued at the conclusion of an inspection to memorialize significant
20 deficiencies observed during the inspection that, in the judgment of the inspectors,
21 constitute violations of FDA regulations, including cGMP. FDA investigators are
22 trained to ensure that each observation in a Form 483 is clear, specific, and significant.
23 The Form 483 is presented to, and discussed with, the company’s senior management at
24 the conclusion of an inspection. This procedure is designed to ensure that firm
25 management understands each observation and what they mean.
26 65. The Form 483 issued by the FDA in connection with the March 2021
27 inspection included a staggering sixteen item list of objectionable observations, replete
28 with numerous examples supporting each item. These included, most notably, failure
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.479 Page 22
of 81
1 on the part of AGC’s quality unit to adequately investigate deviations, inadequate
2 oversight of manufacturing procedures on the part of the quality unit, lack of adequate
3 documentation for quality control testing, poorly qualified and validated manufacturing
4 processes, and gaps in record keeping such that inspectors could not determine whether
5 manufacturing was operating in a state of control. Among other things, AGC
6 committed to implement a CAPA that required it to complete a data integrity risk
7 assessment for its computerized systems.
8 66. Just four months later, from July 12, 2021, to July 23, 2021, the FDA
9 conducted a routine cGMP inspection of the same building. This inspection resulted in
10 the issuance of a three-item Form 483. Among other things, the July 2021 inspection
11 found problems that would repeat themselves in the FDA’s February 2023 pre-license
12 inspection. For example, the firm either had deficient procedures or failed to follow
13 existing procedures for sanitation, cleaning, and maintenance. In addition, the FDA also
14 condemned AGC’s failure to document conclusions or follow up actions in response to
15 deviations.
16 67. Despite the FDA identifying these glaring quality lapses, this AGC facility
17 continued to suffer from myriad quality and control issues in the lead up to the Anktiva
18 BLA filing and the ensuing pre-license inspection by the FDA.
19 68. For example, AGC regularly failed to release batches, and thus delayed the
20 release of corresponding manufacturing batch records to ImmunityBio, on schedule. As
21 CW3 explained, batch records contain extensive detail about all parameters at the plant
22 at each step in the production process, as well as test results at certain stages of
23 production to ensure there are no deviations from the established production process.
24 As is standard, AGC was required to target final batch disposition within a set number
25 of days after completing its production process. But it routinely failed to do so. For
26 example, numerous batches of drug substance produced at AGC were not released until
27 well after the target disposition date by as much as three to four months. CW3
28 confirmed that AGC “frequently” missed batch disposition timelines between August
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB

of 81
1 2021 and February 2023. This is corroborated by CW2, who observed that
2 ImmunityBio had difficulty obtaining manufacturing batch records from AGC even
3 though they were needed for the Anktiva BLA. In particular, CW2 explained that
4 ImmunityBio did not receive the batch records for the PPQs needed for the Anktiva
5 BLA “for a long time” because AGC was “keeping” them long past the deadline.
6 69. There were also significant delays initiating and closing deviations
7 throughout the Class Period. A deviation is any departure from the written procedures
8 governing the manufacturing process. Adherence to the stated protocol is of paramount
9 importance for biologics. Due to their complex structure, even minor deviations from
10 normal manufacturing processes can result in significant changes in product
11 composition. cGMP requires manufacturers to document, investigate, and justify the
12 deviation for the batch to remain viable. See § 211.100. Prompt record management
13 ensures that immediate action can be taken in response to the root cause. AGC
14 maintained deviation management policies which required deviations to be opened
15 within a set number of days after detection and close out the investigation within a set
16 window of time as well. From 2021 through February 2023, AGC regularly failed to
17 initiate a deviation record and/or close out the investigation on schedule. For example,
18 several deviations during this time were opened a full year after the incident occurred,
19 and numerous deviations opened in 2021 still remained open as of February 2023.
20 70. Similarly, AGC closed critical deviations without implementing a
21 corrective and preventative action (“CAPA”). As the name suggests, maintaining a
22 CAPA is a critical component of a control environment because it can help prevent a
23 significant or recurring issue from arising again. cGMP requires all manufacturers to
24 establish written CAPA policies. See 21 C.F.R. § 820.100. AGC’s deviation
25 management policies required it to perform a root cause analysis and craft appropriate
26 CAPAs for any critical deviations. But in many instances throughout the Class Period,
27 AGC closed critical deviations without implementing a CAPA.

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.481 Page 24
of 81
1 71. Several CWs also reported that AGC regularly failed to conduct required
2 stability tests on Anktiva. A stability test is study performed on a batch sample at
3 periodic intervals after completing the production process to ensure that it does not
4 undergo unacceptable deterioration over time. Such studies are mandated by cGMP
5 because they ensure that product held for future commercial use remains pure and safe
6 to use when stored as planned. See 21 C.F.R. § 211.166. AGC was required to conduct
7 such stability testing at regular intervals, including upon completing the production
8 process, 3 months thereafter, 6 months thereafter, and 12 months thereafter. According
9 to CW1, AGC “regularly missed” required test windows since at least January 2021.
10 CW2 was also aware that AGC failed at times to conduct required stability tests prior to
11 the Anktiva BLA. For example, testing on a single lot of Anktiva produced at AGC
12 missed the 3 month window by 158 days, missed the 6 month window by 21 days, and
13 the 12 month window by 60 days.
14 72. CW1 also recalled that AGC ran out of “reference material” for Anktiva in
15 approximately April 2022. Reference material, also known as reference standard
16 material, is a specific drug batch of well-known composition and purity used as a
17 benchmark against which samples of unknown composition and purity are compared.
18 The lack of such reference material was a “major concern,” said CW1, given that it is
19 used to test drug substance for release during the final quality control review and for
20 stability tests thereafter. CW1 recounted that this lasted for “months.” This is
21 consistent with the account of CW2, who recalled that, in May 2022, AGC refused to
22 provide a “firm” date for when the next batch of Anktiva would be released to go to the
23 CMO who ran the fill site. CW2 explained that the delays became so extensive that
24 ImmunityBio was ultimately forced to pay a “postponement fee” to the fill site
25 amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
26 73. CW3, who headed the AGC facility where Anktiva was made, also
27 confirmed that there were “a number of batches that were not successful” at the facility,
28 meaning the entire batch was discarded because of critical deviations from the
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.482 Page 25
of 81
1 established manufacturing process, several of which involved Anktiva. In fact, CW3
2 advised that AGC performed six PPQ runs as part of its PPQ campaign because three
3 failed. CW3 explained that this was unusual because, typically, manufacturers present
4 three successful runs in a row to show that the process is repeatable, and usually only
5 involves one bad run. That there were “six attempts” to get three good runs raised
6 “questions,” and CW3 added “they were pretty messy.”
7 74. Plaintiff has retained Mr. Todd D. Clark, the current President of Value of
8 Insight Consulting, Inc. who has decades of experience in FDA compliance, among
9 other topics, and has frequently testified as an expert witness in pharmaceutical
10 litigation. Mr. Clark has a Master of Science in drug development and regulation from
11 John Hopkins University and a Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg
12 Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
13 75. In Mr. Clark’s opinion, the actions described above are not merely
14 technical or academic matters but, rather, represent serious substantive violations of
15 cGMP with the potential to directly affect the potency, purity, and composition of active
16 pharmaceutical ingredients of drugs, posing a threat to cancer patients whose health
17 status is already severely weakened. Mr. Clark further explains as follows:
18 AGC’s lack of effective batch and deviation management is indicative of a
manufacturing facility that is out of control. Significantly, the failure to
adhere to appropriate quality review timelines—one of the most basic
20 functions of the quality unit—was not limited to one or two isolated
incidents, but endemic during the relevant time period across different
functions. In addition, the importance of an established reference standard
22 to serve as the basis of comparison cannot be overstated. In the absence of
a reference standard, pharmaceutical manufacturers sometimes have to shut
down production, even to the point of withdrawing a drug from the market,
24 because it may not be possible to determine whether future batches possess
the appropriate characteristics. Stability testing is also critical, arguably
more so for biological than for chemical drugs given their increased
26 complexity and specialized storage needs. It is hard to understand why any
biopharmaceutical manufacturer would repeatedly fail to conduct required
stability tests within the specified timeframe, especially in advance of a
28 BLA submission.

1 76. Finally, Mr. Clark underscores that, from the sponsor’s perspective, even if
2 the cGMP problems were not present, the fact that multiple batches had to be discarded
3 at such a late stage in the development process indicates a poorly controlled (hence,
4 unreliable) process that was not ready for BLA submission, much less FDA approval.
5 2. The FDA Observed Numerous cGMP Violations During Its Pre-
License Inspection for Anktiva at AGC
On November 1, 2022, the FDA provided notice to Paul Tsang, Executive
Vice President of Global Quality for AGC that it would conduct a pre-license inspection
at the facility used to manufacture drug substance for Anktiva in February 2023 in
connection with the pending BLA for Anktiva.
A group of six cross-functional FDA specialists conducted the pre-license
inspection of the AGC facility that manufactured Anktiva from February 2, 2023 to
February 10, 2023. As provided in the FDA’s CGM, the pre-license inspection covered
the firm’s quality, production, materials, facilities and equipment, laboratory controls,
packaging and labelling systems. See FDA, CGM § 7356.002M. The inspection ended
with a “closeout” meeting on February 10, 2023, attended by FDA inspectors and AGC
senior management, including CW3; Wendy Laderach, Vice President, Corporate
Quality; Martin Shawala, Vice President, Quality; and Mike Barlow, Vice President,
Manufacturing.
At the close-out meeting on February 10, 2023, the FDA issued a scathing
five item, 15-page Form 483 to CW3 that detailed a litany of regulatory violations at the
site for each item. The objectionable conditions were organized into five categories
consistent with FDA standard practice but supported by extensive examples supporting
the observations.
Inspectors cited multiple instances of inadequate deviation management
from as far back as January 2021. At the very core of cGMP is the principle that
deviations be timely and reliably traced back to their root cause and, if identified,
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB

of 81
1 addressed with CAPA to avoid repeating the deviation. In its February 2023 inspection,
2 the FDA found overlapping violations of this principle again and again. For example:
3 • The FDA found that “significant” time passed between an event and its
classification as a deviation, citing several examples of a full year passing
between the time of the incident and the classification. Unsurprisingly, AGC’s
5 failure to create deviation records in a timely manner also prevented
appropriate resolutions from being implemented.
• AGC failed to conduct timely investigations, as demonstrated both by the fact
that less than 40% of all deviations since July 2021 were closed on schedule
8 and 80 investigations remained open at the time of the inspection, including
several that were open for two years. Among other things, AGC’s dilatory
approach caused market-ready batches to be left in limbo awaiting resolution
10 of open deviations for more than five months.
11 • The FDA also found that deviation investigations were closed without
documenting an appropriate conclusion or implementing any CAPA.
Inspectors found deficiencies in data integrity, missing validation for
computer systems, and lack of reliability of audit trails by, among other things, the fact
that computerized date and time settings were susceptible to improper changes. Among
the production components affected by the lack of proper data procedures were a
“critical sterilization process control.” Worst still, AGC had still not completed the data
integrity risk assessment that it committed to perform following the March 2021
inspection for “most of the computerized systems in use at the site.”
The site also failed in critical sanitation and contamination-management
practices. FDA inspectors cited an absence or lack of adherence to established cleaning
and sanitation programs to prevent introduction of microbial contaminants in controlled
environments and numerous potential cross-contamination hazards and cleaning
failures. A simple walk-through tour found violations in pest control in the warehouse
area, deficient filtration in a clean corridor, and a pool of standing liquid on the solution
prep room floor. The presence of clean and dirty components in the same room also
posed cross-contamination risks and the inspectors noted that AGC transported clean
and dirty components between buildings in the same vehicles for intra-site movement.

1 Notably, inadequate equipment-cleaning procedures had been identified in the March
2 2021 investigation. AGC revised its policies in response, but failed to conduct a study to
3 validate the revised process. AGC also created a CAPA to control the risk of
4 contamination by personnel, but failed for over two years to implement that program.
5 83. Inspectors found that AGC did not follow its own standard operating
6 procedures and written instructions. Most notably, the performance of stability tests
7 occurred outside planned test windows “by a significant number of days” including, in
8 one case, approximately five months. Other problems with standard procedures included
9 an operator’s nonadherence during a bulk-fill operation in a clean room environment as
10 well as inadequate procedures to ensure that materials were not kept at ambient
11 conditions in an uncontrolled or unacceptable manner.
12 84. Finally, and most critically of all, the FDA found, at a general level, that
13 AGC’s quality unit failed to adequately oversee manufacturing operations and, thus,
14 appropriately exercise its authority and responsibilities. In this regard, FDA inspectors
15 cited a lack of security to prevent unauthorized access to the site, inadequate cleanliness
16 and maintenance, failure to ensure that equipment used for testing was properly
17 qualified, the ad hoc use of a new reference standard different from the one set forth in
18 the BLA (with no assurance that the affected lots would not be released into commerce),
19 and extensive delays in reviewing batch records. As but one example of systemic
20 failure of the quality unit’s function, the FDA observed during the inspection a product
21 in cold storage with a printed product label and status tag which carried different lot
22 (i.e., batch) numbers. The FDA inspection team indicated that for “such a critical
23 deviation to occur, quality oversight failed at multiple steps in the process.”
24 85. During the closeout meeting, FDA personnel reviewed each observation
25 with senior management present from AGC, including each of those summarized above.
26 In response, AGC management told the FDA officials that they “understood” each
27 observation and had no other comments. One of the FDA inspectors expressed concern
28 that the GMP deficiencies found by the FDA inspection team indicate that the firm’s
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.486 Page 29
of 81
1 quality unit had not been effectively exercising its authority and/or responsibilities and,
2 of considerable importance for Anktiva’s FDA review cycle, noted that an independent
3 assessment of the firm’s quality management systems might be required to
4 systematically identify and address needed improvements in GMP practices.
5 86. Significantly, the pre-license inspection at AGC was classified by the FDA
6 as Official Action Indicated (“OAI”). Pursuant to its internal guidelines, the FDA will
7 assign one of three classifications to an inspection based on the severity of the
8 infractions observed (or lack thereof). No Action Indicated means there were no
9 objectionable conditions observed. Voluntary Action Indicated means objectionable
10 conditions were found but the FDA is not prepared to recommend administrative or
11 regulatory action. OAI is the most severe and means that regulatory and/or
12 administrative actions are recommended to remedy the objectionable conditions. As set
13 forth in the FDA’s internal CPM guidelines for pre-license inspections, an OAI
14 classification will issue if there is a finding that “one or more manufacturing systems is
15 out of control.” FDA, CPM § 7356.002M. Critically, the same guidelines that the FDA
16 used to conduct the pre-license inspection at AGC provide that an OAI classification
17 will result in a “withhold” recommendation on any pending BLA, which “ensures the
18 product cannot be marketed in the United States until a follow-up inspection verifies
19 implementation.” FDA CPM § 7346.832. In practice, this means that any pending
20 applications with the FDA will result in a CRL.
21 87. Given the serious nature of the underlying violations, OAI classifications
22 are exceedingly rare. During the FDA’s past ten full fiscal years before the pre-license
23 inspection, i.e., fiscal years 2012 to 2022, only nine percent of all inspections at drug
24 manufacturing facilities were classified as OAI.
25 88. Mr. Clark stresses that, wholly apart from the classification assigned to the
26 investigation by the FDA, the nature and extent of the violations cataloged by the FDA
27 inspection team are extremely serious. Mr. Clark explained that the departures from
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.487 Page 30
of 81
1 cGMP were so numerous and pervasive that they called into question whether the
2 quality unit was carrying out its basic functions.
3 89. In addition, Mr. Clark believes that the findings from the FDA inspection
4 would, at a minimum, lead to a recommendation to withhold rather than approve the
5 Anktiva BLA by the FDA. His assessment is based on the enormous number of
6 unresolved or behind-schedule batch dispositions and deviation investigations,
7 inadequate protections for computer systems and the facility itself, numerous
8 contamination risks, mismatched lot numbers, the possibility that inappropriate batches
9 might be introduced into commerce, multiple other cGMP violations, including several
10 “critical” violations, and a general lack of appropriate oversight by AGC’s quality unit.
11 90. Mr. Clark points out that, in the FDA’s view, a pattern of failure to conduct
12 investigations and resolve deviations is, on its own, sufficient cause for an OAI finding.
13 Other reasons for the FDA to issue an OAI finding that were present at the AGC site
14 include a reasonable potential for contamination, failure to qualify computers and other
15 equipment, absent or not-adhered-to standard operating procedures, and failure to
16 follow stability testing protocols.
17 91. At the end of the inspection, the FDA team raised the possibility that
18 AGC’s quality management systems could require an extensive independent assessment
19 to systematically identify and address needed improvements in cGMP practices. Mr.
20 Clark advised that, even if that could somehow be avoided, it would be unreasonable to
21 expect problems of this scale to be resolved to the FDA’s satisfaction (including another
22 inspection) within the few months remaining before Anktiva’s PDUFA date; meaning,
23 in other words, that a CRL was the only practical outcome.
24 3. The FDA Observed Several Objectionable Conditions At the
CMO That Filled Anktiva Into Vials
Making matters worse, the FDA also observed several objectionable
conditions at the CMO that ImmunityBio used to fill drug substance received from AGC
into vials in connection with its pre-license inspection of that facility.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.488 Page 31
of 81
1 93. From January 11, 2023 to January 16, 2023, three FDA specialists
2 conducted the pre-license inspect of the facility used by the CMO that operated the fill
3 site for Anktiva. At end of the inspection, the FDA issued a five item Form 483 to
4 facility management which detailed several objectionable conditions at the site,
5 including that (1) the site used equipment and conditions which were not properly
6 validated through qualification studies; and (2) there was inadequate equipment
7 maintenance. For example, a sensor used on a piece of equipment was due for service
8 in December 2020 but still in use at the time of the inspection.
9 MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS
10 94. Despite the steady stream of significant cGMP failings at AGC known by
11 ImmunityBio, Defendants made numerous false and misleading statements during the
12 Class Period about its manufacturing strategies and capabilities. Lead Plaintiff asserts
13 that all statements set forth below that are bolded and italicized are materially false and
14 misleading for the reasons set forth therein. Statements that are not bolded and
15 italicized are included for context.
16 95. The Class Period begins on March 10, 2021, when ImmunityBio securities
17 began publicly trading on the NASDAQ and the Company filed a current report on
18 Form 8-K with the SEC signed by Defendant Adcock (the “March 10, 2021 Form 8-
19 K”). Among other things, the March 10, 2021 Form 8-K disclosed that the Company
20 updated its previous disclosures regarding its business and risk factors as a result of the
21 Legacy ImmunityBio-NantKwest merger, copies of which were attached as Exhibits
22 99.2 and 99.3 thereto. Exhibit 99.2 to the March 10, 2021 Form 8-K touted that cGMP
23 manufacturing was one of its core competencies, stating in relevant part:
24 ImmunityBio, together with its merger with NantKwest, has now
progressed into a leading late-stage clinical company with a broad
immunotherapy clinical-stage pipeline of over 40 clinical trials in Phase I,
26 II and III development (company sponsored and investigator initiated)
across 19 indications in solid and liquid cancers and infectious diseases. . . .
The expansive clinical-stage pipeline and intellectual property portfolio
28 with 17 first in human antibody cytokine fusion proteins, chemo immuno-

of 81
modulators, vaccine vectors and cell therapies in clinical trials, including
25 in Phase II to III clinical trials, as well as a strong global intellectual
2 property portfolio of issued and pending worldwide patent applications
with patent life extending to 2035 and beyond, places ImmunityBio in a
leading position to transform immunotherapy care beyond current
4 standards of care. In addition, the company has adopted the strategy of
establishing GMP manufacturing capacity at scale and to date, the
company has cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise, ready-to-
6 scale facilities, with extensive and seasoned R&D, clinical trial, and
regulatory operations and development teams, which together will occupy
over 400,000 square feet of manufacturing and R&D facilities.
Exhibit 99.2 also represented that one of the key elements of its current
business strategy included investment in manufacturing capabilities for antibody
cytokine fusion proteins, such as Anktiva:
We seek to become the leading global immunological discovery and
therapeutics company by creating the next generation of immunotherapies
13 to address serious unmet needs within oncology and infectious diseases. To
achieve this goal, the key elements of our strategy include:
. . .
• Optimizing investment in our discovery, development and
manufacturing capabilities for our next generation targeted antibody
cytokine fusion proteins and vaccine candidates, as well as for cell
therapies including utilizing our just-in-time, decentralized advanced
cell therapy GMP-in-a-box manufacturing technologies.
Exhibit 99.3 to the March 10, 2021 Form 8-K outlined certain risks which
could adversely impact ImmunityBio’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, or prospects if they came to pass, including the following:
The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, and we may
23 encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process
development, quality control, or scaling-up of our manufacturing
capabilities. If we or our related parties, or any of our third-party
25 manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply
of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients,
if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to
27 maintain a commercially viable cost structure.
28 . . .

of 81
Currently we manufacture our product candidates or use CMOs.
. . .
In addition, the manufacturing process and facilities for any products that
we may develop are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority
4 approval processes, and we or our CMOs will need to meet all applicable
FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP, on
an ongoing basis. The cGMP requirements include quality control, quality
6 assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA
and other regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through facility
inspections. Manufacturing facilities must submit to pre-
8 approval inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit
our marketing applications, including our BLAs and NDAs, to the FDA.
Manufacturers are also subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory
10 authority inspections following marketing approval. Further, we and our
third-party CMOs must supply all necessary chemistry, manufacturing and
quality control documentation in support of a BLA or NDA on a timely
12 basis. There is no guarantee that we or our CMOs will be able to
successfully pass all aspects of a pre-approval inspection by the FDA or
other foreign regulatory authorities.
. . .
Our or our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities may be unable to comply with
our specifications, cGMP, and with other FDA, state, and foreign
regulatory requirements. Poor control of production processes can lead to
the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to
inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of product candidates that
may not be detectable in final product testing. If we or our CMOs are
unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the
FDA or other regulatory authorities, or in accordance with the strict
regulatory requirements, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we
need to commercialize such products.
The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as more fully described
above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture
Anktiva at a facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP
failings; (ii) the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed

2 a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active ingredient
3 in its “lead” product candidate, were not merely hypothetical.
4 99. On March 10, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release announcing that
5 the Company’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ following the completion
6 of the Legacy ImmunityBio-NantKwest merger, which represented as follows:
7 ImmunityBio is a leading producer of cryopreserved and clinical dose
forms of off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell therapies. The company has
established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell
9 manufacturing expertise, ready-to-scale facilities, extensive and seasoned

On April 30, 2021, ImmunityBio filed an automatic shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to place an unspecified number of debt and equity
securities on the “shelf,” which contained a prospectus relating thereto (as
supplemented, the “April 2021 Shelf Registration Statement”). The April 2021 Shelf
Registration Statement was signed by the Individual Defendants. On May 3, 2023,
ImmunityBio filed a prospectus supplement to the April 2021 Shelf Registration
Statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) (the “April 2021 Prospectus
Supplement”), to facilitate an open market, or “at-the-market,” sales agreement the
Company entered into with Jeffries LLC for up to a maximum aggregate amount of

2 Supplement, the April 2021 Shelf Registration Statement expressly incorporated by
3 reference the March 10, 2021 Form 8-K, including the materially false and misleading
4 statements set forth in ¶¶ 95-97.
5 102. In addition, the April 2021 Shelf Registration Statement expressly
6 incorporated certain information from the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A
7 that ImmunityBio previously filed with the SEC on February 2, 2021 (the “Merger
8 Proxy Statement”), including all information under the heading “Business of
9 ImmunityBio—Manufacturing.” In that section of the Merger Proxy Statement, the
10 Company boasted that the third-party it used to manufacture Anktiva had robust
11 manufacturing standards:
12 For our Anktiva product candidate, we have contracted with a multi-
national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities
in the United States, Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and
14 future commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process
development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity
production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors.
The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully
above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture

On May 14, 2021, ImmunityBio filed with the SEC a quarterly report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (the “1Q 2021 Form 10-Q”), which
was signed by Defendants Adcock and Sachs. The 1Q 2021 Form 10-Q outlined certain

6 the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed to continue.
7 112. On October 19, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release to announce the
8 results of the Phase 3 study of Anktiva in patients with the papillary form of bladder
9 cancer, which represented as follows:
10 The company’s platforms are based on the foundation of four separate
modalities: Antibody cytokine fusion proteins, synthetic
immunomodulators, second-generation human adenovirus (hAd5) and
12 yeast vaccine technologies, and state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf natural killer
cells, including autologous and allogenic cytokine-enhanced memory NK
cells. ImmunityBio is currently developing a dual construct COVID-19
14 vaccine candidate using its hAd5 platform. The company has established
GMP manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell
manufacturing expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive
16 and seasoned R&D, clinical trial, and regulatory operations and
development teams.
The statement identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraph above
were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts

3 The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, and we may
encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process
development, quality control, or scaling-up of our manufacturing
5 capabilities. If we or our related parties, or any of our third-party
manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide
adequate supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our
7 products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may
be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.
. . .
Currently we manufacture our product candidates or we may use third-
party CMOs or some of our related parties to manufacture our product
candidates.
. . .
In addition, the manufacturing process and facilities for any products that
we may develop are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority
14 approval processes, and we or our CMOs will need to meet all applicable
FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP, on
an ongoing basis. The cGMP requirements include quality control, quality
16 assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA
and other regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through facility
inspections. Manufacturing facilities must submit to pre-approval
18 inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit our
marketing applications, including our BLAs and NDAs, to the FDA.
Manufacturers are also subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory
20 authority inspections following marketing approval. Further, we and our
third-party CMOs must supply all necessary chemistry, manufacturing and
quality control documentation in support of a BLA or NDA on a timely
22 basis. Our or our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities may be unable to
comply with our specifications, cGMP, and with other FDA, state, and
foreign regulatory requirements, and there is no guarantee that we or our
24 CMOs will be able to successfully pass all aspects of a pre-approval
inspection by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities.
Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of
adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the
27 properties or stability of product candidates that may not be detectable in
final product testing. If microbial, viral, environmental or other

contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the
manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such
2 manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of
time to investigate and remedy the contamination which could delay
clinical trials and adversely harm our business. If we or our CMOs are
4 unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the
FDA or other regulatory authorities, or in accordance with the strict
regulatory requirements, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we
6 need to commercialize such products.
The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraph above
were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully

a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active ingredient
in its “lead” product candidate, were not merely hypothetical.
On December 20, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release announcing
recent financing activities as well as its ongoing business initiatives, including the
planned BLA submission for Anktiva, filed with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to the current
report on Form 8-K, dated December 20, 2021 signed by Defendant Sachs, which
represented as follows:
The company’s platforms are based on the foundation of four separate

6 the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed to continue.
7 118. On March 1, 2022, ImmunityBio filed a post-effective amendment to the
8 Shelf Registration Statement (as amended, the “Shelf Registration Statement
9 Amendment No. 1”), which was signed by the Individual Defendants. The Shelf
10 Registration Statement Amendment No. 1 expressly incorporated by reference the
11 March 10, 2021 Form 8-K, including the materially false and misleading statements set
12 forth in ¶¶ 95-97.

20 a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active ingredient
21 in its “lead” product candidate, were not merely hypothetical.
22 120. On March 1, 2022, ImmunityBio filed an annual report with the SEC on
23 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”), which was
24 signed by the Individual Defendants. The 2021 Form 10-K touted that the Company

research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations
and development teams.
The 2021 Form 10-K also assured investors that ImmunityBio develops its
products in accordance with cGMP:
ImmunityBio has adopted a strategic position to be vertically integrated
and develop its products according to the FDA’s GMP standards for
6 large-scale manufacturing, even during Phase 2 clinical trial development.
Biological upstream and downstream manufacturing capabilities, with its
attendant know-how and regulatory compliance for approval, have long
8 lead times. We have adopted an approach for preparedness to provide our
vaccine, immunotherapy and cell therapy products at a global scale. As
such, we have established our own plants and have access to facilities on a
10 global basis.
11 122. In the 2021 Form 10-K, the Company boasted that the third-party it used to
12 manufacture Anktiva, specifically, had robust manufacturing standards:
13 For our Anktiva product candidate, we have contracted with a multi-
national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities
in the U.S., Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and future
15 commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process
development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity
production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors.
The 2021 Form 10-K also outlined certain risks which “could” have a
significant adverse impact on ImmunityBio’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, or prospects if they came to pass, including the following:
The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, and we may
encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process
22 development, quality control, or scaling-up of our manufacturing
capabilities. If we or our related parties, or any of our third-party
manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide

final product testing. If microbial, viral, environmental or other
contaminants are discovered in our product candidates or in the
2 manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such
manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of
time to investigate and remedy the contamination which could delay
4 clinical trials and adversely harm our business. If we or our CMOs are
unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the
FDA or other regulatory authorities, or in accordance with the strict
6 regulatory requirements, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we
need to commercialize such products.
8 141. The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
9 were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
10 necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully
11 above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture
12 Anktiva at a facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP
13 failings; (ii) the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed
14 to continue; and, accordingly, (iii) the risks posed by a failure to comply with cGMP at
15 a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active ingredient
16 in its “lead” product candidate under review by the FDA, were not merely hypothetical.
17 142. On November 10, 2022, ImmunityBio issued a press release announcing
18 the publication of the full results of the Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG in BCG-
19 unresponsive patients with the CIS form of NMIBC, which represented as follows:
20 The company has established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale with
cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as
well as extensive and seasoned R&D, clinical trial, and regulatory
22 operations, and development teams.

1 facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP failings; and (ii)
2 the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed to continue.
3 144. On February 7, 2023, ImmunityBio filed with the SEC a shelf registration
4 statement on Form S-3 to place an unspecified number of debt and equity securities not
5 to exceed a total aggregate price of $750 million on the “shelf,” which contained a
6 prospectus relating thereto (as supplemented, the “February 2023 Shelf Registration
7 Statement”). The February 2023 Shelf Registration Statement was signed by the
8 Individual Defendants. The SEC declared the February 2023 Shelf Registration
9 Statement effective on February 9, 2023. On February 16, 2023, ImmunityBio filed a
10 final prospectus supplement to the February 2023 Shelf Registration Statement with the
11 SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) (the “February 2023 Prospectus Supplement”), to
12 facilitate a registered direct offering of approximately $50 million in ImmunityBio
13 common stock and warrants to purchase up to a total of $60 million in ImmunityBio
14 common stock. As supplemented by the February 2023 Prospectus Supplement, the
15 February 2023 Shelf Registration Statement declared that it was “unclear” when, or if,
16 the FDA would approve the pending Anktiva BLA:
17 In May 2022, we announced the submission of a Biologics License
Application (BLA) to the FDA for our product candidate, Anktiva in
combination with BCG for the treatment of patients with BCG-
19 unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease. In
July 2022, we announced the FDA has accepted our BLA for review and
set a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of
21 May 23, 2023. It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at
all.
The February 2023 Shelf Registration Statement also represented as
follows:
We have established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing
expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned
research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations
and development teams.

1 146. In addition, the February 2023 Shelf Registration Statement expressly
2 incorporated by reference the 2021 Form 10-K, the 1Q 2022 Form 10-Q, the 2Q 2022
3 Form 10-Q, and the 3Q 2022 Form 10-Q, including the materially false and misleading
4 statements set forth in ¶¶ 120-123, 125-126, 136-137, and 139-140.
5 147. The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
6 were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
7 necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully
8 above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture
9 Anktiva at a facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP
10 failings; (ii) the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed
11 to continue; (iii) the FDA observed an array of significant cGMP violations at the
12 aforementioned facility during the pre-license inspection for Anktiva which indicated
13 that the firm’s quality unit was not effectively exercising its authority and/or
14 responsibilities; and, accordingly, (iv) the risks posed by a failure to comply with cGMP
15 at a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active
16 ingredient in its “lead” product candidate under review by the FDA, were not merely
17 hypothetical; and (v) far from being “uncertain” if the FDA would approve the Anktiva
18 BLA, any such approval was no longer viable.
19 148. On March 1, 2023, ImmunityBio filed an annual report with the SEC on
20 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), which was
21 signed by the Individual Defendants. The 2022 Form 10-K touted that the Company
22 maintained cGMP manufacturing resources, stating in relevant part:
23 We have established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing
expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned
25 research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations
and development teams.
The 2022 Form 10-K also assured investors that ImmunityBio develops its
products in accordance with cGMP:
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.513 Page 56
of 81
ImmunityBio has adopted a strategic position to be vertically integrated
and develop its products according to the FDA’s GMP standards for
2 large-scale manufacturing, even during Phase 2 clinical trial development.
Biological upstream and downstream manufacturing capabilities, with its
attendant know-how and regulatory compliance for approval, have long
4 lead times. We have adopted an approach for preparedness to provide our
vaccine, immunotherapy and cell therapy products at a global scale. As
such, we have established our own plants and have access to facilities on a
6 global basis.
In the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company boasted that the third-party it used to
manufacture Anktiva, specifically, had robust manufacturing standards:
For our N-803 product candidate, we have contracted with a multi-
10 national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities
in the U.S., Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and future
commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process
12 development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity
production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors.
The 2022 Form 10-K also outlined certain risks which “could” have a
significant adverse impact on ImmunityBio’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, or prospects if they came to pass, including the following:
The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, and we may
encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process
18 development, quality control, or scaling-up of our manufacturing
capabilities. If we or our related parties, or any of our third-party
manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide
adequate supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our
products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may
be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.
. . .
Currently we manufacture our product candidates or we may use third-
24 party CMOs or some of our related parties to manufacture our product
candidates.
. . .
In addition, the manufacturing process and facilities for any products that
we may develop are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority
approval processes, and we or our CMOs will need to meet all applicable

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.514 Page 57
of 81
FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP, on
an ongoing basis. The cGMP requirements include quality control, quality
2 assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA
and other regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through facility
inspections. Manufacturing facilities must submit to pre-approval
4 inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit our
marketing applications, including BLAs and NDAs, to the FDA.
Manufacturers are also subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory
6 authority inspections following marketing approval. Further, we and our
third-party CMOs must supply all necessary Chemistry, Manufacturing and
Controls (CMC) documentation in support of a BLA or NDA on a timely
8 basis. Our or our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities may be unable to
comply with our specifications, cGMP, and with other FDA, state, and
foreign regulatory requirements, and there is no guarantee that we or our
10 CMOs will be able to successfully pass all aspects of a pre-approval
inspection by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities.
Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of
adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the
13 properties or stability of product candidates that may not be detectable in
final product testing. If microbial, viral, environmental or other
contaminants are discovered in our product candidates or in the
15 manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such
manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of
time to investigate and remedy the contamination which could delay
17 clinical trials and adversely harm our business. If we or our CMOs are
unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the
FDA or other regulatory authorities, or in accordance with the strict
19 regulatory requirements, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we
need to commercialize such products.
21 152. Finally, the 2022 Form 10-K declared that it was “unclear” when, or if, the
22 FDA would approve the pending Anktiva BLA:
23 In May 2022, we announced the submission of a Biologics License
Application (BLA) to the FDA for our product candidate, Anktiva in
combination with BCG for the treatment of patients with BCG-
25 unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease. In
July 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted our BLA for review
and set a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date
27 of May 23, 2023. It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at
all.

1 153. The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
2 were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
3 necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully
4 above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture
5 Anktiva at a facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP
6 failings; (ii) the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed
7 to continue; (iii) the FDA observed an array of significant cGMP violations at the
8 aforementioned facility during the pre-license inspection for Anktiva which indicated
9 that the firm’s quality unit was not effectively exercising its authority and/or
10 responsibilities; and, accordingly, (iv) the risks posed by a failure to comply with cGMP
11 at a CMO that manufactured a product for ImmunityBio, particularly the active
12 ingredient in its “lead” product candidate under review by the FDA, were not merely
13 hypothetical; and (v) far from being “uncertain” if the FDA would approve the Anktiva
14 BLA, any such approval was no longer viable.
15 154. On March 20, 2023, ImmunityBio filed a current report on Form 8-K with
16 the SEC (the “March 20, 2023 Form 8-K”) to announce various ongoing business
17 initiatives and updates, which was signed by Defendant Sachs. Among other things, the
18 March 20, 2023 Form 8-K declared that it was “unclear” when, or if, the FDA would
19 approve the pending Anktiva BLA:
20 As previously disclosed, in May 2022 ImmunityBio, Inc. (the “Company”)
announced the submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to
the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for N-803 in
22 combination with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”) for the treatment of
patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ (“CIS”)
with or without Ta or T1 disease. In July 2022, we announced that the
24 FDA had accepted our BLA for review and set a target Prescription Drug
User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date of May 23, 2023. The Company
continues to engage in ongoing discussions and dialogue with the FDA,
26 including the proposed label for the product candidate under review in the
BLA. It remains unclear if the FDA will approve our BLA on the
PDUFA action date, if at all.

of 81
1 155. The March 20, 2023 Form 8-K also informed investors that the Company
2 was focused on preparing for the approval of the Anktiva BLA:
3 As the Company remains focused on preparing for the potential approval
of the BLA by the FDA as described above, it intends to continue to
explore opportunities to engage in incremental financing transactions to
5 raise the working capital needed to fund the Company’s ongoing operations
through the anticipated May 23, 2023 PDUFA date and execute the
Company’s business strategy and initiatives.
The statements identified in bold and italicized text in the paragraphs above
were materially false and misleading when made, or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements not misleading, because, as described more fully
above, ImmunityBio failed to disclose that (i) it relied on a CMO to manufacture
Anktiva at a facility that suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP
failings; (ii) the aforementioned cGMP failings were not remediated and, thus, allowed

that the firm’s quality unit was not effectively exercising its authority and/or
responsibilities; and, accordingly, (iv) far from being “uncertain” if the FDA would
approve the Anktiva BLA, any such approval was no longer viable.
THE TRUTH EMERGES
During the Class Period, before the truth of Defendants’ fraud was
revealed, the market as a whole remained in the dark as to the extensive and rampant
cGMP failures at the CMO used by ImmunityBio to manufacture Anktiva. The market,
including analysts who follow ImmunityBio, did not expect manufacturing issues to
pose a threat to the approvability of the Anktiva BLA. For example, Piper Sandler
analyst Joseph Catanzaro, Ph. D., said in a note on September 29, 2022 that, “overall we
continue to see a high likelihood of approval” for the pending Anktiva BLA. The note
acknowledged that there were “a few questions” that could pose obstacles to approval,
but manufacturing issues was not one of them.

of 81
1 158. Thus, the market was shocked on May 11, 2023, when ImmunityBio,
2 during pre-market hours, filed a current report with the SEC on Form 8-K (the “May 11,
3 2023 Form 8-K”) which disclosed that, on May 9, 2023, the FDA delivered a CRL to
4 the Company in response to the Anktiva BLA arising from deficiencies observed during
5 the FDA’s pre-license inspection of its CMOs. Specifically, the May 11, 2023 Form 8-
6 K disclosed, in relevant part:
7 ImmunityBio, Inc. (the “Company”) announces that it has received a
complete response letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) on May 9, 2023 regarding its Biologics License Application
9 (“BLA”) for its product candidate, Anktiva™ (N-803) in combination with
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”) for the treatment of patients with BCG-
unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (“NMIBC”) with
11 carcinoma in situ (“CIS”) with or without Ta or T1 disease. The letter
indicates that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the BLA in
its present form, and the FDA has made recommendations to address the
13 issues raised.
14 The deficiencies relate to the FDA’s pre-license inspection of the
Company’s third-party contract manufacturing organizations.
Satisfactory resolution of the observations noted at the pre-license
16 inspection is required before the BLA may be approved. The FDA further
provided recommendations specific to additional Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) issues and assays to be resolved.
On this news, ImmunityBio common stock fell $3.43 per share, or 55.14%,
on heavy volume to close at $2.79 on May 11, 2023.
ImmunityBio’s receipt of the CRL received widespread coverage in the
press. Many stories linked the stock drop specifically to the CRL. For example,
industry publication BioSpace reported on May 11, 2023, that “ImmunityBio took a hit
on Thursday as the FDA rejected its bladder cancer treatment due to deficiencies with
the company’s third-party contract manufacturer,” noting the stock was “down nearly
60% in premarket trading.” Similarly, Seeking Alpha issued a story that day with the
headline “ImmunityBio crashes 57% after FDA snub for cancer therapy.” A report by
Yahoo Finance on May 12, 2023, also highlighted that “[s]hares of ImmunityBio IBRX

1 were down 55.1% on Thursday after management announced that FDA issued a
2 complete response letter (‘CRL’) to its biologics license application (‘BLA’) seeking
3 approval for combination use of its lead pipeline candidate, Anktiva (N-803) . . . .”
4 ADDITIONAL FACTS PROBATIVE OF SCIENTER
5 161. The Individual Defendants acted with scienter because at the time they
6 issued public documents and other statements in ImmunityBio’s name, they knew, or
7 with extreme recklessness disregarded the fact that such statements were materially
8 false and misleading or omitted material facts. The Individual Defendants knew such
9 documents and statements would be issued or disseminated to the investing public,
10 knew that persons were likely to rely upon those misrepresentations and omissions, and
11 knowingly and recklessly participated in the issuance and dissemination of such
12 statements and documents as primary violators of the federal securities laws.
13 162. A holistic examination of the facts and circumstances, including those set
14 forth below, collectively supports a strong inference that throughout the Class Period,
15 Defendants knew or, at a minimum, recklessly disregarded, that their statements were
16 materially false and misleading.
17 A. Defendants Had A Known Duty to Ensure That the Their
Manufacturing CMOs Complied with cGMP
The FDA’s cGMP regulations recognize that sponsors commonly use
CMOs to perform some or all manufacturing activities. See 21 C.F.R. § 200.10(b).
These regulations specify that the sponsor remains legally responsible for approving or
rejecting drug products that are manufactured by a CMO. See 21 C.F.R. § 211.22(a).
Importantly, the FDA has emphasized that this duty is non-transferrable
and non-delegable in a CMO arrangement. Accordingly, the FDA has advised that “if
the license manufacturer enters into an agreement with a [CMO], the license
manufacturer must ensure that the facility complies with the applicable standards,”
including, specifically, cGMP. FDA, Guidance for Industry: Cooperative
Manufacturing Arrangements for Licensed Biologics (2008).
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.519 Page 62
of 81
1 165. Consistent with the guidelines outlined above, the Individual Defendants
2 knew that ImmunityBio was ultimately responsible for AGC’s compliance with
3 applicable FDA rules and regulations, including cGMP, since before the start of the
4 Class Period. In the same SEC filing on January 29, 2021 discussed above, Defendants
5 Soon-Shiong and Adcock recognized that “our CMOs will need to meet all applicable
6 FDA . . . requirements, including cGMP, on an ongoing basis,” but admitted, “to the
7 extent we use CMOs, we are ultimately responsible for the manufacture of our
8 products.” The Individual Defendants, including Defendant Sachs, made these same
9 statements in ImmunityBio’s periodic reports filed during the Class Period.
10 B. AGC Was Required to Share Manufacturing Information with
ImmunityBio, Including Significant cGMP Issues
Because the obligation to comply with cGMP is non-transferable, the FDA
has advised for years that “[t]he license manufacturer must have a procedure in place for
receiving information from a contract facility on all deviations, complaints, and adverse
events” that arise during manufacturing. FDA, Guidance for Industry: Cooperative
Manufacturing Arrangements for Licensed Biologics (2008). The FDA also suggested
that CMO agreements should include “procedures to regularly assess the [CMO]’s
compliance” including, but not limited to, “review of records and manufacturing
deviations and defects, and periodic audits” as well as “assurance from the [CMO] that
any FDA list of inspectional observations will be shared with the license manufacturer.”
Id.
In 2016, the FDA released new guidance which specified that “[t]here
should be a written and approved contract or formal agreement between a company and
its [CMOs] that defines in detail the GMP responsibilities, including quality measures,
of each party.” ICH, Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (2016). That FDA also specified that any “[c]hanges in the
process, equipment, test methods, specifications, or other contractual requirements
should not be made unless the contract giver is informed and approves of the change.”
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.520 Page 63
of 81
1 Id. Later that year, the FDA adopted further guidance which recommended that parties
2 enter into “quality agreements” to do so. FDA, Contract Manufacturing Arrangements
3 for Drugs: Quality Agreements, Guidance for Industry (2016). Consistent with its
4 previous guidance, the FDA advised that such agreements should contain provisions for
5 reporting, among other things, deviations, FDA inspection observations, proposed
6 process changes, and all laboratory test results conducted by the CMO, including, in
7 particular, any that generate results which are out of specification. Id.
8 168. ImmunityBio maintained at least one such quality agreement with AGC
9 during the Class Period (the “Quality Agreement”). As CW4 explained, the Quality
10 Agreement that ImmunityBio had with AGC was “standard” and required AGC to
11 provide typical information, including any deviations, out of specification tests and any
12 FDA inspection observations. This was echoed by CW3, who indicated that the Quality
13 Agreement required AGC to provide findings of any inspection by a government
14 agency, batch records, batch disposition reports, certain deviation notices, and reports
15 for any deviation investigations. As detailed by CW3, the extensive information
16 contained in the batch records (¶ 68) were used by AGC to decide whether the batch
17 was successful, in which case it signs off on a batch disposition and provides the same
18 records to ImmunityBio so it could perform the same analysis. According to CW3,
19 ImmunityBio was “100 percent” aware of each instance when AGC missed a target date
20 for batch disposition through this reporting mechanism.
21 169. As is standard, the Quality Agreement during the start of CW3 tenure only
22 required AGC to notify ImmunityBio about certain types of deviations from the
23 established manufacturing process, including, for example, those deemed “critical.” But
24 CW3 reported that between August 2021 and November 2022, there was “a verbal or
25 written agreement for all deviations.” According to CW3, this change was made
26 because “they [ImmunityBio] wanted to see all of them,” even those classified as minor.
27 Thereafter, said CW3, “they [ImmunityBio] had direct awareness of all the deviations
28 and problems that arose with each of the batches from a quality perspective.”
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.521 Page 64
of 81
1 170. In addition, AGC maintained a variety of internal policies that required it to
2 either notify ImmunityBio or obtain its approval for certain matters. For example,
3 AGC’s internal policy for stability testing required it to confirm with ImmunityBio, in
4 the event testing must be performed outside the test window, that samples can be
5 returned to the long-term storage location until testing can be performed.
6 171. Consistent with these reporting mechanisms, as described above, it was
7 common knowledge in ImmunityBio’s manufacturing and quality departments from
8 approximately mid-2021 through February 2023 that AGC suffered from myriad cGMP
9 problems, including a recurring inability to timely release batch records, close
10 deviations, conduct stability testing, and running out of critical reference material
11 needed for testing. Indeed, CW1 pointed out that ImmunityBio began to “remind” AGC
12 at each test window to perform the testing because of the known buildup of misses
13 before the Anktiva BLA.
14 C. The Individual Defendants Were Intimately Aware of the Significant
cGMP Failings at AGC Throughout the Class Period
As provided above (¶¶ 68-71), AGC was consistently unable to provide
batch records, deviation reports, and stability tests on schedule throughout the Class
Period. CW3 explained that timely batch disposition was especially “important” to
ImmunityBio leadership in 2021 because the results were needed for the Anktiva BLA.
Numerous CWs confirm that Defendant Adcock regularly met with AGC
executives during the Class Period to discuss the firm’s continued delays. CW3
attended monthly meetings with Adcock and ImmunityBio’s Chief Operating Officer,
Leonard Sender, beginning in August 2021, during which they discussed missed target
dates for batch dispositions and deviation close outs. CW3 said these meetings became
more frequent in the lead up to the FDA inspection. CW1 was personally aware of
approximately 10 such meetings between mid-2021 and 2022 attended by Adcock and
Sender as well as ImmunityBio’s Senior Director of Quality Control, Scott Yuen. This
is consistent with the account of CW4, who recalled that Adcock and Sender were

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.522 Page 65
of 81
1 meeting with AGC’s senior executives “every other week” during this time. CW4
2 emphasized that Adcock and Sender were meeting with AGC so often because AGC
3 was extremely late submitting batch records for ImmunityBio to review for final release.
4 174. CW3 also confirmed that Adcock and Sender discussed the PPQ runs
5 during the routine meetings they held with AGC.
6 175. According to CW1, in 2022, ImmunityBio placed contract workers in the
7 AGC facility to assist with the growing backlog because AGC was unable to fix the
8 problem on its own. CW1 heard from colleagues that the contract workers were a
9 significant cost and would have, at the very least, required Defendant Sachs approval.
10 Unfortunately, even after this, AGC was still unable to stay on schedule, said CW1.
11 176. Notably, CW2 said that Defendant Soon-Shiong “personally reviewed” and
12 “approved” the Anktiva BLA before it was filed. CW2 became aware of this from a
13 colleague who explained that the Company was waiting for Soon-Shiong to sign off
14 before formally submitting the BLA. This is notable because the BLA would need to
15 address, among other things, the significant number of missed stability checks as well as
16 the failed batch runs of Anktiva that took place before then.
17 177. Between the BLA filing and the FDA’s pre-license inspection,
18 ImmunityBio continued to work with AGC to shore up its cGMP deficiencies. For
19 example, CW2 advised that, before departing the Company in November 2022,
20 ImmunityBio maintained a spreadsheet internally known as the “pre-approval inspection
21 tracker” which cataloged, in detail, all of the potential cGMP issues at each
22 manufacturing location, including AGC. CW2 commented that “there were a lot of eyes
23 on that,” and confirmed that ImmunityBio leadership reviewed it.
24 178. As provided above (¶ 77), the FDA notified AGC on November 1, 2022,
25 that it planned to hold a pre-license inspection at the facility it used to manufacture
26 Anktiva in February 2023. In connection therewith, the FDA informed AGC that the
27 inspection would span two weeks and involve six inspectors. CW3 noted that this is
28 “on the far side of the high intensity spectrum,” explaining that pre-approval inspections

of 81
1 of this type are typically conducted by one or two inspectors over several days. CW3
2 confirmed that AGC shared this information with ImmunityBio and recalled that, upon
3 learning about the scope of the inspection, “everybody was nervous” at ImmunityBio,
4 including Defendants Soon-Shiong and Adcock. In fact, CW3 said “they were very
5 concerned” after learning this.
6 179. CW3 said that this prompted ImmunityBio to hold a “mock” inspection for
7 several days in January 2023 in which its representatives had full access to its
8 documentation and facilities. As CW3 explained, “they [ImmunityBio] wouldn’t have
9 asked for a pre-audit if they weren’t concerned.” CW3 emphasized that Defendant
10 Adcock and Leonard Sender were “intricately involved” in the mock inspection,
11 including “the planning of it, the execution of it, the results of it—all aspects.” Neither
12 attended the audit itself, but CW3 indicated that they were updated along the way. CW1
13 also recalled that ImmunityBio conducted its own inspection at AGC in or around
14 January 2023 and confirmed that Scott Yuen attended the mock inspection from
15 ImmunityBio.
16 180. Both CW3 and CW1 recalled that the mock inspection uncovered a host of
17 objectionable conditions that required remediation by AGC before the FDA’s official
18 inspection in February 2023. Among other things, CW3 recalled that one of
19 ImmunityBio’s specialists identified gaps and weaknesses in AGC’s data integrity
20 system. CW1 learned from Scott Yuen, who attended the mock inspection, that the
21 observations noted deficiencies in cGMP compliance, including general concerns about
22 AGC’s repeated testing delays. CW3 confirmed that ImmunityBio’s top leadership was
23 made fully aware of the findings of the mock inspection at the time it concluded.
24 Indeed, CW3 personally presented the findings of the mock inspection to Defendant
25 Adcock and Leonard Sender.
26 181. Based on the findings from the mock inspection, CW3 said that
27 ImmunityBio leadership became engaged “on a very technical level” with prep for the
28 FDA inspection because they “knew this could be a risk.” Among other things,
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.524 Page 67
of 81
1 ImmunityBio assembled a list of all “gaps” that needed to be closed before the FDA
2 inspection. But CW3 reported that the team was unable to close all gaps before the
3 FDA inspection. As CW3 explained, “there wasn’t enough time between the pre-audit
4 and the actual audit to completely cover everything.”
5 182. The FDA’s pre-license inspection at AGC took place between February 2,
6 2023, and February 10, 2023. CW3 confirmed that ImmunityBio sent at least six
7 representatives to attend the inspection, and there was a plan in place on how to update
8 ImmunityBio on the progress of the inspection.
9 183. However, as CW3 highlighted, the plan changed after the FDA observed a
10 number of deficiencies on the first day of the inspection. Leonard Sender got “nervous”
11 after hearing this from AGC and, soon thereafter, Defendant Soon-Shiong demanded
12 that he wanted a personal call at the end of each day to discuss how the inspection went
13 that day between ImmunityBio’s top leadership and AGC’s top leadership, including
14 CW3. In addition, Defendant Adcock flew up to Washington overnight to be present
15 for the next several days of the inspection.
16 184. As the inspection progressed, the ImmunityBio management team became
17 increasingly anxious. At first, Soon-Shiong demanded that CW3 allow ImmunityBio
18 employees to be “in the room” with the inspectors. CW3 refused because it would be
19 improper, which sent Soon-Shiong into “yelling.” Eventually CW3 agreed to have an
20 AGC employee frequently feed information back to ImmunityBio leadership about what
21 was happening, for example, “here are the discussions going on, here are the questions
22 the FDA is asking, here’s how we intend to answer.” CW3 commented “[i]t was as real
23 time as possible.” In addition, CW3 verified that the daily leadership call demanded by
24 Soon-Shiong took place as scheduled every day after the end of the inspection. CW3
25 participated on the calls and added that they were attended on the ImmunityBio side by
26 Defendants Soon-Shiong and Adcock as well as Leonard Sender. The Individual
27 Defendants were fully informed about the results of the FDA’s pre-license inspection.

D. The Fact That ImmunityBio Initiated Plans to Manufacture Anktiva
1 In-House Supports an Inference of Scienter
2 185. The inference that Defendants were aware of the subpar manufacturing
3 standards and cGMP failures at AGC, and thus the inference of scienter, is further
4 supported by the fact that ImmunityBio initiated plans to manufacture Anktiva in-house
5 midway through the Class Period. Specifically, by no later than March 1, 2022,
6 ImmunityBio initiated plans to establish a cGMP-compliant facility in California, which
7 included a large space for the production of antibodies and fusion proteins, including,
8 specifically, Anktiva.
9 186. The process of building a cGMP-compliant facility, either from an existing
10 space or from scratch, is very time-consuming and expensive. Similarly, the process of
11 “transferring” the manufacturing technology from one facility to another consistent with
12 the specifications for the product is also very time-consuming and expensive. These
13 activities independently and in combination would require new FDA approvals.
14 187. At the very least, ImmunityBio would not take on the significant cost and
15 time required to build, qualify, and receive approval for such a facility if it was satisfied
16 with the services provided to it by AGC.
17 E. FDA Approval of Anktiva Was Critical to ImmunityBio’s Financial
Success
It is reasonable to infer that Defendants were aware of the manufacturing
issues that AGC reported or otherwise communicated to ImmunityBio, including the
inspection observations made by the FDA in March 2021 and July 2021, given the
critical importance of the Anktiva BLA to ImmunityBio’s continued success. As of the
start of the Class Period, ImmunityBio was a clinical-stage company with no approved
drugs and, thus, no source of meaningful revenues. At the time its “lead” product
candidate, and by far the most developed in its product portfolio, was Anktiva. As such,
on January 29, 2021, Defendants Soon-Shiong and Adcock stated in SEC filings made
in connection with the Legacy ImmunityBio-NantKwest merger that “[t]he combined
company’s business depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.526 Page 69
of 81
1 approval and commercialization” of its three main product candidates, including
2 Anktiva. Adcock made this same statement in an SEC filing on March 10, 2021.
3 F. Soon-Shiong Was a Controlling Hands-On Manager
4 189. According to CW3, Defendant Soon-Shiong was an “extreme control
5 freak.” As CW3 explained, it was not uncommon for Soon-Shiong to yell at people
6 during business meetings. CW3 also witnessed meetings where Soon-Shiong was
7 “telling everybody what to do.” It appeared to CW3 that Soon-Shiong was the one
8 calling the shots at ImmunityBio, often issuing orders to Defendant Adcock, CEO of
9 ImmunityBio.
10 G. Respondeat Superior and Agency Principles Apply
11 190. ImmunityBio is liable for the acts of the Individual Defendants and other
12 Company officers, directors, employees, and agents under the doctrine of respondeat
13 superior and common law principles of agency as all wrongful acts alleged herein were
14 carried out within the scope of their employment or agency with the authority or
15 apparent authority to do so. The scienter of the Individual Defendants and other
16 Company officers, employees , and agents is therefore imputable to ImmunityBio.
17 LOSS CAUSATION
18 191. At all relevant times, ImmunityBio common stock traded in an open, well-
19 developed, and efficient market which promptly digested new information regarding the
20 Company from all reasonably accessible public sources and reflected such information
21 in the price of ImmunityBio’s common stock.
22 192. As described above, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false
23 and misleading statements which misrepresented and/or failed to disclose the adverse
24 facts detailed herein. Defendants’ false and misleading statements caused ImmunityBio
25 securities to trade at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class Period and, thus,
26 operated as a fraud or deceit on Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class who
27 purchased or otherwise acquired such securities before such the inflation was removed.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.527 Page 70
of 81
1 193. As detailed herein, the price of ImmunityBio common stock fell
2 precipitously on high volume in response to disclosures made by the Company on May
3 11, 2023. The price of ImmunityBio common stock fell in response to each such
4 disclosure by revealing information that removed part of the inflation introduced by
5 Defendants’ previous misstatements and omissions, causing real economic loss to Lead
6 Plaintiff and other members of the Class who purchased ImmunityBio common stock
7 during the Class Period at inflated prices.
8 194. Each decline in the price of ImmunityBio common stock referenced above
9 was a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ misstatements or omissions being
10 revealed to the market and/or the materialization of risks concealed by the fraud. The
11 timing and magnitude of each such price decline negates any inference that the losses
12 suffered by Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class were caused by changed
13 market conditions, macroeconomic factors, or Company-specific facts unrelated to the
14 fraud alleged herein.
15 195. Accordingly, Defendants’ wrongful conduct directly and proximately
16 caused Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class to suffer economic losses, i.e.,
17 damages under the federal securities laws.
18 PRESUMPTION OF RELIANCE
19 196. Lead Plaintiff and the Class is entitled to a presumption of reliance under
20 the fraud-on-the-market doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court in Basic v. Levinson,
21 485 U.S. 224 (1998). Such a presumption is appropriate because, among other things:
22 (a) during the Class Period, Defendants made public misrepresentations
23 or failed to disclose material facts necessary to make the public statements that were
24 made not misleading;
25 (b) such misrepresentations and/or omissions were material;
26 (c) the Company’s common stock traded in an efficient market;
27 (d) the misrepresentations and/or omissions would tend to induce a
28 reasonable investor to misjudge the value of ImmunityBio’s common stock; and
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.528 Page 71
of 81
1 (e) Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class purchased
2 ImmunityBio common stock between the time Defendants misrepresented or failed to
3 disclose material facts necessary to make the statements that were made not misleading
4 and the time the true facts were disclosed, without knowledge of the true and/or omitted
5 facts.
6 197. At all relevant times, the market for ImmunityBio’s common stock was
7 efficient for the following reasons, among others:
8 (a) ImmunityBio’s common stock met the requirements for listing, and
9 were listed, on the NASDAQ, a highly efficient and automated market;
10 (b) as a regulated issuer, ImmunityBio filed periodic public reports with
11 the SEC;
12 (c) throughout the Class Period, ImmunityBio’s common stock was
13 highly liquid, with an average daily trading volume of 1.9 million shares;
14 (d) ImmunityBio regularly communicated with public investors via
15 established market communication mechanisms, including through regular
16 dissemination of press releases on the national circuits of major newswire services and
17 through other wide-ranging public disclosures, such as communications with the
18 financial press and other similar reporting services; and/or
19 (e) ImmunityBio was followed by securities analysts employed by
20 brokerage firms who wrote reports about the Company, and these reports were
21 distributed to the sales forces and certain customers of their respective brokerage firms,
22 and, thus, entered the public marketplace; and
23 (f) unexpected company-specific news was reflected and incorporated
24 into the stock price for ImmunityBio’s common stock.
25 198. As a result of the foregoing, the market for ImmunityBio’s common stock
26 promptly digested new information regarding the Company from all reasonably
27 accessible public sources and reflected such information in the price of ImmunityBio’s
28 common stock. Under these circumstances, all purchasers of ImmunityBio common

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.529 Page 72
of 81
1 stock during the Class Period suffered similar injury through their purchase of such
2 securities at artificially inflated prices, and a presumption of reliance applies.
3 199. A Class-wide presumption of reliance is also appropriate under the
4 Supreme Court’s holding in Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S.
5 128 (1972), because the Class’s claims center, in large part, upon Defendants’ material
6 omissions. Because this action involves Defendants’ failure to disclose material adverse
7 information regarding the Company’s business operations and financial prospects—
8 information that Defendants were obligated by law to disclose—positive proof of
9 reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery.
10 NO SAFE HARBOR
11 200. The statutory safe harbor provided for forward-looking statements under
12 certain circumstances does not apply to any of the statements alleged to be false or
13 misleading herein.
14 201. None of the statements alleged herein to be false or misleading are
15 forward-looking statements. Such statements address facts and conditions existing at
16 the time the statements were made. Furthermore, none of the historic or present-tense
17 statements alleged herein to be false or misleading were assumptions underlying or
18 relating to any plan, projection, or statement of future economic performance, as they
19 were not stated to be such an assumption when made, nor were any of the projections or
20 forecasts made by Defendants expressly related to or stated to be dependent on those
21 historic or present-tense statements when made.
22 202. To the extent certain of the statements alleged herein to be false or
23 misleading may be characterized as forward-looking, they were not identified as
24 “forward-looking statements” when made, and they were not accompanied by any
25 meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual
26 results to differ materially from those in the purportedly forward-looking statements.
27 Any purported cautionary language warned only of theoretical future risks at times
28 when the risks were not merely hypothetical Moreover, the purported cautionary
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.530 Page 73
of 81
1 language failed to adjust over time, using the same theoretical tone even after concrete
2 changes of circumstance. In the alternative, Defendants are liable for those forward-
3 looking statements because at the time each such statement was made, the speaker had
4 actual knowledge, or recklessly disregarded the risk, that the forward-looking statement
5 was materially false or misleading, and/or the forward-looking statement was authorized
6 or approved by an executive officer of ImmunityBio who knew, or recklessly
7 disregarded the risk, that the statement was false when made.
8 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS
9 203. Lead Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the
10 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of Class consisting of all persons and entities
11 other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired ImmunityBio common
12 stock between March 7, 2021 and May 10, 2023, both dates inclusive, and were
13 damaged thereby.
14 204. The members of the Class are so numerous and geographically dispersed
15 that joinder of all members is impracticable. The disposition of their claims in a class
16 action will provide substantial benefits to the parties and the Court. During the Class
17 Period, ImmunityBio common stock was actively traded on the NASDAQ. As of May
18 5, 2023, there were approximately 435,984,529 shares of ImmunityBio common stock
19 outstanding. While the exact number of Class members is unknown to Lead Plaintiff at
20 this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate discovery, Lead Plaintiff
21 believes that there are hundreds or thousands of members in the proposed Class. Record
22 owners and other members of the Class may be identified from records maintained by
23 ImmunityBio or its transfer agent, and may be notified of the pendency of this action by
24 mail, using a form of notice similar to that customarily used in securities class actions.
25 205. Lead Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the members of the
26 Class. All members of the Class were similarly affected by Defendants’ wrongful
27 conduct in violation of the Exchange Act, as complained of herein.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.531 Page 74
of 81
1 206. Lead Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
2 members of the Class and has retained counsel competent and experienced in class
3 actions and securities litigation. Lead Plaintiff has no interests antagonistic to, or in
4 conflict with, those of the Class.
5 207. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and
6 predominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class,
7 including:
8 (a) whether Defendants’ acts alleged herein violated the federal
9 securities laws and/or SEC rules promulgated thereunder;
10 (b) whether Defendants’ statements during the Class period
11 misrepresented material facts or omitted material facts necessary in order to make the
12 statements made, in the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
13 (c) whether Defendants made such statements;
14 (d) whether Defendants acted with the requisite level of scienter;
15 (e) whether and to what extent the material misstatements and omissions
16 alleged herein artificially inflated the market price of ImmunityBio common stock; and
17 (f) whether the members of the Class have sustained damages and, if so,
18 the proper measure of damages.
19 208. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and
20 efficient adjudication of this controversy because, among other reasons, joinder of all
21 members is impracticable. Furthermore, as the damages suffered by individual
22 members of the Class may be relatively small, the expense and burden of individual
23 litigation make it impossible for members of the Class individually to redress the
24 wrongs done to them individually. There will be no difficulty in the management of this
25 action as a class action.

COUNT I
(Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5
2 Against All Defendants)
3 209. Lead Plaintiff repeats and realleges every allegation pleaded above as if
4 fully set forth herein.
5 210. This Count is brought against Defendants under Section 10(b) of the
6 Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
7 by the SEC, codified at 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
8 211. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants, individually and in concert,
9 directly or indirectly, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
10 including but not limited to the mails and the internet, and/or the facilities of the
11 NASDAQ, engaged in a plan, scheme, conspiracy and course of conduct, pursuant to
12 which they knowingly or recklessly engaged in acts, transactions, practices and courses
13 of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon Lead Plaintiff and the other
14 members of the Class; made various untrue statements of material facts and omitted to
15 state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
16 circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and employed devices,
17 schemes and artifices to defraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities.
18 212. As alleged herein, Defendants made or otherwise caused ImmunityBio to
19 issue the materially false or misleading statements specified above. Specifically, the
20 Individual Defendants participated directly or indirectly in the preparation, approval
21 and/or issuance of public disclosures specified above that contained untrue statements of
22 material fact and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not
23 misleading. Such scheme was intended to, and did, as alleged herein: (i) deceive the
24 investing public, including Lead Plaintiff and other Class members; (ii) artificially
25 inflate and maintain the market price of ImmunityBio common stock; and (iii) cause
26 Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase or otherwise acquire
27 ImmunityBio common stock at artificially inflated prices.
AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT: Case No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-DEB
Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.533 Page 76
of 81
1 213. As set forth above, the Individual Defendants knew or were reckless in not
2 knowing that such statements, when made, were false or misleading, in that they
3 contained material misrepresentations or otherwise failed to disclose material facts
4 necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
5 which they were made, not misleading.
6 214. ImmunityBio is liable for the acts of its executives, directors, officers, and
7 agents, including the Individual Defendants, at common law and under the doctrine of
8 respondeat superior because all the wrongful acts and omissions complained of herein
9 were carried out within the scope of such person’s employment. The scienter of
10 ImmunityBio’s executives, directors, officers, and agents, including the Individual
11 Defendants, is similarly imputed to ImmunityBio under established agency principles.
12 215. As a result of the foregoing, the market price of ImmunityBio’s common
13 stock was artificially inflated during the Class Period. Lead Plaintiff and other members
14 of the Class relied on the integrity of the market price for ImmunityBio common stock
15 during the Class Period and paid prices for such securities that were artificially inflated
16 as a result of the false and misleading statements described herein. Lead Plaintiff and
17 members of the Class would not have purchased such securities at the prices they paid,
18 or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices of such securities was artificially
19 inflated by Defendants’ false and misleading statements.
20 216. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, Lead
21 Plaintiff and the other members of the Class have suffered damages in connection with
22 their purchases of ImmunityBio common stock during the Class Period.
23 217. By reason of the foregoing, Defendants are liable to Lead Plaintiff and
24 members of the Class for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-
25 5 promulgated thereunder.

COUNT II
(Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
2 Against Defendants the Individual Defendants)
3 218. Lead Plaintiff repeats and realleges every allegation pleaded above as if
4 fully set forth herein.
5 219. This Count is brought against the Individual Defendants under Section
6 20(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).
7 220. As alleged above, Defendants, and each of them, violated Section 10(b) of
8 the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making materially
9 false and misleading statements and omitted material information in connection with the
10 purchase and sale of the Company’s common stock and by participating in a fraudulent
11 scheme and course of business or conduct throughout the Class Period.
12 221. Throughout the Class Period, the Individual Defendants had direct and
13 supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of ImmunityBio and, therefore,
14 are presumed to have had the power to control or influence the particular transactions
15 giving rise to the securities violations alleged herein, and exercised the same.
16 222. As officers and/or directors of a publicly owned company, the Individual
17 Defendants also had a duty to disseminate accurate and truthful information with respect
18 to ImmunityBio’s business, operations, financial condition, and prospects. In this
19 capacity, the Individual Defendants were provided with or had unlimited access to
20 copies of the Company’s reports, press releases, public filings, and other statements
21 alleged by Lead Plaintiff to be false or misleading prior to and/or shortly after these
22 statements were issued and had the ability to prevent the issuance of the statements or
23 cause the statements to be corrected.
24 223. Thus, by virtue of their positions as senior officers and/or directors of
25 ImmunityBio, the Individual Defendants had the power to influence and control, and did
26 influence and control, directly or indirectly, the decision-making of the Company,
27 including the content and dissemination of the false and misleading statements alleged
28 herein to give rise to the primary violations alleged herein. Indeed, the Individual

Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document 37 Filed 11/17/23 PageID.535 Page 78
of 81
1 Defendants exercised their power and authority to cause ImmunityBio to engage in the
2 wrongful acts alleged herein or personally participate in the unlawful conduct alleged.
3 224. By reason of the foregoing, the Individual Defendants are liable to Lead
4 Plaintiff and members of the Class for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
6 WHEREFORE, Lead Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants as follows:
7 A. Declaring that this action may be maintained as a class action under Rule
8 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and certifying Lead Plaintiff as the class
9 representative;
10 B. Awarding compensatory damages in favor of Lead Plaintiff and the other
11 members of the Class against all Defendants, jointly and severally, for all damages
12 sustained as a result of Defendants’ wrongdoing, in an amount to be proven at trial,
13 including interest thereon;
14 C. Awarding Lead Plaintiff and the Class their reasonable costs and expenses
15 incurred in connection with this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs
16 incurred by consulting and testifying experts; and
17 D. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
18 JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Lead Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
