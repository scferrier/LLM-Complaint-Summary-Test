Co-Lead Plaintiffs Dominik Dumancic and Luis Vicente Davidoff Cracasso (“Co-
Lead Plaintiffs”) and additional plaintiff Richard Wilkinson (together with Co-Lead Plaintiffs,
“Plaintiffs”), bring this action pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a) (“Section 10(b)” and
“Section 20(a),” respectively) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and
17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5 (“Rule 10b-5”) promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), individually and on behalf of themselves and all persons
similarly situated who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of American Airlines Group
Inc. (“American” or the “Company”) between July 20, 2023 and May 28, 2024, inclusive (the
“Class Period”).2
Plaintiffs allege the following based upon personal knowledge as to themselves
and their own acts, and upon information and belief as to all other matters. Plaintiffs’
information and belief is based on the investigation of their undersigned attorneys (“Lead
Counsel”), which included, among other things, review and analysis of: (i) public documents,
public filings, and wire and press releases published by and regarding American; (ii) Defendants’
other public statements, including transcripts of interviews Defendants participated in as
transcribed by third party news aggregators (including S&P Global, FactSet, and Seeking
Alpha), and recordings of such interviews; (iii) interviews with individuals who are former
employees of American; (iv) reports of securities and financial analysts, news articles, and other
commentary and analysis concerning the Company and the industry in which they operate; and
2 Excluded from the Class are: (i) all Defendants named herein (defined at ¶ 29, infra); (ii)
members of the Individual Defendants’ (defined at ¶29, infra) immediate families; (iii)
subsidiaries and affiliates of American; (iv) any person who is or was an officer or director of
American during the Class Period; (v) any entity in which any defendant has a controlling
interest; and (vi) the legal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns of any such excluded
person or entity. All emphasis is added and all internal citations omitted unless otherwise noted.
(v) pertinent court filings. Plaintiffs believe that further substantial evidentiary support will exist
for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery. Most of the facts
supporting the allegations contained herein are known only to the Defendants or are exclusively
within their control.
I. NATURE OF THE ACTION
Plaintiffs bring this securities class action alleging that throughout the Class
Period, Defendants knowingly and materially misrepresented the success of changes to
American’s sales distribution strategy to investors.
American is one of the United States’ three largest providers of air transportation
for passengers and cargo. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment,
competing for passenger airfare against the other two largest providers of airfare—United
Airlines and Delta—as well as with low-cost carriers and ultra low-cost carriers, such as
Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines, respectively.
Prior to the Class Period, American traditionally sold airfare and ancillary
services to corporate customers through third party distributors who used global distributions
systems (“GDSs”), centralized platforms that act as middlemen between travel agencies and
airlines. These GDSs relied on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and
Transport (“EDIFACT”), a universal language for data sharing, to exchange information
regarding airfare and ancillary services. This traditional method for distributing airfare and
ancillary services is referred to herein as “EDIFACT channels.”
Beginning in December 2022 and continuing through Spring of 2024, American
made a series of changes to the way it sold airfare and ancillary services to its corporate
customers. The Company’s new distribution strategy, coined “Modern Retailing,” aimed to push
corporate customers away from booking through EDIFACT channels to booking directly through
American’s website, mobile app, or a direct connection with the airline, all of which involved
using New Distribution Capability (“NDC”) technology. In theory, changing ticket distribution
to an NDC standard could reduce costs paid to GDSs and travel agencies while providing
American with more control of the price and presentation of its airfare to its customers.
To induce customers to shift to NDC and direct bookings, in April 2023,
American removed forty percent of its airfare content from EDIFACT channels and restricted its
availability to the Company’s direct and NDC channels. American also implemented changes to
booking agreements with travel agencies and corporations who were booking their own travel
(either through an in-house corporate travel department, a travel management company
(“TMC”), or a travel agency) by reducing the number of incentives those customers previously
received for buying American services through EDIFACT channels, in favor of awarding
incentives tied to bookings made directly with American or through NDC-enabled channels.
From July 2023 through April 2024, Defendants touted the success of their
changes to American’s distribution strategy, and issued false earnings guidance for the second
quarter and full-year 2024 (“2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance”) that reflected the supposed financial
success of their new distribution strategy. Defendants also falsely claimed that they were very
encouraged both by third parties’ response to distribution changes and adoption of NDC
technology, as well as by corporate customers’ continued demand. For example, speaking of
corporate customers, Defendant Raja positively touted “the durability of these customers’
demand” and Defendant Isom stated that “[t]here’s nothing that I see in terms of customer
behavior that would suggest that we’re not on the right path.” Defendants continued to echo
these claims throughout the Class Period.
However, contrary to their public representations, Defendants had no basis for
their portrayal of the results from their new distribution strategy, or for their 2Q/Full Year 2024
guidance because American’s distribution strategy changes were driving travel agencies and
corporate customers away in droves, and American’s share of business among airlines as a whole
was withering. Indeed, confidential witnesses (“CWs”) who were employed by American during
the Class Period recounted that American’s relationships with both travel agencies and corporate
customers quickly deteriorated after the Company began introducing its distribution changes. For
instance, by April 2023, before the Class Period even began, it was clear to CW2 that, as a result
of American’s aggressive push towards NDC distribution, agencies and companies were booking
fewer flights with American than they had in the past, with some avoiding American entirely.
Similarly, CW1 personally “saw share move away swiftly” by TMCs, which predominately cater
to business and corporate travelers. This reduction in share became “particularly noticeable” to
CW1 in June 2023 and continued thereafter. Similarly, CW1 confirmed that American “lost so
much share” of small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) since many were unwilling to stop
using agencies.
Critically, based on data available to them through American’s SalesLink Insights
platform, PRISM reports, and from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”)
(explained more fully below), Defendants knew that customers were not adopting NDC
technology and instead, American was losing market share to competitors. As CW2 explained,
by July 2023 bookings from larger agencies declined 15% compared to year-over-year levels,
and bookings for corporate accounts were “much lower” than that. CW2 elaborated that PRISM
data demonstrated that American’s agency and corporate bookings and percentage of share
metrics remained “consistently down” through the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January
2024.
Moreover, after the Class Period, Defendants admitted to having known that
American’s lagging revenue and “softness in customer bookings” were a direct result of
“changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further
admitted that American knew that these issues existed during the first quarter of 2024 but
nevertheless obscured the severity of impacts in hopes that the results would reverse, stating in
relevant part: “[W]e identified a deviation in terms of our revenue performance versus some of
our large network peers in the first quarter” of 2024.
Despite knowing about these materially negative effects of the new strategy on
their business,, Defendants continued to knowingly misrepresent American’s sales success
throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. Indeed, as late as April 25, 2024 (one month
before quarter close), the Individual Defendants were asked point blank during an earnings call
to describe American’s performance with “managed corporate travel volume” in relation to
competitors who reported market share around “14%, 15%.” Defendants did not demur. Rather,
Defendant Raja clearly lied, stating, in pertinent part, and in contradiction to information known
“in the first quarter,” that such “revenues are coming back very materially for us” including
with regard to “corporate contract and corporate customers[.]” At the same time Defendants
issued knowingly false financial guidance and, referring to American’s supposedly positive
performance with NDC deployment, stated “that’s implicit in our [falsely high] guide for Q2
and for the year.”
Just one month later, on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024, Defendants disclosed
the truth when reporting that Defendant Raja would be leaving the Company in June 2024 and
that American was significantly reducing its guidance for the second quarter of 2024. During the
2024 Bernstein Conference (defined in ¶ 205) on May 29, 2024, Defendant Isom confirmed that
American was reducing its second quarter guidance and revealed that the Company was slashing
its growth estimates for the full year 2024 “due to the changes that we have made to our sales
and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that, with respect to NDC
implementation, American “move[d] faster than we should and we didn’t execute well[,]” “used
a lot of sticks[,]” and that its “approach [was and] is driving customers away from American.”
During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, Defendant Isom also linked Raja’s departure to
American driving customers away with the changes to its agency and corporate strategy.
Upon this news, American’s stock dropped dramatically, falling from a closing
price of $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May 29, 2024 and
resulting in American’s largest single-day drop since June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic
decimated travel demand. As Defendant Isom would later admit during the Company’s July 25,
2024 2Q 2024 Earnings Call (defined in ¶ 219) American’s guidance reduction was directly
related to the Company’s changes to its distribution strategy—not general air travel market
factors. Indeed, American’s competitor, United Airlines, reaffirmed its guidance within minutes
of American’s May 28, 2024 announcement—ostensibly at the ready for American’s disclosure
of the truth.
Analysts reacted swiftly. For instance, in a May 28, 2024 report, Bernstein
analysts were surprised by the extent of American’s guidance reduction, stating in relevant part:
“[a] significant miss driven in part by close in bookings[,]” i.e., bookings that are made close in
time to a flight date (frequently used for corporate fliers), which “puts AAL’s ability to reap the
full value of a robust summer flying season in greater doubt” and further attributed the “close in
booking weakness … to loss of corporate travel share associated with recent distribution strategy
changes (positive read across to DAL/UAL[Delta/United]).” Barclays wrote in a report published
on May 30, 2024 that “a relevant contributor to the revenue weakness[]” was American’s NDC
strategy during the Class Period, noting that American was now “abandoning its ‘modern
retailing approach’ and that the CCO has left.” Barclays further observed “[n]o other airline has
followed this path[,]” that “American’s revenue guidance was very out of kilter with peers,” and
that “the issue was [American’s] guidance not the reality of the travel market.”
Moreover, after the Class Period on July 25, 2024, Defendant Isom disclosed the
full impact of American’s disastrous distribution strategy when reporting American’s operating
results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. There, Defendant Isom disclosed that, as a result of
the Company’s distribution strategy changes, American lost $750 million in revenue during the
first half of 2024, and was expected to experience another $750 million impact to revenue for the
second half of 2024. Isom further admitted that American had ceded market share from agencies
and corporate customers to its competitors during the Class Period and stated that, in an effort to
regain that share, American was reversing the changes to its distribution strategy.
Defendants’ fraud caused investors to purchase American securities at artificially
inflated prices and suffer immense financial harm thereby. Plaintiffs now seek damages
individually and on behalf of the Class.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to §§ 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and § 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the
SEC, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1331 and § 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa.
This Court has jurisdiction over each Defendant named herein because each
Defendant is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render
the exercise of jurisdiction by the District Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play
and substantial justice.
Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and § 27 of the
Exchange Act because many of the false and misleading statements were made in or issued from
this District. American is headquartered in this District, with its principal place of business
located at 1 Skyview Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76155.
III. PARTIES
A. Plaintiffs
Court-appointed Co-Lead Plaintiff Dominik Dumancic (“Dumancic”) was

misleading public statements.
Additional named Plaintiff Richard Wilkinson (“Wilkinson”) was damaged by
purchasing the American securities set forth in his Certification Pursuant to Federal Securities
Laws (ECF No. 49-1), which Wilkinson incorporates by reference herein, at artificially inflated
prices during the Class Period caused by Defendants’ materially false and misleading public
statements.
B. Defendants
American is a public corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business located in Ft. Worth, Texas. American is a
holding company whose business is operated through its principal, wholly owned subsidiaries:
American Airlines, Inc., Envoy Aviation Group Inc., PSA Airlines, Inc. and Piedmont Airlines,
Inc, among others. During the Class Period, the Company’s common stock traded on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “AAL.”
Defendant Robert D. Isom, Jr. (“Isom”) was, at all relevant times, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and a member of American’s Board of Directors
(the “Board”).
Defendant Devon E. May (“May”) was, at all relevant times, the Company’s
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
Defendant Vasu S. Raja (“Raja”) was the Company’s Executive Vice President
and Chief Commercial Officer (“CCO”) between April 2022 and May 28, 2024. Prior to these
roles, Raja served as Senior Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer between June 2020 and
April 2022, and as Senior Vice President of Network Strategy between October 2019 and June
On May 28, 2024, American issued a press release announcing, inter alia, that Raja’s
responsibilities would be immediately assumed by Stephen Johnson, Vice Chair of American’s
Board of Directors and Chief Strategy Officer, and that Raja would be leaving the Company in
June 2024.
Defendants Isom, May, and Raja are referred to herein collectively as the
“Individual Defendants.” The Company and the Individual Defendants are collectively referred
to herein as “Defendants.”
The Individual Defendants, by virtue of their high-level positions at American,
directly participated in the management of American and were directly involved in the day-to-
day operations of American at their highest levels. As such, they were privy to confidential,
proprietary information concerning the Company and its business operations, growth, and
financial condition. As set forth below, the materially misstated information conveyed to the
public was the result of the collective actions of these individuals.
As senior executives at a publicly-held company with securities registered with
the SEC and traded on the Nasdaq, the Individual Defendants each had a duty to disseminate
prompt, accurate, and truthful information with respect to the Company’s business, operations,
financial statements, and internal controls, and to correct any previously issued statements that
were or had become materially misleading or untrue, so that the market price of American’s
publicly traded securities would be based on accurate information. Each Individual Defendant
violated these requirements and obligations during the Class Period.
As a result of their positions of control and authority as senior executives, the
Individual Defendants were able to and did control the content of the public statements issued by
the Company during the Class Period. Each Individual Defendant had the ability to correct the
statements or prevent them from being released into the public sphere. Accordingly, the
Individual Defendants are responsible for the accuracy of the materially false and misleading
public statements detailed in this Complaint.
Further, as a result of their positions of control and authority as senior executives,
the Individual Defendants had access to adverse, undisclosed information about the Company’s
business, operations, financial statements, and internal controls through their access to internal
corporate documents and conversations with other corporate officers and employees. The
Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that these adverse undisclosed facts
rendered the positive representations made by or about the Company materially false and
misleading.
C. Relevant Non-Parties: Confidential Witnesses
CW1 was employed at American from 2019 to January 2024. In CW1’s last six
months at American, CW1’s position was Travel Agency Account Manager. During this time,
CW1 was based out of one of American’s hub cities, and managed accounts for two “very large”
corporate travel agencies.
CW2 was an American employee for over three decades until leaving the
Company on January 31, 2024. During the Class Period, CW2 worked as a Retail Business
Manager within American’s Global Sales division managing small, medium, and large-sized
travel agency accounts located in the Midwestern and Southern Region of the United States.
CW2 reported to Director of Airline Retailing for the United States and Canada, Jerome Riese,
who reported to Director of Airline Retailing, Jay Creech. Creech, in turn, reported to Neil
Geurin, Managing Director of Airline Retailing, who reported to Scott Laurence, who reported
directly to Defendant Raja. CW2 also interacted with Scott Laurence, explaining that while Sales
and Partnerships were distinct organizations within American, Laurence was responsible for
both, and Raja used Laurence as a “mouthpiece” to issue directives. As a Retail Business
Manager, CW2’s daily responsibilities included contacting travel agencies in CW2’s region to
address service issues, including assisting with travelers’ needs, meeting with agencies to ensure
that they were meeting goals that American set for them and to discuss ways to increase
American’s share of business with those agencies, and providing training and presentations to
agencies. CW2 also participated in bi-weekly and quarterly reviews with higher-ups, including
Geurin, to discuss the performance of CW2’s accounts.
IV. SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS
A. American’s Core Business Is Selling Airline Tickets to Passengers Through
Multiple Distribution Channels
Through its subsidiaries, American operates as a major network air carrier
providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo. American treats all of the flight
equipment operated through its principal subsidiary, regional airline subsidiaries, and third-party
regional carriers as one fleet, which the Company deploys through a single route scheduling
system. American also manages its operations under a single business unit that provides air
transportation for passengers and cargo.
American generates the vast majority of its revenue from passenger travel. For
instance, in its financial and operational report for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023 which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 on Form 10-K (the
“FY2023 Form 10-K”), American reported total operating revenues of $52.8 billion in 2023, of
which $48.5 billion corresponded to passenger revenues (i.e., almost 92%). American’s
passenger travel business includes sales relating to airfare and ancillary services, such as seat
upgrades, checked baggage, Wi-Fi access, and premium dining.
American’s “direct” sales channels include the Company’s website, mobile app,
American Airlines reservations, American Airlines Vacations, and American Airlines Ticket
Centers. Through American’s direct channels, which are mostly, if not fully, controlled by the
Company, travelers are direct customers of the airline.
The Company also sells airfare and ancillary services through third-party
distribution channels, including travel agencies, specialized agencies called travel management
companies (“TMCs”), metasearch engines or aggregator services (e.g., Google Flights and
Kayak), and online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Booking Holdings.
When American fares or services are sold to travelers through third-party distribution channels,
such travelers are considered the mutual customers of both American and the third-party
distributor.
TMCs are agencies that primarily cater to business and corporate travelers. At all
relevant times, there were five large TMCs that dominated the corporate travel planning industry
for large companies—American Express Global Business Travel (“AmEx GBT”), BCD Group
N.V., CWT (formerly Carlson Wagonlit Travel), FCM Travel, and Corporate Travel
Management Ltd.—as well as various small-to-mid-sized TMCs, such as Anthony Travel.
GDSs, such as Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport, operate as the intermediary
between third party distributors (i.e., TMCs and agencies) and airlines. GDSs are centralized
platforms for viewing airline schedules, booking airline seats, issuing airline tickets, and
providing other travel-related services. Airlines pay GDSs per transaction as compensation for
listing their fares within the GDSs’ software, with fees typically ranging between two and four
percent of a ticket price (i.e., an average of $4 to $6 per booking). Third party distributors use the
GDSs’ software to offer and sell airfares and ancillary services to travelers.
Approximately $14 billion of the $48.5 billion of revenue that corresponded to
passenger revenues in 2023 (roughly 29%) was booked through “the distribution channel
traditionally used by travel agencies and corporate managed travel programs” (i.e., EDIFACT).
American’s Passenger Travel Consists of Leisure, Business, and Blended
Travel
American’s passenger travel customers include individuals who are flying for
leisure, business, and “blended” (both leisure and business) purposes. Business and blended
travel are most commonly booked as “managed travel,” wherein a business traveler’s employer
either has an in-house corporate travel department and/or contracts with a TMC to book and
manage travel for the employees. Many employers, especially corporations, prefer to manage
travel for their employees because the structure ensures adherence to the employer’s travel
policies and provides duty-of-care protections for traveling employees. By contrast, with
“unmanaged travel,” a company’s employees are free to make their own travel arrangements,
including choosing their preferred carriers, hotels, and car rental agencies, without the use of a
third party to facilitate bookings.
At the beginning of the Class Period, during the Company’s earnings call for the
second quarter of 2023 (“2Q 2023 Earnings Call”) on July 20, 2023, Defendant Raja described
the breakdown of American’s passenger flights as: “a mix of 35% leisure style travel, 35%
blended style travel, 30% [business].”
A portion of American’s fares are sold via “close-in bookings,” which consist of
flight reservations made within a relatively short time frame before the flight’s departure,
typically within 21 days. Many close-in bookings are made for business travelers, whose
employers are more willing to pay for premium fares or services. While the Company does not
report the portion of its revenues derived from close-in bookings, Defendant Isom confirmed on
May 29, 2024 that close-in bookings represented some of the “highest premium customers” that
American serviced.
American’s AAdvantage Program Rewards Customers Through Travel
Perks
American’s AAdvantage frequent flier loyalty program is one of the world’s
largest loyalty programs with over 100 million members. With the Company’s AAdvantage
program, members who fly on American, any oneworld Alliance airline, any of American’s other
airline partners, or who use an American co-branded credit card can earn AAdvantage “miles”
and/or “loyalty points.” Through American’s AAdvantage program, one eligible AAdvantage
mile earns the member one loyalty point.
While AAdvantage members can redeem AAdvantage miles for flights, upgrades,
car rentals, hotel stays, and travel experiences, AAdvantage loyalty points afford members a
certain status level, such as Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro, and Executive Platinum. Each status
level provides certain benefits and perks like complimentary upgrades, free checked bags, and
priority boarding, as well as additional bonus mileage credits depending on status level.
American Historically Contracted with Travel Agencies, TMCs, and
Corporations to Offer Incentives and Benefits For Booking on American
Historically, before a United States travel agency could sell and issue American
airfare and ancillary services to businesses, the agency was required to enter into two
agreements: (1) the Agent Reporting Agreement with Airlines Reporting Corporation (“ARC”), a
company which enables travel agencies to consolidate the management of their relationships
with global air travel suppliers and gives them the ability to issue tickets on flights worldwide;
and (2) the American Airlines Addendum to the Governing Travel Agency Agreements for ARC
Accredited Agents and their affiliates (the “American Addendum”) (collectively with the ARC
Agent Reporting Agreement, the “Governing Travel Agency Agreements”).
The American Addendum enumerated the Company’s policies for issuing
commissions (if any) and certain incentives to travel agencies.
American also offered incentives through contracts with consumer travel
agencies. For instance, in its “Basic Economy Upsell Program” agreement with Expedia,
American agreed to pay Expedia incentive fees for “Upsell Tickets” (i.e., when optional services
and upgrades are added to the ticket).
Similarly, in American’s “Premium Performance Payment” agreement with
Expedia, the Company agreed to pay Expedia a certain amount for meeting certain growth
percentage thresholds in its sale of premium tickets.
Travel agencies also receive incentives from GDS providers, including volume
awards that incentivize bookings through their systems.
Prior to the Class Period, American similarly entered into contracts with corporate
customers to incentivize the corporations to book with American through third party distribution
channels. In these contracts, American historically offered, inter alia, automatic upgrades to
AAdvantage status levels, discounted fares and preferred seats, priority boarding, dedicated
account managers, and access to the Company’s SalesLink Insights and SalesLink Services.
SalesLink Insights is an online tool that provides agencies, TMCs, and corporations with the
ability to view their progress in meeting contract performance terms such as spending and
revenue share, and data relating to ancillary services, savings, and “Flex Funds,” a service giving
third parties access and management over fee waivers. SalesLink Services is a self-service online
portal that American customers can use to make certain service requests, such as changing
unacceptable itineraries or correcting customer names on tickets, and to access real-time
reporting for such requests. CW2 confirmed that with SalesLink Insights, third parties can see
only data pertaining to their own bookings and services, but American can see data for all third
parties that it contracts with, such as all agencies.
Defendant Raja stated on July 20, 2023, that at the peak of the Company’s
corporate contracting prior to its decided shift towards NDC in 2023, up to 35% of all
AAdvantage members with elevated status levels had such statuses due to upgrades given in
corporate contracts, rather than through actually flying and accumulating AAdvantage loyalty
points.
B. NDC Was Developed as an Alternative to EDIFACT, Which the Travel
Industry Relied on to Exchange Booking Data Between Travel Providers and
Travel Purchasers
Traditionally, the travel industry used EDIFACT channels for the third party
distribution of airfare. EDIFACT is a global standard for electronic data sharing that the airline
and travel industries have utilized since the 1980s to exchange information between airlines,
travel agents, and businesses. EDIFACT only allows airlines to share a small portion of
information about airfare and related services. Many modern airline services such as seat
upgrades, extra baggage, extra leg room, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi, à la carte menu
options, and insurance cannot be merchandised through EDIFACT channels.
EDIFACT is heavily reliant on GDSs to take real-time availability from airlines
along with the airlines’ filed fares and build itineraries using market prices. The GDSs then
present that information to the third party distributors (i.e., TMCs and travel agencies) who order
the tickets in the GDS and inform the airlines of the transactions.
In 2012, the global airline industry trade association IATA developed NDC to
transform how airlines distribute and sell flight content. NDC allows airlines to market their
fares and services with photos and detailed descriptions of their services, to continuously adjust
their pricing, provide personalized offers and bundles, and offer ancillary services like seat
upgrades, in-flight meals, Wi-Fi, etc. NDC also establishes a direct data connection for
information to flow between a traveling customer and the airline, which allows airlines to more
directly communicate with travelers and bypass GDS providers, meaning airlines avoid paying
extra fees while taking greater control over their products as compared to distribution through
EDIFACT channels.
As such, NDC represents an opportunity for carriers to make more money,
through continuous pricing and offering a wider array of ancillary services, and to lower costs by
reducing distribution fees charged by the GDSs.
NDC is not a universal system, as each airline builds its own application
programming interface (“API”) through various IT providers and technology partners. Therefore,
to access this information, travel agencies and businesses can book travel using NDC through
either a direct connection, such as an airline’s website or NDC API, or through an indirect
channel, whereby third-party intermediaries, like GDSs and content aggregator companies such
as Travelfusion, TPConnects, or ARC Direct Connect, connect to an airline’s NDC APIs to
access and display airline offers, fares, and ancillary services to travelers.
Thus, for a business to be NDC-compatible requires committing the time and
investments necessary to enable NDC functionality in an industry where many consumers are
accustomed to buying tickets through intermediaries rather than buying directly from airlines.
C. American Attempts to Force Widespread NDC Adoption By Restricting
Access to Forty Percent of Its Booking Content
CW2 explained that starting in late 2022 and continuing past the end of CW2’s
tenure at the end of January 2024, American made a series of changes to its distribution strategy
in order to push companies and travel agencies to use American’s NDC channels to book directly
with American.
Moreover, as CW2 later learned from a meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay Creech
in October of 2023, Defendant Raja wanted to drive NDC adoption so that American could
eventually eliminate third parties, like agencies, entirely from the distribution process. CW2
recalled hearing that Raja felt it was unfair to the Company to have a third party booking
American’s flights, and that instead, Raja felt that American should be able to manage its own
bookings.
As a part of this push, on December 5, 2022, American Airlines sent memoranda
to travel agencies, TMCs, and corporate customers notifying them that they would need to be
connected to American’s NDC technology by April 2023 to ensure access to the Company’s full
range of third-party public channel content. If travel agencies, TMCs, and corporate customers
chose not to connect through American’s NDC channels, then American estimated that the third
parties and corporate customers would lose access to over 40% of fares available to them via
EDIFACT channels, including American’s lowest-priced “basic economy” fares, as well as some
ancillary products. American’s decision to make basic economy fares accessible only through
NDC channels was significant because it also hampered the Company’s ability to attract price-
conscious travelers to compete with so-called ultra low-cost carriers, like Frontier, Spirit, and
Allegiant. Indeed, when American first introduced basic economy fares in 2017, Defendant Isom
explained that the Company was offering these entry-level price points to “help us compete more
effectively with the growing number of ultra-low-cost carriers.”
CW2 confirmed that unless a customer used NDC channels, they would not be
able to purchase American’s basic economy rates, the lowest-priced fares that American offers.
CW2 confirmed that these changes were directed by Defendant Raja.
A March 2023 American and Hickory Global Partners joint presentation, titled
“Modern Retailing with American Airlines” (“2023 Modern Retailing Presentation”) also
confirmed that more than 40% of the fares available via EDIFACT channels would become
exclusively available via NDC channels. The 2023 Modern Retailing Presentation noted that
American was no longer making its lowest priced fares available through EDIFACT channels
and was instead only offering “Everyday Main and Premium cabin fares” through that legacy
channel. American also exclusively offered its Main Plus, Main Select, and Flagship Business
Plus fares through NDC enabled channels and American-owned channels.3
As a result of these changes, in order to purchase American’s exclusive NDC
content, travel agencies and corporate customers would either have to book with American
directly or connect to “[t]hird-party modern retailing (NDC-enabled channels)” (i.e., travel
agencies and booking tools connected to American’s NDC).
According to CW2, American’s NDC-based modern distribution channel, as it
pertained to travel agencies, was referred to within the Company as its “Direct Connect”
platform because travel agencies and corporations were supposed to use it to book directly with
American, rather than rely more heavily on traditional, third-party GDSs and EDIFACT
technology to facilitate bookings.
American aggressively pushed NDC because doing so allowed the Company to
increase their margins by selling more products and services while also reducing the Company’s
distribution costs. American also sought to shift agencies to using NDC because doing so would
cause travelers to interface with the Company more directly for bookings and services, limiting
or cutting third parties out of the distribution process and thereby opening the door for American
3 With Main Plus, customers receive main cabin extra or preferred seats, free additional checked
baggage, and preferred boarding. Similarly, with Main Select, customers receive main cabin
extra or preferred seats, priority privileges (including priority check-in, security, and boarding),
fully refundable fares, and confirmed same-day flight changes. American’s Flagship Business
Plus is a premium service for long-haul flights wherein customers receive Flagship First check-
in, Flagship First dining, Group 1 boarding, and a free third checked bag.
to reduce (if not entirely eliminate) the incentives it paid to travel agencies under contracted
incentive agreements. For instance, American’s March 4, 2024 Investor Day Presentation
depicted the purported benefits, stating:
On April 3, 2023, American removed a substantial portion of its fare inventory
out of the traditional EDIFACT channels, such that many fares and services could only be
booked through NDC channels.
D. American Reduces Corporate and Agency Incentives and Threatens to
Eliminate Even More Perks
American Alienates TMCs, Agencies, and Corporations by Removing
Incentives and Favors for Business Travelers and Instituting Contracts with
Difficult NDC Adoption Goals
In the first half of 2023, as part of its shift in sales distribution strategy, American
reduced incentives and perks that had previously been offered to travel agencies and TMCs and
mandated new contracts for agencies and TMCs that set lofty goals for NDC adoption.
CW1 explained that prior to when American imposed changes on agencies, the
Company and agencies operated as partnerships. Starting in 2023, however, CW1 recalled that
American changed its approach to agencies in favor of dealing directly with travelers.
CW1 stated that American’s relationships with agencies began deteriorating
around January 2023, when American announced the retirement of Alison Taylor, Chief
Customer Officer, and Defendant Raja took over her duties. CW1 stated that, at this time,
American began alienating travel agencies. According to CW1, this included American telling all
agencies (with the exception of AmEx GBT whose contract renewed at a different time) that
their existing contracts would not be renewed, and that all such agencies would have to enter into
a new type of contract with American by June 30, 2023 or else have to wait until the end of the
following quarter to obtain any kind of contract.
Notably, the new contracts that American began offering to large TMCs in 2023
no longer offered strong levels of incentives or special passenger statuses and corresponding
perks, such as “waivers and favors.”
In the Spring of 2023, American’s contracts with third parties came up for
renewal. According to CW2, who worked in Global Sales as a Retail Business Manager,
American told agencies, TMCs, and corporations in Spring of 2023 that they would have to sign
new contracts with the Company by the end of June 2023, effective July, in order to keep
receiving incentives and other benefits from American (the “July 2023 Contracts”). As CW2
explained, the July 2023 Contracts included incentives wherein American would pay money to
agencies, TMCs, and corporations based on how many bookings they made through NDC
channels—for example, 1–1,500 NDC bookings might result in a payment of $X, but over 1,500
NDC bookings would generate a payment of $Y, and so on, all of which was tracked by
American and the third party through the Company’s SalesLink Insights software. Moreover,
CW2 stated that if agencies did not achieve certain market share goals set by American under the
July 2023 Contracts, then American would reduce the discounts available to these customers by
50% or more of what had been given under prior contracts.
CW2 stated that American set several goals for agencies and TMCs through the
July 2023 Contracts, relating to utilization of modern retailing, and bookings and financial
metrics, but in essence, if an agency or TMC did not meet the goals set out in the contract, then
American would not pay any incentive payments for that given quarter.
With these changes in approach to agencies and corporate customers, American
was focused less on selling tickets via TMCs, and instead, circumvented such TMCs in favor of
selling tickets directly to customers via NDC channels.
American Reduces Incentives for Corporations
Similarly, in 2023, American also reduced the amount of incentives that the
Company offered to corporations. Specifically, CW1 explained that in Spring of 2023, American
was reducing and not renewing various perquisites that American had previously made available
for corporations under American’s “executive status” and other customer status levels (e.g.,
platinum and several others). According to CW1, the perquisites that were no longer available
included bulk ticket discounts and concierge keys. American’s concierge keys are considered an
elite status and afford the traveler with numerous perks including dedicated check in-lines, three
complimentary checked bags, access to certain high-end airport lounges, and access to preferred
or main cabin extra seats. CW1 stated, for the first year beginning Spring 2023, American’s goal
was to reduce corporate perquisites to 75-90% of what had been offered previously.
CW1 also recalled that by Fall 2023, American ended its “Flex Funds” program
for corporations (internally referred to as “waivers and favors” within American). Through
American’s “Flex Fund” program, the Company offered fee waivers to corporations to resolve
ticketing errors. For instance, CW1 explained that, through the “Flex Funds” program, corporate
clients could get a new ticket for an employee in the event of an error like the employee’s name
had been spelled incorrectly. CW1 recalled that American gave corporations a deadline by which
to use or lose their remaining Flex Funds, which CW1 believed was October 1, 2023. According
to CW1, American’s 2023 actions resulted in “pissing off” corporations.
American Cancels Contracts with Small and Medium-Sized Businesses to
Restrict Their Ability to Work with Travel Agencies
CW1 stated that the Company in 2023 also flat-out cancelled or did not renew
contracts it had offered to SMBs through agencies. As CW1 explained, in 2018, American saw
an opportunity with SMBs who never previously had a contract with an airline. At that time,
American offered “off-the-shelf contracts” to SMBs through travel agencies wherein the
Company offered SMBs special terms to incentivize SMBs to book with American. Then in
2023, CW1 stated, American cancelled its SMB contracts and instead began offering its new
AAdvantage Business program to SMBs, which enabled SMBs to get perquisites, such as
AAdvantage miles, from AAL. But CW1 explained that a condition to SMBs receiving
perquisites was the SMBs had to book their travel directly with American and could not book
their travel with American through travel agencies. Accordingly, when American stopped
offering SMB contracts in 2023 and instead began offering AAdvantage Business in October
2023, the Company did so in order to drive SMBs to book travel through the Company’s direct
NDC channels.
Indeed, on October 16, 2023, American publicly announced its AAdvantage
Business program, which replaced its Business Extra program. American claimed that the
AAdvantage Business program would allow SMBs who registered for the program to accrue
status quicker by allowing those companies to earn one reward mile for every dollar they spend
on flights and one point per dollar spent toward AAdvantage loyalty status. American further
claimed that such points would be in addition to reward miles and loyalty points flyers earn as an
individual AAdvantage member. However, unlike with its Business Extra program, these points
could only be earned if the travel was purchased through the American Airlines website or app—
i.e., direct booking channels. As American phased out its Business Extra program, it told
businesses that any Business Extra program benefits (such as priority boarding) would end on
January 31, 2024.
Though American did not publicly say as much, AAdvantage Business was part
of the Company’s modern distribution strategy aimed at edging out agencies and TMCs. Indeed,
CW2 confirmed that AAdvantage Business was an attempt by American to cut out agencies
altogether from SMBs’ bookings.
E. American’s Aggressive Commercial Strategy Drives Customers Away
American’s Unfeasible Deadline for NDC Implementation Introduced
Technological Impediments to Booking, Causing Customers to Push Back
Although American was aggressively pushing for NDC implementation to reduce
its distribution costs and increase revenues, many of the travel industry’s key players, including
GDSs, TMCs, and third-party booking technology, were not technologically prepared to
facilitate full NDC implementation.
NDC is not a single integrated system but rather a patchwork of different
technologies, each of which is tailored to a particular carrier. As a result, it created technological
hurdles for each entity trying to access the information. For instance, in a February 9, 2023
article titled, “SAP Concur Warns GDS NDC Connections Might Not Be Active by April AA
Deadline[,]” SAP Concur acknowledged that technological obstacles existed for NDC
implementation, stating in relevant part: “The reality today is that even a flawless API delivered
in April by the GDSs will take time for us and your TMCs to connect” and that SAP Concur
could not “realistically predict how long that will take because the APIs are not yet fully built for
necessities of corporate travel.”
American acknowledged that there would be discrepancies between what features
would be available on its NDC channels, stating on March 27, 2023, “[l]ike any significant
technology transition, some providers will offer more servicing features and functionalities in
their initial releases than others.” Nevertheless, American attempted to couch these shortcomings
as inconsequential, stating in relevant part: “[t]he small number of servicing functionalities that
won’t be available immediately either don’t affect a significant number of transactions or will
become available shortly.” American grossly downplayed the loss of functionality and mammoth
parade of issues that customers would experience as a result of a premature implementation.
CW2 recounted that integrating into American’s modern distribution channel (i.e.,
NDC channels) was not straightforward or economic for companies and agencies, as travel
agencies and companies had to invest time and money into new technology and have a dedicated
IT person from American’s new distribution channel team to facilitate the switch and as a result,
customers had to rethink their strategies for travel.
CW2 provided an example where American’s corporate customer, the Chicago-
based company Aon plc, attempted to switch from using AmEx GBT for booking travel to
American’s modern retailing platform (i.e., NDC channels). According to CW2, in late 2022 or
early 2023, Aon determined that it would take too much work to set up and be able to use the
NDC platform, did not want to spend the resources to do so, and expressed to the Company that
while NDC was urgent for American, it was not urgent for Aon. CW2 added that Aon was not
alone in reaching this conclusion, and that CW2 learned from speaking with peers in the Global
Sales division that nearly everyone had stories similar to Aon’s: corporations were having a hard
time using American’s NDC technology.
For instance, according to CW2, customers were unable to obtain major,
necessary information with American’s NDC channels that were available through EDIFACT
channels, such as “duty-of-care data.” As CW2 explained, corporations have to comply with
duty-of-care requirements for their traveling employees, and need to be informed of risks to
travelers’ safety—for example, if a region is impacted by war, a company needs data
immediately on how many of its employees are traveling in that region– and American’s NDC
technology could not gather the data necessary for companies to comply with their duty-of-care
requirements.
CW2 also stated that certain other services were not available through American’s
NDC channels, such as the ability to communicate to agencies to notify them of changes to flight
schedules. Similarly, as The Wall Street Journal reported in a January 9, 2025 article, travel
managers at corporations lost “important protections and benefits” on American’s modern
distribution channels, such as being able to change names on tickets. As a result, according to
CW2, there was “a lot of pushback” from customers about having to use them.
CW2 explained that, prior to American’s push for customers to book directly
through NDC channels, it was easier to perform services like changing tickets because the travel
agencies were able to make those changes for a customer. However, with NDC, the travel
agencies lost the ability to perform those functions on behalf of corporate travelers. Instead,
American controlled the tickets and all changes had to be made through the host of American’s
NDC platform, Sabre. CW2 explained that corporate customers would contact American and ask
for help in various situations but the only response that CW2 and CW2’s colleagues could offer
was to direct the customer to Sabre.
Corporate Buyers and Travel Agencies Shift Business Away from American
a. TMCs and Agencies Shift Business Travel Away from
American
In early 2023, when American forced TMCs to sign new contracts offering far
fewer incentives for business travelers in an effort to drive NDC adoption, the TMCs responded
by shifting travelers to other airlines instead of American. As CW1 explained, certain agencies
“had more control on share” (i.e., more ability to direct business to or away from particular
airlines), and these agencies would no longer use American anymore. Indeed, CW1 personally
“saw share move away swiftly” by the TMCs. This reduction in share became “particularly
noticeable” to CW1 when American’s “old agency deal expired”—i.e., in June 2023—and
continued thereafter. The decline reflected that American was “just not competitive” anymore.
CW1 attributed part of American’s lack of competitiveness to the Company no longer offering
agencies the perquisites, such as “waivers and favors” or special passenger “statuses” that had
been available in the past. As a result, according to CW1, American’s share of travel agency
business essentially “bottomed out,” including in the Atlanta market, which was especially
important to American.
CW2 explained for example that Anthony Travel, a TMC which handles travel
arrangements for universities, and which had historically brought “a lot of revenue” to American,
ended up pulling back in offering American’s fares to travelers because of the Company’s
changes towards NDC distribution.
b. SMBs and Corporations Shift Their Business Travel Away
from American
When American stopped offering SMB contracts in 2023 and instead began
offering AAdvantage Business to SMBs to book travel through the Company’s direct NDC
channels, SMBs had increased difficulty managing their travel bookings due to lack of control
and information transparency using American’s NDC channels.
For instance, CW1 stated that SMBs had difficulty managing their travel bookings
directly through American as opposed to when using agencies. Specifically, CW1 explained that
booking through travel agencies provided SMBs better visibility into accounting information and
offered superior data to help companies fulfill duty-of-care requirements for their employees,
such as in the event of a natural disaster while employees are traveling. CW1 stated that
companies could access travel data much easier through agencies versus when a company’s
employees book their own travel directly with an airline because the “real-time data” from
airlines “is not great.” CW1 similarly recalled that under the AAdvantage Business program, if a
company’s employee’s flight was cancelled, the SMB or its employee would essentially have to
handle booking a new flight on their own rather than an agency providing this service for them.
As a result, because American’s NDC channels could not offer the same quality
of information to SMBs as travel agencies, and direct bookings like AAdvantage Business were
inconvenient for SMBs and their employees, many SMBs were unwilling to stop using travel
agencies and switch to direct booking through, e.g., AAdvantage Business.
Indeed, CW1 confirmed that, because of the AAdvantage Business, American
“lost so much share” of SMBs’ business since many were unwilling to stop using agencies.
Similarly, as a result of American’s changes, CW2 stated that a lot of companies
and travel agencies determined that using American’s NDC platform was too complicated and
“pull[ed] back” from booking flights with American in favor of airlines like United Airlines that
remained more “user-friendly,[,]” which CW2 stated definitely impacted revenue.
It was clear to CW2 by April 2023 that, as a result of American’s aggressive push
towards NDC distribution, agencies and companies were booking fewer flights with American
than they had in the past, with some avoiding American entirely. CW2 knew this from
discussions with CW2’s agency clients who were having “a really hard time getting up and
running” using American’s NDC channels.
CW2 added that in response to the changes and lack of support from American,
agencies began deprioritizing American flights versus those of competitor airlines when offering
options to travelers, explaining that agencies began causing American’s fares to come up at the
very bottom of the listings for a given flight route. CW2 explained that agencies were pulling
back from using American in June 2023, when new contracts between American and its agencies
and/or business accounts went into effect, and continued thereafter.
American’s changes in favor of NDC distribution also alienated large
corporations, driving them to book their employees’ travel at competitor airlines. CW1 recalled
learning from a colleague that one of American’s customers, the defense firm Lockheed Martin,
had been “so pissed off” by the Company’s changes that Lockheed Martin designated American
as its “least-preferred” vendor for air travel, causing the Company to lose “tons” of share from
the customer. CW1 stated that when American’s changes pissed off travel managers, some went
“out of their way” to book with any airline other than American. Because CW1 departed
American in January 2024, it follows that this must have occurred between the Company
implementing changes to corporate contracts in Spring 2023 and January 2024.
Corroborating CW1’s recollection, The Wall Street Journal reported in a January
9, 2025 article that, in response to American’s distribution changes, Lockheed Martin “retracted
American’s status as a preferred carrier[,]” caused the Company’s flights to appear lower in
search results in Lockheed’s flight booking system, and gave pop-up notifications in the system
to suggest alternatives to American flights, which resulted in Lockheed “slash[ing] its spending
with American—once its most frequently-used carrier—by 30%.”
c. American’s Internal Data Shows Poor NDC Adoption and the Company Losing
Share of the Business Travel Market in 2023 into 2024
Multiple CWs confirmed that, starting in 2023 and continuing into 2024,
American’s internal data demonstrated both that agencies, TMCs, and corporations were not
adopting NDC as quickly or as broadly as the Company demanded, and that American was
losing market share of corporate travel as a result.
CW2 explained that American measured the performance of its agency accounts
through both the Company’s SalesLink Insights platform and through “PRISM” reports.
According to CW2, while each individual agency or TMC could view data pertaining to its own
bookings and services in SalesLink Insights, American employees and management could see
global data pertaining to all third parties on the platform, including granular details per agency or
TMC, and per route in American’s network. Further, CW2 recounted, SalesLink Insights
contained financial results measured by quarter, and indicated whether an agency or TMC
account was “on trend,” so that sales personnel including CW2 could then, for example, talk to
the third party to ask them what could be done to bring up the third party’s bookings in a
particular route.
CW2 stated that SalesLink Insights also allowed American to track metrics such
as how much “share” of agency bookings were going to the Company versus competitor airlines,
and the rates that each agency used American’s NDC distribution channels versus EDIFACT
channels. As CW2 explained, Passenger Share Performance (“PSP”), or simply “share,” was a
key metric that basically indicated how many travelers booked with American versus with
competitor airlines.
Indeed, CW1 and CW2 confirmed that American used PSP to estimate what the
Company believed its market share should be. CW1 also confirmed that PSP was a key metric
for American and explained to calculate PSP, American would estimate what it believed its share
of the market should be using the number of aircraft AAL was operating and the overall Quality
Service Index (“QSI”).
The QSI model is an analytical tool used to, inter alia, plan the Company’s
network, and forecast passenger behavior. Using the QSI model, American would generate a QSI
score, and, coupled with internal data such as the number of aircraft owned by American,
calculate an estimate predicting what American’s share should be for a given month.
CW1 provided an example of how American would evaluate performance using
PSP, stating if American internally determined that its share of travel agency business should be
33%, and determined, based on IATA reports, that the Company achieved 33%, then American’s
PSP score would be 100%. Thus, if American’s PSP was 100%, it follows that the Company
accurately predicted its market share.
During the last six months of CW1’s employment with American, which ended in
January 2024, however, CW1 recalled that American’s PSP never came in above 90%, meaning
that travel agencies were directing corporate bookings to competitor airlines, particularly Delta
and United Airlines. When asked if the loss of corporate travel agency share reflected that
American might have been gaining business by selling directly to consumers, CW1 stated that
American was also coming up short on “top line revenue,” so, in CW1’s view, this must have
been because “corporate buyers” (i.e., the corporate clients of the travel agencies) were “not
circumventing agents” after all.
CW2 also recalled that American used a software called PRISM to track certain
metrics such as American’s share of bookings versus that of competitor airlines by both revenues
and percentage—to gauge how the Company was performing with agencies and corporations—
and whether bookings were made through agencies and TMCs or through NDC—to track NDC
adoption. As CW2 explained, PRISM contained detailed data by month, and finalized data was
available in PRISM roughly one month after the close of a given quarter. CW2 was emailed
reports of PRISM data in a spreadsheet format at least monthly. CW2 explained that CW2 and
other salespersons monitored metrics from SalesLink Insights and PRISM “constantly” because
the metrics determined their quarterly bonuses. Moreover, CW2 confirmed that NDC utilization
rates, in particular, were a key metric for American in 2023 into 2024.
According to CW2, once American pushed the July 2023 Contracts onto agencies,
TMCs, and corporations, bookings and American’s percentage of share for these third parties
went down and stayed down. Specifically, CW2 observed that right after the new contracts were
put into place, bookings from larger agencies declined 15% compared to year-over-year levels,
and bookings for corporate accounts were “much lower” than that. CW2 elaborated that PRISM
data demonstrated that American’s agency and corporate bookings and percentage of share
metrics remained “consistently down” through the end of CW2’s tenure at the Company (which
ended January 2024).
CW2 also stated that it was apparent that agencies and TMCs were not booking
with the Company because American’s ranking as a travel provider to corporations dropped
noticeably. As CW2 detailed, many corporations book their employees’ travel through multiple
airlines, and therefore, airlines were ranked as primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. travel service
providers based on the number of bookings the corporation made with each airline. According to
CW2, once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped from being the primary
or secondary provider and became the secondary or tertiary provider for a “huge number” of
corporations, which indicated that corporations were booking less with American and more with
competitors. By way of example, CW2 recounted that for Aon, American dropped from being
the corporation’s secondary provider to become its tertiary provider.
Moreover, CW2 stated that agencies, TMCs, and corporations were not meeting
American’s goals for booking through NDC as set forth in the July 2023 Contracts, indicating
that they were not adopting booking through NDC channels. CW2 explained that while certain of
American’s accounts like Expedia, Orbitz, and Kayak were doing relatively well because these
companies had started on the Internet and were essentially “built for NDC,” many clients were
not set up for NDC implementation, including AmEx GBT, BDC, and small-to-medium-sized
agencies, which comparatively were not doing well in adopting the NDC channels. Most of
CW2’s agencies and TMCs in 2023 were not making any bookings through NDC at all, which
CW2 discussed with peers in American’s Sales division. CW2 recalled that these sales peers
would ask each other, “how many NDC bookings did you have this week, or this last quarter?”
and each peer that CW2 would speak to would simply respond “none.” “Everything” with the
exception of companies like Expedia, Orbitz, and Kayak “was down” in bookings according to
CW2.
Information regarding American’s dwindling market share and poor NDC
adoption rates was circulated up the corporate chain and discussed among management. For
instance, CW1 stated that Defendant Raja could “see the numbers” for business between
American and agencies by way of reviewing data from reports issued by IATA. As CW1
explained, IATA published monthly reports providing very detailed airline industry data,
including how much share a given agency represented “in any given cabin.” CW1 also stated that
IATA published preliminary results within a few weeks of a month’s close, as well as final
results six weeks following a given month’s close. CW1 explained that IATA partnered with
firms called Direct Data Solutions and ARC to provide reports on each travel agency’s market
share of airline ticket sales.
Accordingly, Defendant Raja could observe metrics breaking down the share of
business bookings between American’s direct/NDC channels versus managed travel by way of
reviewing data from reports issued by IATA.
CW1 also stated that American’s Revenue Management team held a weekly
meeting to review raw data provided by IATA, which included the performance of each TMC by
region. The regions covered included Domestic, Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), Latin America
(“LATAM”), Atlantic Joint-Business, and Pacific Joint-Business. CW1 recalled that these
weekly revenue meetings were attended by American’s Vice President of Revenue Management,
Scott Chandler, as well as then-Managing Director of Commercial and Partner Analysis Tim
Lyon. CW1 stated that it was clear from the IATA data presented at the weekly meetings that
American was losing corporate market share in 2023 and “everyone knew” it. CW1 reiterated
that “we saw share going down” but, in response, American’s leadership said that it was
expected. CW1 added that Defendant Raja’s response was that corporate clients essentially had
no choice but to use American because the Company’s “network” was so extensive.
V. DEFENDANTS MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS
DURING THE CLASS PERIOD
Throughout the Class Period, American’s changes to its distribution and sales
strategy caused travel agencies, TMCs, and corporate customers to migrate their bookings to the
Company’s competitors, eroding American’s market share and decimating revenues. To conceal
these issues from investors, throughout the Class Period, Defendants issued a series of material
misstatements and omitted material facts in American’s public statements. These material
misstatements and omissions created a false impression that: (i) customers were not only
implementing NDC technology but also embracing it; (ii) business demand, particularly amongst
SMBs and managed corporate travel, was strong and would continue to be moving into 2024;
(iii) American had securely held onto its market share; and (iv) revenue production was
encouraging and undergirded by a “strong foundation” so much so that the Company was on
track to hit its financial targets for the 2Q 2024 and full year 2024.
All the statements that Plaintiffs allege are false and/or misleading are bolded and
underlined within this Section (V). All other statements are included for context. Insofar as
Plaintiffs allege in this Section (V) that information provided by CWs supports that the following
statements are false or misleading, Plaintiffs repeat and fully incorporate therein the
corresponding specific allegations derived from the CWs that are set forth above and identified
by paragraph number below.
A. July 20, 2023 Statements in American’s 2Q 2023 Form 10-Q
On July 20, 2023, before the stock market opened for trading that day, American
filed with the SEC a Form 10-Q to report the Company’s financial and operational results for its
second fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 (the “2Q 2023 Form 10-Q”).
The 2Q 2023 Form 10-Q provided, inter alia, summary risk factors that “may
affect [American’s] business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of
our common stock or other securities.” These risk factors contained materially incomplete and
misleading disclosures concerning the Company’s distribution system and framed risks as
merely hypothetical, not actualized. For example, one of the summary risk factors stated that
“[i]f we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party
service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in
revenue or negative public perception about our services.”
The 2Q 2023 Form 10-Q also contained a longer risk factors section under Part II,
Item 1A, describing “risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities.” These risk factors
contained materially incomplete and misleading disclosures concerning the Company’s
“business model,” including “practices and contracts with providers of distribution systems,” and
framed risks to “revenues” and “demand” as merely hypothetical, not actualized:
We have in the past instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our
business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures
include … changes to our practices and contracts with providers of distribution
systems to provide additional content flexibility ….
* * *
We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on,
we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will
be successful in increasing our revenues or offsetting our costs. Additionally,
the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that
could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased
demand.
The 2Q 2023 Form 10-Q also stated that changes to American’s distribution
channel procedures “may affect our relationships with conventional travel agents, travel
management companies, GDSs and OTAs”:
To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution
costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the
functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-
competitive cost structure. . . . These imperatives may affect our relationships
with conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and
OTAs, including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel
management companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties
seek to acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our
technology alternatives. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution
costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material
diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 118-120 above were materially false and
misleading when made because the harms, posed as mere hypotheticals, were actualized:
American’s changes to its distribution system were disastrous for the Company’s relationships
with travel agents, TMCs, and corporations, thereby negatively impacting American’s revenues
and demand for American’s airfare and ancillary services. The material falsity of Defendants’
statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming
that: (i) American’s shift to NDC channels actually reduced its distribution flexibility because,
on Raja’s direction, American eliminated the ability to purchase basic economy rates on
EDIFACT channels, making them exclusively available on NDC channels (¶¶ 64-65); (ii)
corporate customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings
dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The
Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (iii) American’s relationships with
travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that
existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts
on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings
declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-
75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iv) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers
moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives
and other benefits such as special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77, 90-91); (v) smaller agencies
lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any
support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (vi) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution
strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate customers away from the Company
beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); and (vii)
once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped from being primary or
secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100,
110).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.”
B. July 20, 2023 Statements on American’s 2Q 2023 Earnings Call
On July 20, 2023, American held the 2Q 2023 Earnings Call at 8:30 a.m. E.T.,
before the stock market opened for trading that day, to report on the Company’s financial and
operational results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023.
During the question-and-answer portion of the 2Q 2023 Earnings Call, in
response to a Melius Research LLC analyst question regarding “corporate” travel, Defendant
Raja stated: “And indeed, total business revenues have really regained their 2019 composition in
the system. So we remain encouraged on business demand.”
Also on the 2Q 2023 Earnings Call, Michael John Linenberg, an analyst from
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division, asked Defendant Raja for additional details on
“corporate” travel trends. In response, Raja stated that “we’re encouraged by what we see is
really the durability of these customers’ demand”:
Michael John Linenberg
… I guess two questions here. I guess Vasu, just with the rollout of your new
distribution strategy, any early learnings direct versus indirect? I sort of caught
the 2:1 unmanaged versus managed on your corporate piece. I think if we go back
historically, they were probably more evenly divided. So it seems like there’s a bit
of a shift there. Whatever you can tell us, thanks, and then I have a follow-up.
Vasu Raja
Look, first of all, all of our selling and distribution changes are done with a really
simple lens, really to which Robert talked about in his opening remarks. We want
to make it as easy as possible for our best customers to be able to shop by and
self-service their experience with American Airlines.
And everything has been oriented around that. It has indeed been very eye-
opening and has performed probably above what our expectations are.
* * *
And last and maybe most importantly, we’re encouraged by what we see is
really the durability of these customers’ demand. These are customers who
tend to use our network where it’s most unique. They fly more times in a year.
They already have bookings out into the fall. They tend to sell themselves up.
And importantly, they prefer coming to us direct. So we’re currently in taking
roughly 70% to 75% of our revenues going through our direct channels. We
anticipate that will grow. We’re encouraged by this, and we’re actually going to
continue to accelerate the changes. By the end of the year, 100% of what we
sell, customers will be able to service online through our app or our dot-com.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 124-125 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because Defendants could not have been encouraged by business
demand, the durability of their customers’ demand, or by revenues purportedly booked through
direct channels because business travel demand for American was being negatively affected by
the Company’s distribution changes, and third party distribution partners were not adopting NDC
direct channels. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence,
including testimony from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase
tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15%
after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not
available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent
that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89,
93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025
article (see ¶ 88)); (ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early
as January 2023 after the Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed
and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect,
immediately resulted in larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year
levels and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which
Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii)
beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given
that the Company no longer offered certain incentives and other benefits such as special
passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77, 90-91); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise
necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111);
(v) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel
agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and
throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); and (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts
went into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary
or tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.”
C. October 19, 2023 Statements in American’s 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q
On October 19, 2023, American reported its financial and operational results for
its third quarter ended September 30, 2023 by filing a Form 10-Q with the SEC (the “3Q 2023
Form 10-Q”) before the stock market opened for trading that day.
The 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q provided, inter alia, summary risk factors that “may
affect [American’s] business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of
our common stock or other securities.” These risk factors contained materially incomplete and
misleading disclosures concerning the Company’s distribution system and framed risks as
merely hypothetical, not actualized. One of the summary risk factors stated that “[i]f we
encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service
providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or
negative public perception about our services.”
The 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q also contained a longer risk factors section under Part II,
Item 1A. These risk factors contained materially incomplete and misleading disclosures
concerning the Company’s “business model,” including “practices and contracts with providers
of distribution systems,” and framed risks to “revenues” and “demand” as merely hypothetical,
not actualized:
We have in the past instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our
business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures
include … changes to our practices and contracts with providers of distribution
systems to provide additional content flexibility ….
* * *
We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on,
we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will
be successful in increasing our revenues or offsetting our costs. Additionally,
the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that
could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased
demand.
The 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q also contained a risk factor that stated that any inability
of American to manage third-party distribution functionality “could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition”:
To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution
costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the
functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-
competitive cost structure . . . . These imperatives may affect our relationships
with conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and
OTAs, including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel
management companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties
seek to acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our
technology alternatives. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution
costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material
diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 129-131 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because the harms, posed as mere hypotheticals, were actualized:
American’s changes to its distribution system were disastrous for the Company’s relationships
with travel agents, TMCs, and corporations, thereby negatively impacting American’s revenues
and demand for American’s airfare and ancillary services. The material falsity of Defendants’
statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming
that: (i) American’s shift to NDC channels actually reduced its distribution flexibility because,
on Raja’s direction, American eliminated the ability to purchase basic economy rates on
EDIFACT channels, making them exclusively available on NDC channels (¶¶ 64-65); (ii)
corporate customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings
dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The
Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (iii) American’s relationships with
travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that
existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts
on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings
declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-
75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iv) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers
moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives
and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78,
90-97); (v) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and
American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (vi) rather than adopting NDC
technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate
customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶
85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vii) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped
from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous
corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); (viii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew contracts
with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them perquisites unless they booked directly
with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs had difficulty managing their travel
bookings directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share” of its
SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95); and (ix)
contrary to Defendants’ statements suggesting harm to relationships with third parties was a
mere possibility, as CW2 learned during an October 2023 meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay
Creech, Raja directed American’s NDC strategy so that the Company could eventually eliminate
third parties from the distribution process entirely (¶ 62 ).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.”
D. October 19, 2023 Statements on American’s 3Q 2023 Earnings Call
On October 19, 2023, American held an earnings call at 8:30 a.m. E.T., before the
stock market opened for trading that day, to report on the Company’s financial and operational
results for its third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the “3Q 2023 Earnings Call”).
At the start of the 3Q 2023 Earnings Call, American’s then Managing Director of
Investor Relations, Scott Long, instructed investors to refer to risk factors detailed in the 3Q
2023 Form 10-Q. These risk factors contains false or misleading statements, as discussed in
Section V.C, supra (“October 19, 2023 Statements in American’s 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q”).
During his prepared remarks on the 3Q 2023 Earnings Call, Defendant May stated
that “[w]e have seen steady improvement in business travel with encouraging signs from
both managed and unmanaged corporate customers, strong international demand and
historically high premium revenue, both domestically and internationally.”
During the question-and-answer portion of the 3Q 2023 Earnings Call, Andrew
George Didora, an analyst from BofA Securities, Research Division, asked Defendant Raja to
“speak a little more in terms of what you’re seeing on the corporate side, particularly as it relates
to both large and small corporates” and whether Raja had “seen any sort of unexpected share
shifts.” Defendant Raja notably did not answer the question directly, instead discussing the
selling and distribution strategy changes and stating: “We actually performed better year-
over-year among contracted corporations than we had in a number of months prior to it[,]”
and “we’re actually really encouraged by what we’ve seen, encouraged by its revenue
production, and look forward to continuing the momentum.”
During the same call, Conor T. Cunningham, an analyst from Melius Research
LLC, asked Defendants about the Company’s lagging margins as compared to its competitors. In
response, Defendant Isom assured investors, “We feel really confident about how we’re seeing
‘24 especially on a competitive basis against our peers.”
The statements identified in ¶¶ 136-138 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because Defendants were not seeing encouraging signs from managed
corporate customers or confident in American’s 2024 competitive standing against peers. The
material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony
from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase tickets through
American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023
Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently
down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not available through those
channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify
flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of
which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88));
(ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023
after the Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly
imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately
resulted in larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along
with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based
on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii) beginning in June 2023,
TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no
longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special
passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78, 90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise
necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111);
(v) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel
agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and
throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went
into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or
tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the Company
cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them
perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs
had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted in
American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop
using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.”
E. November 1, 2023 Statements at the 2023 Skift Conference
On November 1, 2023, at 9:10 am CT, Defendant Isom presented at the 2023
Skift Aviation Forum (the “2023 Skift Conference”). Host Edward Russell asked Isom during the
2023 Skift Conference how American’s NDC execution was “performing” and about the status
of American’s rollout of “changes in the way you distribute tickets.” In response, the American
CEO stated that he was “really pleased with the start” of that execution and “as I look out into
2024, I feel really comfortable about the platform that we have in place.”
The statements identified in ¶ 141 above were each materially false, misleading
and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading
when made because Defendant Isom had no reasonable basis to be pleased with American’s
NDC implementation or comfortable with American’s NDC platform moving into 2024. The
material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony
from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase tickets through
American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023
Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently
down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not available through those
channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify
flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of
which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88));
(ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023
after the Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly
imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately
resulted in larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along
with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based
on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii) beginning in June 2023,
TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no
longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special
passenger statuses (¶¶ 72–75, 77-78, 90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise
necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111);
(v) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel
agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and
throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went
into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or
tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the Company
cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them
perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs
had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted in
American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop
using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.”
F. January 25, 2024 Statements on American’s FY2023 Earnings Call
On January 25, 2024, American held an earnings call before the stock market
opened for trading that day to report on the Company’s financial and operational results for its
fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “FY2023 Earnings Call”).
At the beginning of the FY2023 Earnings Call, American’s VP, Investor
Relations & Corporate Development, Scott Long, directed investors to review risk factors listed
in the Company’s 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q that had been filed with the SEC on October 19, 2023,
thus incorporating the 10-Q by reference. Several of those risk factors contained false or
misleading statements, as discussed in Section V.C, supra (“October 19, 2023 Statements in
American’s 3Q 2023 Form 10-Q”).
During his prepared remarks on the FY2023 Earnings Call, Defendant Isom
indicated that Defendants were seeing positive trends in business travel, stating “[d]emand
remains strong and we have seen robust bookings to start the year as travel trends have begun to
normalize across entities. We’re also very encouraged by the trends we’re seeing in business
travel.” Isom specifically highlighted that American “continue[d] to see strength among
small- and medium- sized businesses.” Moments later, Isom relatedly stated that “[w]e’re very
encouraged by the results” of changes made to American’s distribution strategy, which he
claimed gave “improved access to our best products and enable[d] American to provide
better customer service to the individual traveler.”
Defendant May provided the Company’s full-year guidance during his prepared
remarks on the FY2023 Earnings Call, stating in relevant part: “This year, we expect to
produce adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $2.25 and $3.25. Using the
midpoint of that guidance, we are forecasting free cash flow production of over $2 billion.”
During the question-and-answer portion of the FY2023 Earnings Call, a Wolfe
Research analyst pressed the Company on its guidance, asking:
So overall, we’ve seen some of the other airlines so far guide to positive [revenue
per available seat mile (“RASM”)] this year. How come you guys are flat to
down on RASM? Any thoughts that explains the difference between what you’re
guiding to and maybe what some of the others are saying?
In response, Defendant Isom attempted to quell concerns around declining
demand, stating in relevant part: “Look, we see obviously tremendous demand.”
During the FY2023 Earnings Call, in response to a question from Jamie Nathaniel
Baker, an analyst from JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division, about how well American
was doing in terms “corporate recovery” to pre-pandemic levels, and whether Defendants “need
to make further adjustments[,]” Defendant Raja stated, with regard to American’s NDC
“distribution strategy,” including specifically “with corporate travel management or travel
agencies” that “[w]e see that we’re producing revenue . . . more to the liking of our
customers.” Defendant Raja further stated that “[a]ll of our financial incentives targeted to
[travel agencies and travel managers] are really around helping them shift. So we’ve
actually been very encouraged by what we’ve seen.”
Andrew George Didora, from BofA Securities, Research Division, also pointedly
asked on the FY2023 Earnings Call “what have been the growing pains thus far with the NDC
rollout?” In response, Defendant Raja sidestepped answering whether there were any issues with
American’s push for NDC distribution, instead stating “we have been similarly enthusiastic
and even a little surprised at how quickly the transition has happened .… We’re really
encouraged by what we’ve seen there.”
The statements identified in ¶¶ 146-147, 149-151 above were each materially
false, misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false
or misleading when made because Defendants had no reasonable basis to be encouraged by
business travel trends, American’s SMBs results, the results related to American’s changes to
travel agency incentives, or American’s transition to NDC, nor was American producing revenue
in a manner more to its customers’ liking or expecting to meet its full-year 2024 guidance. The
material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony
from various CWs confirming that (i) American’s shift to NDC channels actually reduced access
to the Company’s best products, because, on Raja’s direction, American eliminated the ability to
purchase basic economy rates and certain premium content on EDIFACT channels, making them
exclusively available on NDC channels (¶¶ 64-65); (ii) corporate customers did not purchase
tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15%
after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not
available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent
that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89,
93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025
article (see ¶ 88)); (iii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early
as January 2023 after the Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed
and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect,
immediately resulted in larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year
levels and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which
Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iv)
beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given
that the Company no longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and
favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72–75, 77-78, 90-97); (v) smaller agencies lacked the
technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support
(¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (vi) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy
changes drove travel agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in
April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vii) once the July 2023
Contracts went into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the
secondary or tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); (viii) in 2023, the
Company cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer
them perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but
SMBs had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted
in American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to
stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95); and (ix) contrary to Defendants’ statements suggesting that
all of the financial incentives were targeted to help travel agencies and travel managers shift, as
CW2 learned during an October 2023 meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay Creech, Raja directed
American’s NDC strategy so that the Company could eventually eliminate third parties from the
distribution process entirely (¶ 62).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in the 2Q 2024 Press Release and a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the
Company’s modern retailing strategy caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and
other third party intermediaries, which caused American to cede market share “from an agency
and a corporate perspective[,]” “contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[,]” and
resulted in American lowering 2Q 2024 and FY 2024 guidance. Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
Defendants’ false and misleading statements had their intended effect. Indeed,
American’s share price increased $1.43 per share, or more than 10%, from its close at $13.93 per
share on January 24, 2024 to close at $15.36 per share on January 25, 2024.
Analysts also found Defendants’ guidance misstatements and false assurances
regarding business demand during the FY2023 Earnings Call to be indicative of American’s
successful NDC implementation. For instance, in a report published on January 25, 2024, J.P.
Morgan stated that American’s “2024 forecast exceeds our own” and did so without “any heaps
of unreasonable optimism that [the analyst] can identify[.]” J.P. Morgan further elaborated on
American’s distribution changes, stating:
If there’s one thing that we need to highlight, it’s that American’s distribution
strategy does not seem to be hurting them. Recall we spent considerable time last
year highlighting American’s concurrent distancing from one-time corporate
partners (or, American’s “scorched earth policy” according to several disgruntled
travel managers we spoke with across financial services and elsewhere). At this
stage, our concerns have not manifested. To wit, selling expenses are down 8-9%.
Meanwhile, 65% of revenue is coming through Loyalty members, with an
estimated 45% of revenue coming through Loyalty members that are purchasing
premium content, up 3 points yr/yr. That does not suggest wide-scale defections
to Delta and United, in our view, and it’s a topic that has also died down as we’ve
spoken to American’s competitors. To quote American’s call, “we sell our
product through the internet,” and we have limited grounds to quibble with that
statement. What appears increasingly clear to us is that much of the negative
sentiment surrounding American’s one-time perceived lack of free cash flow
continues to exit the stock...and we can’t complain that three competitors have
recently taken up residence alongside our existing Overweight rating.
Then, on January 26, 2024, Seaport Research Partners issued a report, titled “A
compelling glide path to better earnings & FCF [free cash flow]; Upgrading shares[,]” wherein
the analyst highlighted that the Company’s “[s]hares were up 10.3% yesterday and are now up
12% YTD” and pointed to “further upside … on a compelling earnings trajectory and thus
valuation[.]” As a result, Seaport upgraded American Airlines to buy and set a price target of
$23.00. In its report, Seaport also emphasized that “we believe AAL is a guide and beat story in
2024[,]” reiterated the Company’s “AAL guided to a 2024 EPS of $2.25-$3.25 on MSD
growth[,]” and further noted that “NDC … is a source of revenue upside that we’ve previously
quantified at $350- $500MM annually, or more. NDC boils down to ‘better merchandizing,’
which permits more sophisticated revenue management of AAL’s lowest yielding bookings.”
G. February 21, 2024 Statements in American’s FY2023 Form 10-K
On February 21, 2024, American reported its financial and operational results for
its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 by filing a Form 10-K with the SEC
(the “FY2023 Form 10-K”) before the stock market opened for trading that day.
The FY2023 Form 10-K provided, inter alia, summary risk factors that “may
affect [American’s] business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of
our common stock or other securities.” These risk factors contained materially incomplete and
misleading disclosures concerning the Company’s distribution system and framed risks as
merely hypothetical, not actualized. One of the summary risk factors stated that “[i]f we
encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service
providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or
negative public perception about our services.”
American’s FY2023 Form 10-K also contained a longer risk factors section under
Part I, Item 1A that provided various risk factors “that may affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities.”
These risk factors contained materially incomplete and misleading disclosures concerning the
Company’s “business model,” including “practices and contracts with providers of distribution
systems,” and framed risks to “revenues” and “demand” as merely hypothetical, not actualized:
We have in the past instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our
business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures
include … changes to our practices and contracts with providers of distribution
systems to provide additional content flexibility….
* * *
We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on,
we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will
be successful in increasing our revenues or offsetting our costs. Additionally,
the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that
could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased
demand.
Also within the risk factors section, the FY2023 Form 10-K stated :
To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution
costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility, continue to migrate the
distribution of tickets to our proprietary and other modern distribution
channels, and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while
maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure and a high level of customer
satisfaction. Further, as distribution technology changes we will need to continue
to update our technology by acquiring new technology from third parties, building
the functionality ourselves, or a combination, which in any event will likely entail
significant technological and commercial risk and involve potentially material
investments. These imperatives may affect our relationships with
conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and OTAs,
including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel management
companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties seek to
acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our technology
alternatives. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights
and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or
disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 158-160 above were materially false, misleading
and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statement therein not false or misleading
when made because the harms, posed as hypotheticals, were actualized: American’s changes to
its distribution system were disastrous for the Company’s relationships with travel agents,
TMCs, and corporations, thereby negatively impacting American’s revenues and demand for
American’s airfare and ancillary services. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is
supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming that:
(i) American’s shift to NDC channels actually reduced its distribution flexibility because, on
Raja’s direction, American eliminated the ability to purchase basic economy rates on EDIFACT
channels, making them exclusively available on NDC channels (¶¶ 64-65); (ii) corporate
customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping
“much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The
Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (iii) American’s relationships with
travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that
existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts
on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings
declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-
75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iv) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers
moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives
and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72–75, 77-78,
90-97); (v) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and
American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (vi) rather than adopting NDC
technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate
customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶
85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vii) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped
from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous
corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); (viii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew contracts

bookings directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share” of its
SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95); and (ix)
contrary to Defendants’ statements suggesting harm to relationships with third parties was a
mere possibility, as CW2 learned during an October 2023 meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay
Creech, Raja directed American’s NDC strategy so that the Company could eventually eliminate
third parties from the distribution process entirely (¶ 62).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters.” Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
H. March 12, 2024 Statements at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference
On March 12, 2024, Defendants Isom and May spoke at the 2024 J.P. Morgan
Industrials Conference (the “2024 JP Morgan Conference”). During the 2024 JP Morgan
Conference, Defendant Isom reaffirmed the Company’s full-year guidance, and misattributed
that decision to American’s purportedly “strong” demand performance, stating in relevant part:
“[W]e feel really comfortable about demand. Demand is strong” and “we still anticipate
producing $2 billion of free cash flow[.]”
During the question-and-answer portion of the 2024 JP Morgan Conference,
Defendant Isom stated that he felt “really good about how [American has] been able to hang
on to our [market] share” despite the push into NDC distribution:
Mark Stephen Streeter
So one thing Jamie and I are intensely focused on is your push into new
distribution channels and what you’ve done with your corporate sales force,
which you’ve downsized it more so than your competitors. And so, how is that --
you referred to it a little bit at the Investor Day. We talked about it on the
quarterly -- our quarterly wrap up as well because it looks like so far, so good. We
can’t necessarily see anything in your numbers that show that -- but we’re hearing
from others that there may be some share shift. Obviously, I think the corporate
travel world is all up in arms about what you’re doing and pushing the ball
forward. So, just maybe you can talk a little bit about your experience with
pursuing those new distribution channels and the strategy behind what you’re
doing with the corporate sales force.
Robert D. Isom
And I’m really proud of us being aggressive and taking some bold moves. It’s not
without risk, obviously. But there is -- I’m very pleased with where we stand
right now. There’s nothing that I see in terms of customer behavior that
would suggest that we’re not on the right path.… And while you may have
seen some changes to our sales force, I feel really good about what I see in terms
of cost of sale, and I also feel really good about how we’ve been able to hang
on to our share as well. So as we go forward, everybody -- we want everybody
to come with us. And whether it’s the GDSs or whether it’s the TMCs, there’s a
place at American where we can all do well, but it takes investment in technology.
And it’s where the marketplace is going to go anyway. Customers are going to
demand being able to service and to shop with how they do everywhere else. And
so as we push forward here, I see our customers, I see our partners all
engaging in a way that’s beneficial for us and ultimately, American Airlines.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 163-164 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because Defendants lacked a reasonable basis to be pleased with
American’s competitive standing, to claim they had seen nothing in their customers’ behavior
suggesting they were not on the right path, or to be feeling “really good” about the Company’s
ability to hold onto market share, given Defendants were already seeing negative reactions and
changes in their customers’ behavior evidencing that American was not on the right path and its
distribution strategy was then driving customers away, which Defendant Isom later admitted on
May 29, 2024 had already negatively impacted American’s market share and revenue. The
material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony
from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase tickets through
American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023
Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently
down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not available through those
channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify
flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of
which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88));
(ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023

TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no
longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special
passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78, 90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise

cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them
perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs
had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted in
American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop
using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in the 2Q 2024 Press Release and a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the
Company’s modern retailing strategy caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and
other third party intermediaries, which caused American to cede market share “from an agency
and a corporate perspective[,]” “contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[,]” and
resulted in American lowering 2Q 2024 and FY 2024 guidance. Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
I. April 10, 2024 Statements at the Elevate + TravelConnect Conference
On April 10, 2024, Defendant Raja spoke at the Elevate + TravelConnect
Conference (the “2024 Elevate + TravelConnect Conference”). During his presentation, Raja
stated that American was “trying to make [the] transition to NDC as riskless as possible” for
travel agencies, and that he was “encouraged about where some of that is going”:
And we, as all of us, we need to evolve to a world where we give the customers
what they want. It’s easy by American Airlines and the tools and technology of
NDC make that more possible. . . . [A]nd one thing that we’re actively involved
in for any of our retailing partners here or elsewhere, is helping the travel
industry transition to it.
We are key almost, in fact, all of our agency related initiatives are about trying
to make the transition to NDC as riskless as possible for them, and as
beneficial as possible for our joint customers. Because we know that there’s
customers who want to go shop at an agency. We want customers to be able to
shop at an agency, but we try to equip with them with as many financial
incentives as possible. We’re actually really encouraged about where some of
that is going. And contrary to what may get reported publicly, I think there's
a lot of agencies, a lot more than meet the eye, who are very front footed
about doing what's right for customers and really embracing what the internet
can mean as a retailing tool.
During the 2024 Elevate + TravelConnect Conference, Defendant Raja also
emphasized that the Company was earnestly partnering with travel agencies to adopt NDC
distribution:
… And then the third thing, which may be closest to the people here is what we
call our retailing partnerships, which is corporate travel manager, managed
corporate accounts, travel agencies, even ATPCO or ARC, anybody who
facilitates this travel ecosystem where more customers can go and access it and
access the kind of experience that Alex had. Let’s give the end customer the best
that the contemporary tools and digital technology can go and offer. And so we’re
really keen on using all of those partnerships to grow together because, and
we mean partnership as partnership. When we do that all together, we all get
a benefit and I think frankly it’s happening right now, and we’ll probably see
a lot more of this after May 1, which is as more travel agencies go and embrace
NDC and are driving more volumes through it. Not only are they getting more in
incentive payment from American Airlines, they are having a better customer
outcome, and frankly, they’re creating a more competitive business for
themselves. And some of the ones that are succeeding the most are in some
cases, small and mid-sized businesses, not large, publicly-traded travel
management companies. So anyways, I’ll just say more to come on all of it, but
so much of where we go in the future is both good for our partners and enabled by
our partners.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 167-168 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because American was not helping the travel industry transition to NDC,
the agency related changes were not trying to make the NDC transition riskless to travel
agencies, and SMBs were not successfully transitioning to NDC. Defendants also lacked basis to
be encouraged by agencies’ transition to NDC. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is
supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming that: (i)
corporate customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings
dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The

85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped
from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous
corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); (vii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew contracts
with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them perquisites unless they booked directly
with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs had difficulty managing their travel
bookings directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share” of its
SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95); and (viii)
contrary to Defendants’ statements suggesting agency related initiatives were trying to make the
transition as riskless as possible or that American was using its partnerships to grow together
with agencies and third party distributors, as CW2 learned during an October 2023 meeting with
Neil Geurin and Jay Creech, Raja directed American’s NDC strategy so that the Company could
eventually eliminate third parties from the distribution process entirely (¶¶ 62).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[.]” Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
J. April 23, 2024 Statements to Travel Media
On April 23, 2024, American issued a statement via email to several travel
industry media outlets, claiming there had been “great response from agencies” in adopting
NDC:
Customers are at the center of what we do. American is evolving to give our
customers the travel management experience they have come to expect, and
we’ve invited the industry to come along with us. We’ve seen a great response
from agencies increasingly adopting modern retailing technology and many
have already achieved preferred retailer status. The majority of our indirect
bookings are now made via an agency with NDC capabilities, and the current list
of agencies beyond 30% NDC bookings is already impressive. We anticipate
even more who are on the cusp of meeting the threshold to do so very soon,
which will provide customers with excellent preferred agency options to go along
with our offerings on aa.com. As such, we’ve decided to extend the update to the
way customers earn AAdvantage miles and Loyalty Points on flights to July 11.
This extension gives an opportunity for those agencies to complete the transition.
We’ll continue to work closely with travel agencies to support them through
this transition for our mutual customers.
The statements identified in ¶ 171 above were each materially false, misleading
and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading
when made because Defendants were not seeing agencies increasingly adopting NDC. American
was also not supporting travel agencies transition mutual customers to NDC. The material falsity
of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various
CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC
channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went
into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—
because certain other services and information was not available through those channels, such as
“duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or
change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later
corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (ii) American’s
relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the
Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed
the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in
larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on
data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii) beginning in June 2023,
TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no
longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special
passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78, 90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise
necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111);
(v) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel
agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and
throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went
into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or
tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the Company
cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them
perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs
had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted in
American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop
using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[.]” Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
K. April 25, 2024 Statements in American’s 1Q 2024 Press Release and Investor
Relations Update
On April 25, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. E.T., American issued a press release reporting the
Company’s financial and operational results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the
“1Q 2024 Press Release”). The same day, American filed an identical copy of the press release
as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed with the SEC, which was signed by Defendant May. In the 1Q
2024 Press Release, the Company reported a “[f]irst-quarter net loss of $312 million, or ($0.48)
per diluted share.”
In the 1Q 2024 Press Release, Defendant Isom was quoted as stating
unequivocally that American would meet its guidance targets in 2024:
“The American Airlines team continues to build a reliable, efficient and resilient
airline,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “While we aren’t satisfied with our
first-quarter financial results, we have a strong foundation in place, and we
remain on track to deliver on our full-year financial targets. Our team is
running a fantastic operation, driving revenue through our commercial initiatives,
efficiently managing costs, and producing free cash flow to further strengthen our
balance sheet.”
The 1Q 2024 Press Release included the following “[g]uidance and investor
update[:]”
Based on present demand trends and the current fuel price forecast and
excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its second-quarter
2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $1.15 and $1.45. The
company continues to expect its full-year adjusted earnings per diluted
share to be between $2.25 and $3.25.
The 1Q 2024 Press Release also directed investors “to the company’s investor
update, furnished with this press release with the SEC on Form 8-K” “[f]or additional financial
forecasting detail[.]” Indeed, as referenced in the 1Q 2024 Press Release, the Company filed an
“Investor Relations Update” (the “1Q 2024 IR Update”) as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed with
the SEC on April 25, 2024.
The 1Q 2024 IR Update provided the following additional guidance: (i)
“TRASM - Second-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is expected to be
down approximately 1% to 3% versus the second quarter of 2023[;]” (ii) “Adjusted
operating margin - Based on current assumptions, the Company expects an adjusted
operating margin of approximately 9.5% to 11.5% for the second quarter[;]” (iii) “Adjusted
EPS - Based on the assumptions outlined above, the Company expects its second-quarter
adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $1.15 and $1.45 based on an expected
share count of 722.5 million shares. Based on current assumptions, the Company reaffirms
its full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance of between $2.25 and $3.25 using
a share count of 723.6 million shares[;]” and (iv) “Free cash flow – “Based on current
assumptions, the Company reaffirms its full-year free cash flow guidance of approximately
$2 billion.”
Both the 1Q 2024 Press Release and 1Q 2024 IR Update also directed investors to
refer to risks factors described in American’s Form 10-Q reporting financial and operational
results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the “1Q 2024 Form 10-Q”), thus incorporating
the 10-Q filing by reference. Several of the risk factors contained false or misleading statements,
as discussed in Section V.L, infra (“April 25, 2024 Statements in American’s 1Q 2024 Form 10-
Q”).
The statements identified in ¶¶ 175-176, 178 above was materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statement not false or misleading
when made because American did not have a strong foundation in place given the Company’s
distribution strategy was then-driving customers away, which Defendant Isom would later admit
on May 29, 2024, and as a result, American was not on track to deliver on its second quarter
2024 or full-year financial targets. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by
ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers
did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much
lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of
share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and
information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit
of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate
travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The Wall Street
Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies
began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that existing agency
contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies,
which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings declining
15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining
“consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-
106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers moved to
American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives and other
benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78, 90-97);
(iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and American
failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (v) rather than adopting NDC technology,
American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate customers away
from the Company beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91,
96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped from being
primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous corporations
(¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew contracts with
SMBs through agencies and would not offer them perquisites unless they booked directly with
American rather than through agencies, but SMBs had difficulty managing their travel bookings
directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’
business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in the 2Q 2024 Press Release and a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the
Company’s modern retailing strategy caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and
other third party intermediaries, which caused American to cede market share “from an agency
and a corporate perspective[,]” “contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[,]” and
resulted in American lowering 2Q 2024 and FY 2024 guidance. Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
L. April 25, 2024 Statements in American’s 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q
In addition to issuing a press release on April 25, 2024, American also reported its
financial and operational results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024 by filing a Form 10-Q
with the SEC (the “1Q 2024 Form 10-Q”) before the stock market opened for trading that day.
The 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q provided, inter alia, summary risk factors that “may
affect [American’s] business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of
our common stock or other securities.” These risk factors contained materially incomplete and
misleading disclosures concerning the Company’s distribution system and framed risks as
merely hypothetical, not actualized. One of the summary risk factors stated that “[i]f we
encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service
providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or
negative public perception about our services.”
The 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q also contained a longer risk factors section under Part II,
Item 1A. These risk factors contained materially incomplete and misleading disclosures and
stated that:
We have in the past instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our
business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures
include … changes to our practices and contracts with providers of distribution
systems to provide additional content flexibility….
* * *
We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on,
we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will
be successful in increasing our revenues or offsetting our costs. Additionally,
the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that
could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased
demand.
Also within the risk factors section, the 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q stated that
American’s “inability to manage … third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality
… could have a material adverse effect on [American’s] business”:
To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution
costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility, continue to migrate the
distribution of tickets to our proprietary and other modern distribution
channels, and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while
maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure and a high level of customer
satisfaction. Further, as distribution technology changes we will need to continue
to update our technology by acquiring new technology from third parties, building
the functionality ourselves, or a combination, which in any event will likely entail
significant technological and commercial risk and involve potentially material
investments. These imperatives may affect our relationships with
conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and OTAs,
including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel management
companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties seek to
acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our technology
alternatives. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights
and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or
disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The statements identified in ¶¶ 183-185 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because the harms, posed as hypotheticals, were actualized: American’s
changes to its distribution system were disastrous for the Company’s relationships with travel
agents, TMCs, and corporations, thereby negatively impacting American’s revenues demand for
American’s airfare and ancillary services. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is
supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming that:
(i) American’s shift to NDC channels actually reduced its distribution flexibility because, on
Raja’s direction, American eliminated the ability to purchase basic economy rates on EDIFACT
channels, making them exclusively available on NDC channels (¶¶ 64-65); (ii) corporate
customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping
“much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The
Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (iii) American’s relationships with
travel agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that
existing agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts
on agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings
declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-
75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iv) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers
moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives
and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78,
90-97); (v) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and
American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (vi) rather than adopting NDC
technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate
customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶
85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vii) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped
from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous
corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); (viii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew contracts
with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them perquisites unless they booked directly
with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs had difficulty managing their travel
bookings directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share” of its
SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95); and (ix)
contrary to Defendants’ statements suggesting harm to relationships with third parties was a
mere possibility, as CW2 learned during an October 2023 meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay
Creech, Raja directed American’s NDC strategy so that the Company could eventually eliminate
third parties from the distribution process entirely (¶ 62).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the Company’s modern retailing strategy
caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and other third party intermediaries, which
caused American to cede market share “from an agency and a corporate perspective” and
“contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[.]” Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
M. April 25, 2024 Statements on CNBC’s Squawk Box
On April 25, 2024 at 7:30 a.m. E.T., Defendant Isom was interviewed by Phil
LeBeau on CNBC’s Squawk Box television program to discuss American’s financial results for
its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the “April 2024 CNBC Interview”). During the
April 2024 CNBC Interview, Isom affirmed that American would hit its financial guidance
metrics for the second fiscal quarter:
Phil LeBeau
Wider than expected loss. People look at the first quarter, but then they looked at
the full year. You’re reaffirming your guidance. You knew the first quarter would
be rough. What do you think when you look out into the summer and then in the
fall?
Robert Isom
[A]s I take a look out to the remainder of the year, though, we’re in much better
position, I think, in terms of dynamics in the industry and capacity. And so we’re
going to be report-- projecting a strong second quarter and a full year that
hits our original guidance.”
During the April 2024 CNBC Interview, the host also asked Defendant Isom how
American was performing with corporate travel bookings. In response, Isom stated “as I take a
look out into the summer and the remainder of the year, demand is strong across the board.
Small businesses especially, that has really fueled American over the last, since the pandemic.
Corporate travel is coming back as well. And I’m really pleased with what I see going
forward.”
The statements identified in ¶¶ 188-189 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because Defendant Isom had no reasonable basis to be pleased with what
he was seeing with corporate and small business travel or to assert that he was seeing strong
demand across the board. Instead, as Defendant Isom later admitted on May 29, 2024, the
Company’s distribution changes were then-driving customers away. As a result, American was
not projecting strong second quarter or full year results that would hit the Company’s original
guidance. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is supported by ample evidence,
including testimony from various CWs confirming that: (i) corporate customers did not purchase
tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings dropping “much lower” than 15%
after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other services and information was not
available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data” and the benefit of a dedicated agent
that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89,
93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025
article (see ¶ 88)); (ii) American’s relationships with travel agencies began deteriorating as early
as January 2023 after the Company decided that existing agency contracts would not be renewed
and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, which, when they went into effect,
immediately resulted in larger agency bookings declining 15% compared to year-over-year
levels and, along with percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (which
Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii)
beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers moved to American’s competitors given
that the Company no longer offered certain incentives and other benefits, such as “waivers and
favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78, 90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the
technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and American failed to provide any support
(¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (v) rather than adopting NDC technology, American’s distribution strategy
changes drove travel agencies and corporate customers away from the Company beginning in
April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶ 85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023
Contracts went into effect, American dropped from being primary or secondary provider to the
secondary or tertiary provider for numerous corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the
Company cancelled or did not renew contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer
them perquisites unless they booked directly with American rather than through agencies, but
SMBs had difficulty managing their travel bookings directly through American, which resulted
in American losing “so much share” of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to
stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in the 2Q 2024 Press Release and a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the
Company’s modern retailing strategy caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and
other third party intermediaries, which caused American to cede market share “from an agency
and a corporate perspective[,]” “contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[,]” and
resulted in American lowering 2Q 2024 and FY 2024 guidance. Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
N. April 25, 2024 Statements on American’s 1Q 2024 Earnings Call
On April 25, 2024, American held a call with investors and analysts to report the
Company’s financial and operational results for its first fiscal quarter of 2024 ended March 31,
2024 (the “1Q 2024 Earnings Call”). At the start of the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Scott Long,
American’s VP, Investor Relations & Corporate Development, stated that the call would
statements subject to risks factors contained in American’s 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q, thus
incorporating the 10-Q filing by reference. Several of the risk factors contained false or
misleading statements, as discussed in Section V.L, supra (“April 25, 2024 Statements in
American’s 1Q 2024 Form 10-Q”).
During his prepared remarks on the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Defendant Isom
affirmed that American “remain[ed] on track to deliver [its] full-year EPS guidance, and we
continue to expect to produce approximately $2 billion of free cash flow this year.”
Defendant Isom also claimed that American’s corporate travel business was only improving:
We produced record first quarter revenues of $12.6 billion. Business travel has
continued to recover with particular strength in small and medium-sized
businesses. Additionally, we have seen sequential improvement in the
recovery of managed corporate travel and domestic business revenue growth
outpaced capacity growth in the first quarter.
Also, during his prepared remarks on the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Defendant Isom
expressed to investors his conviction in American’s distribution strategy:
We see meaningful opportunities to improve upon our results, much of which will
be captured as we progress through the year. First, we continue to believe in the
value that our distribution strategy provides to our customers and to
American. Engaging directly with our customers through modern Internet-based
technology is where the industry is headed, and we’re leading the way. That being
said, there are near-term actions we can take to optimize our efforts in
advance of hitting a steady state on this long-term strategic initiative, and
those are underway.
Following Defendant Isom’s prepared remarks on the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call,
Defendant May gave his prepared remarks as CFO, stating American’s guidance for the second
quarter:
We expect second quarter [Total Revenue per seat mile (“TRASM”)] to be
down 1% to 3% versus 2023 with unit revenues inflecting positive year-over-
year in the third quarter…. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel
price forecast, we expect to produce an adjusted operating margin of between
9.5% and 11.5% in the second quarter, and adjusted earnings per diluted
share of between $1.15 and $1.45. . . . We remain on track to deliver full year
adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $2.25 and $3.25, and we
continue to anticipate producing approximately $2 billion of free cash flow in
2024.
During the question-and-answer portion of the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, the first
analyst out of the gate, David Scott Vernon of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC, questioned how
American planned to achieve significantly higher TRASM than the Company projected for 2Q
In response, Defendant Raja expressed that management’s confidence came, in no small
part, from American’s distribution strategy:
David Scott Vernon
So maybe to Vasu or Robert, when you look at the 2Q RASM guide, it’s a little
bit better, I think, than people were expecting but it’s not quite sort of flat and
level with peers. There’s also a pretty big sequential ramp from sort of 1Q into 2Q
when you look at the TRASM number. Can you guys kind of help us understand
kind of what’s embedded underneath that? What’s driving the big sequential
acceleration on top of capacity growth? And maybe why that unit revenue metric
is not performing at the same rate as peers?
Vasu S. Raja
…Q1 marks the end of really a year of transition of our distribution
strategies in which we were really focused on actually creating the right long-
term customer proposition, reducing a lot of the unnecessary expenses that
went along with it. All 3 of those conditions start to change as we go forward,
which is not just us guessing, you actually start to see it.
During the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, analyst Jamie Baker from JPMorgan Chase &
Co. also asked about American’s distribution strategy. In response. Defendant Raja downplayed
the “risk to business revenues” the distribution strategy wrought, and instead boldly claimed that
close to 100% of agency bookings would be made via NDC by the end of 2024:
So, a lot of our transition has been undoing so many things that we’ve done which
were not really creating value for the customer nor creating profit for American
Airlines. And we’ve done that over the course of the last year. We’ve reduced a
lot of it and interestingly as you see it today, if maybe there were a more
junior and maybe less jaundiced version of all of us, Jamie, we would have
thought when we embarked on this thing that it would come at a real risk to
business revenues. But if you just look at what we’ve reported today our
business revenues are growing at a greater rate than capacity. Unmanaged is on
the higher end of that contract and corporates which would presumably be the
most effective, are just slightly on the lower end of that. But we’re doing it at 7%
less in distribution expense. 60% of our customers are our AAdvantage customers
and they produce two-thirds of our revenue.
So what we’ve seen happen is a lot of those customers are actually leaving the
agency and coming to us directly on their own and this is a really important
thing because this is where we are. But where we go is a very different thing and
there’s really three things that we’re focused on as we go and optimize our
distribution strategy. The first is exactly what you pointed out with preferred
agencies and we actually pushed the release really because we were all
pleasantly surprised how many people are taking it. The vast majority of our
agencies are currently in an NDC transition, roughly about the agencies that
constitute about 30% to 40% of our revenue are already doing more than 30% of
their bookings through NDC and are on a path to be in some cases close to a
100 by the end of the year. And there’s even more agencies, a lot of big
agencies who are signing on for it because they realize the customer utility and
having a digital selling and servicing experience. And frankly, they see this as an
opportunity to go compete against other agencies, which is great for customers.
During the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Defendants were also asked about American’s
revenues derived from premium content. Defendant Raja suggested that customer spend on
premium content had increased through the modern distribution system, stating, “But this
growth in premium content is something which is really encouraging to us . . . and maybe if
anything more so through our direct channels.” Defendant Isom added: “that’s a critical
component of our distribution strategy as well.”
Later in the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Bloomberg journalist Mary Schlangenstein
asked how American’s corporate travel volumes were compared to competitors. In response,
Defendant Raja reassured that American’s corporate travel volumes were increasing as well, and
would continue to rise into the second fiscal quarter:
Mary Schlangenstein
Some of your competitors have reported that they saw a managed corporate travel
volume increase in the first quarter of like 14%, 15%. I wanted to see if you can
talk about the same type as a comparable number on that and what it may or may
not say about your push for the direct bookings.
Vasu S. Raja
[M]anaged corporates, contract and corporations are growing a little bit less
than that, but still high -- in the mid- to high single digits. Very importantly,
this is actually the great opportunity that we see because really, over the last
year, we’ve done a number of things to just transition away from a lot of
practices which weren't great for our customers. It didn’t give them cheaper
fares. It didn’t necessarily give them lower costs. It actually created a more
difficult servicing experience. What we’re finding now is that many of those
customers, they want the same thing that everyone else has. We can go deliver it
a whole lot better with all the tools and the technology and the change we’ve
pushed through in the last year. And despite all of that, we see that revenues
are coming back very materially for us. Expenses are down, and we can see
more opportunity to optimize it. And frankly, do better both for our
corporate contract and corporate customers and our unmanaged customers
as well. That’s not sort of guesswork that's out there. We actually see it.
We’re rolling out things right now, and that’s implicit in our guide for Q2
and for the year.
The Bloomberg journalist further honed in on American’s underperformance on
corporate travel versus competitors, asking whether the Company was lagging because of
pushback to American’s modern distribution system. Defendant Isom, in answering,
emphatically denied there being pushback, stating “No, we don’t think that is the case at all[,]”
and “we’ve seen great reception to what we’re doing with . . . small and medium-sized
businesses” which Defendant Raja agreed with, adding: “corporates are coming back.”
The statements identified in ¶¶ 193-200 above were each materially false,
misleading and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading when made because Defendants had no reasonable basis to represent that they were
seeing: (i) continued business travel recovery; (ii) improvement with managed corporate travel;
(iii) customers leaving agencies in favor of booking directly; (iv) the vast majority of agencies
transitioning to NDC or becoming preferred agencies; (v) encouraging growth in premium
content; or (vi) great reception to its distribution strategy from SMBs. Defendants also were not
focused on creating the right long-term customer propositions through the Company’s
distribution strategy and did not believe in the value of American’s distribution strategy, so much
so that the Company was planning to reverse the changes implemented as a part of said strategy.
As a result, American’s business revenues were not growing and the Company did not expect to
meet its guidance for 2Q 2024 or the full-year. The material falsity of Defendants’ statements is
supported by ample evidence, including testimony from various CWs confirming that: (i)
corporate customers did not purchase tickets through American’s NDC channels—with bookings
dropping “much lower” than 15% after the July 2023 Contracts went into effect and, along with
percentage of share metrics, remaining “consistently down” (¶ 109)—because certain other
services and information was not available through those channels, such as “duty-of-care data”
and the benefit of a dedicated agent that could modify flight schedules or change tickets on
behalf of corporate travelers (¶¶ 87-89, 93-95) (the latter of which was later corroborated by The
Wall Street Journal’s January 9, 2025 article (see ¶ 88)); (ii) American’s relationships with travel
agencies began deteriorating as early as January 2023 after the Company decided that existing
agency contracts would not be renewed and uniformly imposed the July 2023 Contracts on
agencies, which, when they went into effect, immediately resulted in larger agency bookings
declining 15% compared to year-over-year levels and, along with percentage of share metrics,
remaining “consistently down” (which Defendants knew based on data available to them) (¶¶ 72-
75, 101-106, 108-109, 111-114); (iii) beginning in June 2023, TMCs and corporate customers
moved to American’s competitors given that the Company no longer offered certain incentives
and other benefits, such as “waivers and favors” and special passenger statuses (¶¶ 72-75, 77-78,
90-97); (iv) smaller agencies lacked the technical expertise necessary to transition to NDC and
American failed to provide any support (¶¶ 85, 92-96, 111); (v) rather than adopting NDC
technology, American’s distribution strategy changes drove travel agencies and corporate
customers away from the Company beginning in April 2023 and throughout the Class Period (¶¶
85-86, 90-91, 96-101); (vi) once the July 2023 Contracts went into effect, American dropped
from being primary or secondary provider to the secondary or tertiary provider for numerous
corporations (¶¶ 98-100, 110); and (vii) in 2023, the Company cancelled or did not renew
contracts with SMBs through agencies and would not offer them perquisites unless they booked
directly with American rather than through agencies, but SMBs had difficulty managing their
travel bookings directly through American, which resulted in American losing “so much share”
of its SMBs’ business, as many SMBs were unwilling to stop using agencies (¶¶ 79, 93-95).
The statements were further false and misleading given Defendants’ admissions
during the May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference, the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, and
as reported in the 2Q 2024 Press Release and a May 29, 2024 Bloomberg article, that the
Company’s modern retailing strategy caused problems for agencies, corporate customers, and
other third party intermediaries, which caused American to cede market share “from an agency
and a corporate perspective[,]” “contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters[,]” and
resulted in American lowering 2Q 2024 and FY 2024 guidance. Defendant Isom further admitted
during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call that Defendants knew at least as early as 1Q 2024 that the
Company’s revenue was performing poorly when compared to peers as a result of its distribution
strategy but, in a reckless gamble, hoped it would “reverse itself.”
VI. DEFENDANTS REVEALED THE TRUTH IN A SET OF DISCLOSURES MADE ON
MAY 28, 2024 AND MAY 29, 2024
A. Defendants’ May 28, 2024 Announcements
On May 28, 2024, after the close of trading, American issued a press release
announcing that “Vasu Raja, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will
depart the airline in June.” The release also explained that Stephen Johnson, Vice Chair of
American’s Board of Directors and Chief Strategy Officer, was assuming Raja’s responsibilities
“effective immediately[.]”
The Company concurrently filed a Form 8-K with the SEC confirming the same
information as the press release, and also revealing updated guidance for American’s second
fiscal quarter of 2022. The Form 8-K, signed by Defendant May, specifically stated that for its
second quarter of 2022, American was: (i) lowering its guidance for adjusted operating margin
by a full percentage point; (ii) lowering its adjusted earnings per share guidance range by 13%
and over 20% at the low and high ends, respectively; (iii) expecting TRASM to decline 100-
400% more than previously guided; and (iv) reducing CASM-ex growth expectations by up to
200%:
B. Defendants’ Presentation at the Bernstein Conference on May 29, 2024
On May 29, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, before the stock market opened for
trading, Bernstein hosted Isom for a presentation at Bernstein’s 40th Annual Strategic Decisions
Conference (the “2024 Bernstein Conference”). During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, Isom
expanded on the announcements made the day prior. Pertinently, Isom confirmed that American
was adjusting its guidance for the second quarter and revealed that the Company was slashing its
growth estimates for the full year 2024, stating that “we now expect … our second quarter
operating margin will be 1 percentage point lower than we originally anticipated” due to factors
including “our performance within that environment[.]” Isom also disclosed that Defendants
“expect[ed] to slow our rate of growth from just over 8% in the first half of the year to
approximately 3.5% in the second half of the year.” Defendants, however, punted on providing
additional detail on the impact to full-year guidance, with Isom stating: “We'll refine our plans
and be able to provide more of an updated view on our full year guidance as we progress and as
we get to the July earnings and as we get to second quarter earnings.”
Nevertheless, Defendant Isom elaborated that “domestic performance has
worsened materially since we provided guidance in April for a few reasons[,]” naming the
Company’s shift towards NDC distribution as a key driver:
First, we’re seeing softness in customer bookings relative to our expectations that
we believe is in part due to the changes that we have made to our sales and
distribution strategy. To address this, we’re evaluating our strategy holistically
and piece by piece. We spent a lot of time listening to our agencies and our
corporate customers, and we’re hearing and we hear their feedback. We’re taking
some immediate actions to respond and adapt, and over the coming weeks, we’ll
be working to ensure that we’re optimizing for our customers and American as we
move forward.
Defendant Isom also confirmed that American was walking back the push to NDC
bookings it had made during the Class Period because such changes materially impacted sales.
Isom specifically linked Defendant Raja’s separation from the Company as part of this reversal
of course, stating, in relevant part:
American is taking action to address our capacity and adjust our distribution
strategy, and we’re going to be very attentive to the marketplace as time goes
forward. We’re adapting our distribution strategy. While we all know that NDC,
modern retailing, internet-based channels for selling our product is the future of
airline distribution. But we move[d] faster than we should have and we didn’t
execute well.
We regret that and the difficulty that it created for our agency and corporate
communities. So we are going to modify our distribution strategy. Specifically,
we need to work closely with our agencies and partners to ensure that the
transition that we’re making is not disruptive to our end customers.
[. . .] [W]e know that our products are more easily understood and valued by
customers when distributed through modern retailing technologies. But instead of
removing content from agencies that are relying on legacy technology, we need to
incent more to enhance and promote NDC. We’ve used a lot of sticks. We’ve got
to put some more carrots in place and make sure that our product is
available wherever customers want to buy it.
Our agency and corporate relationships. We’ve made a lot of changes and we’re
reviewing everything on that front, including how we pay those agencies and how
we solve problems that our mutual customers may have . . . We need to make it
easier to participate in our programs and the easier to do business with
American Airlines. For our end customers, that fly every day, we want to make
sure that no customer that’s out there traveling is made worse off from the
changes that we make. And it’s always been our priority to treat our customers in
-- that they’re flying in our seats as best as we possibly can.
So you’re going to see us make changes. . . . For example, next month, we were
going to differentiate who earned Advantage Miles and who didn’t, based on
where they booked, that’s off. We’re not doing that because it would create
confusion and disruption for our end customer, and we’re going to make sure that
we take care. We’re listening to feedback. We’re learning and adapting. We know
that NDC, modern retailing provides a better experience for the end customer.
And we know that we will get there over time, but we have to go about it
differently. We’re going to make it easier, we’re going to execute better and
we’re going to do a lot more to try to bring people along with us.
To a degree our approach is driving customers away from American, we’re
unequivocally committed to getting those customers back. So there was other
parts to do. So before opening it up, David, further discussion, I’d just like to
address for a minute some of the other news that you’ve seen. So yesterday, we
announced that Vasu Raja will be leaving the company in June. And I’ve known
Vasu for a long time.
He’s admirers, creative thinking, his passion. He’s been an innovator, a disruptor.
He is a good friend, but sometimes we need to reset. And in this case, we do. We
have to be better at executing those long-range plans. We have to be more
attentive to the marketplace. We have to be more detail oriented, and we have to
go forward as a team and really make it easy for American to do business with.
* * *
And right now, that means taking a look at our sales and distribution
strategy and what needs to be done. That work is underway. And I’m really
pleased with the team that we have that's out there taking this to task.
Immediately following Isom’s prepared remarks at the Bernstein Conference, the
Bernstein host analyst questioned Isom regarding whether American’s reduced guidance for the
second quarter was attributable to a broader market trend or Company-specific execution issues.
In response, Defendant Isom admitted that American had “dug [itself] into a hole in the second
quarter” in significant part by pushing NDC sales so aggressively:
David Scott Vernon
I think it is important to help investors understand kind of the state of the market
and how much of this is consumer weakness versus how this is sort of self-
inflicted pain and then we get into some of the strategic stuff. So you mentioned
long term -- the full year guidance that was not noted in the call the update. So
where does that stand. Is that on the table? Off the table?
Robert D. Isom
Look, where we stand right now. We know we’ve dug ourselves a hole in the
second quarter. Our operating earnings are going to be off by a couple of hundred
million dollars. We’ve got a lot of work to do to recoup that. There is absolutely
marketplace dynamics that are involved as well. As I take a look at the work that
we have ahead of us. I believe that second quarter this hold down is partially
related to how we – it’s partially related to the industry dynamics, more capacity
than the demand is out there and softer pricing environment.
The other piece is how we’ve executed in that, and I think that that’s something
that, that we can recover. So, we’ve got work to do. We’ll talk more in second
quarter as we produce those results. We’ve got some work to do on building
back from the hole we’ve created for ourselves.
Further, in response to a question from the Bernstein host analyst, Defendant Isom
admitted during the 2024 Bernstein Conference that American’s sales execution issues
experienced in the second quarter of 2022—including with respect to “close-in” bookings which
are highly correlated with business travel—were a continuation of problems experienced earlier
in the Class Period, all stemming from Defendants’ promotion of NDC channels:
David Scott Vernon
And as we think about that -- the magnitude of the unit revenue missed kind of in
the second quarter from April to here. Things seemingly got a lot worse, right? So
as you think about that step down, was that some of the things we noticed in the
first quarter in terms of managed corporate bookings being a little bit weaker,
accelerating and getting worse? Or like is there any way you can help us
understand how much of it is really just Southwest out there with $39 fares versus
kind of shot ourselves in the foot and that got even worse.
Robert D. Isom
Well, I’d just say this, we should have performed much more in line with our
network peers in the first quarter. And so I know that, that’s an opportunity for
us to recapture. But the marketplace has definitely gotten much more competitive
and sale activity increased considerably after we produced -- we put forward our
guidance and talked about our first quarter results. I don’t know if it’s 50-50, 60-
40.
Okay. But I’d tell you that a portion of this is marketplace. And I think that the
dynamics in the industry get better from a capacity perspective as we move
through the year. And then I think the other large portion is how we’ve
reacted in that marketplace. And the weakness that you've seen in American
is I do believe something that speaks to close-in bookings, the highest
premium customers that, unfortunately, we haven’t made ourselves as
available and easy to work with as we can.
* * *
David Scott Vernon
Yes. And was it sort of yield driven or load factor driven just on year to end
revenue basis[?]
Robert D. Isom
Well, I’d say there is a little bit of both. Well, little bit of both but those customers
that are out there want to fly. And so we’ve seen loads remain very, very strong.
But there’s work that we need to do to make sure that we’re maximizing our
ability to revenue manage off of that demand. And that’s where it comes into
American and our distribution strategy and making sure that we’re taking
full advantage of those that really are booking close-in. And for us, that’s a
priority.
During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, the host analyst asked about why
American had not seen the results it wanted from shifting to NDC distribution. In response, Isom
stated that the Company hadn’t made its fares easily accessible outside of NDC channels, and
that American would need to focus on “rebuilding relationships” with TMCs and corporate
customers:
David Scott Vernon
So let’s talk about the network distribution changes and stuff like that. Obviously,
it seems like from the outset looking in and based on what you just said, you
weren’t getting the results you wanted from the steps you’ve taken. Can you, at a
very high level and briefly summarize the changes that you made? And how long
it’s going to take to undo them.
Robert D. Isom
. . . In terms of the execution side of things. I’ll tell you this, we have to make
sure our product is available for sale in all channels. We’re going to be making
some changes very quick. So I think that, that is something that is immediately
reversible. I believe that in terms of rebuilding relationships, I think our
intermediaries and these are the TMCs and our corporate customers as well. I
think that we’re going to have to get out there and really get on the road and make
sure that we move quickly. That’s going to take a little bit of time.
David Scott Vernon
So that is going to require[] kind of rebuilding that corporate sales team and kind
of getting more feet on the street? Or is it going to be more managed from the
corporate office because I know you guys have made some changes to reduce
expense in that area. That’s supporting the distribution changes, just wondering
like directionally, are we changing that back.
Robert D. Isom
No, what I would tell you is because we could take a little bit of both. And to that
end, I believe that we have the resources to actually manage and to react quickly.
We have to -- for instance, we have to make sure that when we’re putting
new technology out and asking our travel management companies to come
along with it. We need to make sure that we have the technical capability to
help them get there as well. We need to adjust things that I talked about were
fewer sticks and more carrots. We’re not going to be taking away the ability
for any customers to earn mileage. And those are the kind of things that I think
are going to have an impact very quickly and I do believe that getting our
products out and available in all channels is something that we can do very, very
quickly.
In response to a question from the host analyst, Defendant Isom further stated at
the 2024 Bernstein Conference that the Company had revised downward its guidance because
making American’s fares exclusive to NDC channels had made American “difficult to do
business with”:
David Scott Vernon
Okay. So then -- last question on the sort of the near term and then we can talk
some of the bigger picture issues around the industry dynamic. You’ve made the
decision to part ways with [Vasu Raja]. Can you just talk about your goals,
expectations, hopes, what kind of mandate the new person is going to have to
come in. Someone that you want to come in and sort of redesign everything? Is
there somebody wanted to implement what you’ve already -- adjust which you’ve
already [ won ] like how do we think about the mandate that you’re going to be
giving whoever. What’s the kind of person you want to commit to take that job
and what’s the mandate?
Robert D. Isom
Okay. Let me just start with this. First off, our strategy is the company strategy.
Those are my strategies, okay? And so I’ll leave any individuals aside from that.
And I do believe that the strategy that we’re pursuing that we laid out in Investor
Day are the absolutely right ones. Now one of the things that is very clear is
that we’ve driven some customers away. We restricted some customers from
actually [unintelligible] our product. Those are kind of things that we have to
be attentive to. It’s one thing to have a plan and that plan can be the greatest
plan in the world. You can have the best people operating it, but execution is
critical.
* * *
That is something that does take technology. It does take modern retailing tools.
But we can’t be blind to that ultimate goal. We have to make sure we’re reactive
in the short run, and we can never be difficult to do business with.
Defendant Isom at the 2024 Bernstein Conference also confirmed, responding to a
question from the host analyst, that while the Company’s aggressive push towards NDC
distribution had driven away, inter alia, business travelers from American, ironically, this market
segment was particularly opportune for upselling premium fares and services, which the
Company’s peers were now outperforming in:
David Scott Vernon
That’s a great segue into one of the bigger picture topics I want to dig into a little
bit today around sort of premiumization segmentation and what that opportunity
set looks like to you? I sort of view this as the industry capturing some of that
numerous consumer surplus that has been out there as you were just selling kind
of one ticket to everybody one price and not being able to discriminate as much.
When you think about the kind of runway that American has specifically to go
after that relative to peers who are enjoying a better sort of unit revenue
performance as a result of that. What are the yardsticks or the benchmarks we can
look at how much opportunity is for you to actively kind of close that gap.
Robert D. Isom
Yes. Well, just in terms of premium revenue. As I mentioned in my comments
that we have been able to grow front cabin revenues at more or less the pace of
more capacity growth. Clearly, others are doing better than that, okay, and
that should be the expectation for us as well. So that is, first and foremost,
it’s close-in bookings. It’s business travel, and it’s those that we want to do
business with us and buy our premium product.
Defendants’ corrective disclosures in the May 28, 2024 announcements and the
2024 Bernstein conference, including Isom’s admissions that the Company was experiencing
reduced demand “due to the changes that we have made to our sales and distribution
strategy[,]” which was “driv[ing] customers away” from American shocked the market and
directly contradicted Defendants’ Class Period assurances that demand for American’s fares and
services was strong and growing despite the Company’s aggressive push towards NDC
distribution.
Upon this news, American’s stock dropped dramatically, falling from a closing
price of $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May 29, 2024. The
decline of more than 13.5% was the stock’s largest single-day drop since June 2020, when the
COVID-19 pandemic decimated travel demand. Notably, one of American’s competitors, United
Airlines reaffirmed its guidance on the heels of American’s May 28, 2024 announcement.
VII. POST-CLASS PERIOD EVENTS
A. Bloomberg Publishes a May 29, 2024 Expose on Defendant Raja’s
Termination
On May 29, 2024, Bloomberg published a bombshell report titled “American Air
Fired Commercial Head After Sales Strategy Alienated Corporate Clients” (the “Bloomberg
Article”), reporting that Raja had been dismissed from American “in the wake of a critical
review from Bain & Co. that found [the Company’s] new marketing strategy was alienating
corporate clients, according to a person familiar with the matter.” The Bloomberg Article further
reported, in relevant part:
Chief Executive Officer Robert Isom fired veteran executive Vasu Raja in
recent days after receiving feedback in the report, which American commissioned
from the consulting firm. It revealed concerns by travel advisers over a recent
shift in the airline’s sales approach, which contributed to lagging revenue over
the past few quarters, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing
internal matters.
***
The new system the CCO had overseen, dubbed “modern retailing,” sought to
push customers away from booking agencies in favor of buying directly through
American’s website or app. The airline’s sales department was cut back as part of
the switch.
But the shift angered some corporate clients and travel management firms,
including claims that its technology wasn’t sufficiently developed. Raja had
acknowledged recently that its growth in vital managed corporate travel volumes
was trailing that at rivals United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc.
American compounded its error, industry officials have said, by having previously
declined requests from its longtime customers to slow down deployment of the
system.
B. American’s 2Q 2024 Press Release on July 25, 2024
On July 25, 2024, American issued a press release reporting high-level financial
and operational results for its second fiscal quarter of 2024 (the “2Q 2024 Press Release”). The
2Q 2024 Press Release was later attached as an exhibit to a Form 8-K that American filed with
the SEC that same day. In the 2Q 2024 Press Release, Defendant Isom was quoted as stating that
American continued to experience financial fallout from its “prior sales and distribution
strategy”:
“American has a fleet, network and product built to deliver results, but during
the second quarter, we did not perform to our initial expectations due to our
prior sales and distribution strategy and an imbalance of domestic supply and
demand,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “We are taking this challenge head-
on, with clear and decisive actions to deliver on a strategy that maximizes our
revenue and profitability, and importantly, one that makes it easy for
customers to do business with American. When we return to the level of
revenue generation we know we can achieve, and we couple that with our
operational reliability and best-in-class cost management, we will unlock
significant value.”
The 2Q 2024 Press Release also provided details on ways “American ha[d] taken
swift and aggressive action” to walk back its push towards NDC distribution that harmed travel
agencies:
Since May, the airline has focused its near-term efforts in three areas:
Ensuring content availability[:]
• Restored content. American has reinstated competitive fares in the
distribution channel traditionally used by travel agencies and
corporate managed travel programs.
• Removed plans to differentiate mileage earn by channel. Travelers
continue to earn in the AAdvantage® program as usual, no matter where
they book.
Making it easy, attractive and rewarding to do business with American[:]
• Expanded availability of AAdvantage Business™ benefits to agencies.
Companies will earn AAdvantage® miles and travelers will earn Loyalty
Points anywhere business travel is booked, including when booked
through travel agencies.
• Announced new features coming to AAdvantage Business™.
Improvements will enhance the travel management and end-traveler
experience.
Strengthening relationships and regaining the trust of partners[:]
• Listening to feedback. The company has conducted extensive outreach to
customers to inform them of changes being made to address pain points.
• Updating agreements. American is renegotiating contracts with
corporate customers and travel agencies.
• Improving support. The airline is adding account managers for corporate
customers, has established a dedicated AAdvantage Business™ customer
service team and is increasing sales support for agencies.
The 2Q 2024 Press Release further disclosed that American was lowering its full-
year 2024 guidance, stating in relevant part:
American has taken aggressive action to improve its revenue performance,
however, the company’s previous sales and distribution strategy will continue
to impact its revenue performance and earnings through the remainder of
the year. Accounting for these impacts and based on present demand trends, the
current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company
expects its third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be
approximately breakeven. The company now expects its full-year 2024
adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $0.70 and $1.30.
C. American’s 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024
On July 25, 2024, American also held a conference call to report its financial and
operational results for its second fiscal quarter of 2024 (the “2Q 2024 Earnings Call”). At the
outset of the call and during his prepared remarks, Defendant Isom “acknowledge[d] that [the
Company’s] current revenue performance is not where we want it to be” and explained that “[i]n
May, we made a sizable adjustment to our revenue and earnings expectations for the second
quarter, driven by an imbalance in domestic supply and demand and our prior sales and
distribution strategy.”
Isom identified the “2 key areas that are impacting [the Company’s] results” as
“[t]he softness in the domestic marketplace, and our sales and distribution strategy.”
With respect to demand, American’s abandoned sales and distribution strategy,
Isom stated:
In late May, I said our sales and distribution strategy was not working, and
we needed to make a change. We’re taking actions that will improve our
performance but a reset will take some time, and we will continue to feel the
impact of our prior sales and distribution strategy on revenue and earnings
through the remainder of this year, which is reflected in our updated full year
guidance.
Next, Isom outlined four key plans to “course-correct” the devasting impacts of
the Company’s prior strategy, all of which represented a complete about face to Defendants’
steadfast Class Period actions: (1) “chang[ing] senior leadership,” (2) “in June, reinstat[ing] fares
in the distribution channel traditionally used by travel agencies and corporate managed travel
programs,” (3) “engag[ing] [American’s] large TMC partners to put in place new incentive-
based agreements to restore [American’s] share in those channels[,]” and (4) “eliminat[ing] plans
to differentiate how customers earn miles based on where they book their travel, [thereby]
removing another significant obstacle impacting booking behavior and business relationships.”
Defendant May then provided an update with respect to the Company’s full-year
guidance in his prepared remarks, stating that full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share would
decrease approximately 55.6% to 69.2% compared to American’s falsely reported guidance
range during the Class Period ($2.25 to $3.25), and full-year free cash flow would drop by $1.5
billion. Specifically, Defendant May stated, in pertinent part:
Now I’d like to walk you through our outlook for the third quarter and provide an
update on our full year guidance. . . . At the midpoint of our full year guidance,
we now anticipate producing adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately
$1 and free cash flow of approximately $500 million.
During the question-and-answer portion of the call, analysts sought to understand
the drivers of the Company’s dismal financial outlook. In response, Defendant Isom blamed
American’s modern retailing strategy: “A lot of our problem is caused by our sales and
distribution strategy that we put in place in 2023. We think that it’s had about 3 quarters
of [a] billion dollars[’] impact in the first 6 months of the year, and we more or less assume
that, that is going to be what happens in the back half.”
During the call, a Raymond James analyst questioned whether American’s pivot
to building its corporate sales force back would impact the Company’s prior cost cutting
initiatives. Defendant May acknowledged that he “expect[ed] some amount of cost pressure as
[American] rebuild[s] the sale staff,” but Defendant Isom added, “What we’ve got to focus on
right now is regaining the share that we ceded from an agency and a corporate perspective
when we get that back, which we will.”
Returning the discussion back to the impacts of American’s modern retailing
strategy, a Melius Research LLC analyst questioned how the Company would win back its lost
share of corporate travel. Defendant Isom responded:
[T]he actions that we’ve taken so far have been really straightforward and that is
making sure that American’s content and product is available to any channel that
wants to access it. That’s done and that’s just that alone has resulted in us winning
back passenger share.
Now the next steps to that are then going to be making sure that we reestablish
productive relationships with the travel management companies and agencies.
We’re doing that. And I believe that, that will unlock further share growth. And
then on top of that, as I mentioned in my comments, I’ve talked to dozens of
corporations. And after getting content available and then also making sure that
we have appropriate relationships or in agreements in place with travel
management companies.
The next is to make sure that we’re doing everything that we can to have the right
agreements in place with our corporate customers and to support them in a way
that they feel valued. I know that we’ve started down that path and everything that
we’re doing is about winning back that share. I’ll just be frank. We over indexed
on direct, and we’ve got to find a way to get -- to play in the richer pool of
indirect revenue. And that starts with having content, having relationships --
positive relationships with travel management companies and agencies and then
supporting our corporate customers in the ways that they feel valued.
The same Melius analyst questioned whether American’s network strategy would
also require changes given the market’s concern about the Company’s liquidity. In response,
Isom ruled out network changes and pinned American’s poor financial results predominantly on
its modern retailing strategy, stating in relevant part:
Up until -- through 2023, we had been closing the margin gap with our top
competitors. The one thing that we did differently than others in 2023 is we
put in place a new sales and distribution strategy. We’ve recognized that
that’s not working, and we’re making immediate adjustments to that. I’ve
sized it for you in terms of the impact, which is large -- and that is -- I think it’s
had an impact of about $750 million in the first 6 months of the year, that is
something that we know that we can reverse and get back on the track of where
we had been, which was up until the first quarter of this year.
During the same earnings call, an Evercore analyst questioned whether Defendant
Raja’s removal allowed American to have more insight into the economy as it related to the
Company’s network planning. In response, Isom yet again emphasized that American’s
performance issues were caused by its modern retailing strategy, stating in relevant part:
But I’m going to underscore again, the biggest issue that we’ve had in terms of
disappointment was our misstep in our sales and distribution strategy. That would
have accounted for a considerable amount of additional revenue, and it’s
something that we’re going to make sure that we gain back.
When asked whether American was seeing demand softness during the 2Q 2024
Earnings Call, Defendant Isom conceded that American’s modern retail strategy resulted in
“missed” valuable premium revenue, stating in relevant part:
But as you know, we’ve seen significant pressure in parts of our network that
have been profitable and continue to be quite profitable, but just less so. So things
like our short-haul international MCLA. We’ve seen some pressure in other
places. A lot of it, again, due to the fact that we’ve missed out on a pool of
premium revenue and business traffic that we’re going to win back. As I take
a look overall, I don’t see a lot of variability in terms of impact throughout our
system, other than what I’ve noted.
During the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call, in response to a question from The Wall Street
Journal, Defendant Isom admitted that its airline partners pushed to reverse course on its
aggressive modern retailing strategy, stating in relevant part:
Look, our partners -- look, we go to market with them. And so the feedback that
we’re hearing from them is similar to what we’re hearing from our customers,
which is -- they want us back and available in every place that we can be sold.
They want to participate in a richer mix of business. They want to certainly be
attentive to the way our product is sold in the U.S. And so from that perspective,
they are encouraging us, number one, to get content back out. Second, to
make sure that we have agreements in place that facilitate the sale of our
product through travel management companies and agencies, and that they
want to have great relationships with corporates.
During the call, a Bloomberg News journalist sought to get more clarity about the
feedback that American received from its partners. In response, Defendant Isom admitted that
American knew that its strategy was having a negative impact on its financial operations during
1Q 2024, stating in relevant part:
Mary Schlangenstein
I wanted to follow up just a little bit on Ali’s first question. When you said that
the feedback you got from your oneworld and other partner airlines was similar to
what you’re hearing from corporate customers. Did you also hear from them
from some frustration and displeasure at the results of your change in
corporate strategy?
Robert D. Isom
We’re in communication with our partners constantly. And what they are
interested in seeing us do is to take quick action when we see any type of issues.
We’ve been alongside them. As I’ve said, we identified a deviation in terms of
our revenue performance versus some of our large network peers in the first
quarter. We thought that was going to reverse itself. It didn’t. We identified
that we needed to make a change. We were really quick and we’ve kept our
partners in touch all along, and they know our plans and certainly are supportive.
The Bloomberg News journalist pressed Isom on how the “$1.5 billion impact” of
American’s aggressive corporate strategy would affect the Company’s balance sheet,
representing $750 million in the first half of 2024, and $750 in the second half, that Defendant
Isom referred to earlier in the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call. In response, Isom acknowledged the
impact was to revenue and reiterated American’s complete reversal of its Class Period strategy in
an attempt to assuage investors’ concerns, stating in relevant part:
It’s revenue-based. And so -- but it’s rich revenue. So absolutely positively has a
big impact on contribution. As I said, we’re taking steps immediately to reverse
some of the reaction in terms of getting content at. We’ll see the benefits of new
agreements with travel management companies and agencies in the coming
months. Work with corporations may take a little bit longer, but we’re addressing
that as quickly as we can. And so as I take a look at, we’re going to try to get in a
good spot to kick off 2025 but we’ll have work to do. But all that said, I am
confident that over time, we’ll recapture our share.
VIII. ADDITIONAL SCIENTER ALLEGATIONS
Numerous facts alleged herein support a strong inference that Defendants knew or
recklessly disregarded that the statements set forth in Section V, supra, were materially false
and/or misleading when made. The below facts further solidify the inference of scienter as to
each Defendant. The scienter of the Individual Defendants and other senior executives is
properly imputed to American, as each Individual Defendant was among the Company’s senior
management and was acting within the scope of their employment.
The Individual Defendants had the opportunity to commit and participate in the
wrongful conduct complained of herein. Each was a senior executive officer and/or director of
American and, thus, controlled the information disseminated to the investing public in the
Company’s press releases and SEC filings. As a result, each could falsify the information that
reached investors about American’s business and performance.
A. Defendants Regularly Participated in Meetings Discussing American’s Poor
Performance Due to Distribution Strategy Changes
Numerous CWs confirmed that, throughout the Class Period, the Individual
Defendants regularly participated in meetings discussing, and the Individual Defendants outright
acknowledged, that: (i) travel agencies, TMCs, and corporations were not transitioning from
booking through EDIFACT channels to booking through American’s NDC channels as expected;
and (ii) American was losing share of agency, TMC, and corporate bookings (made either
through an in-house corporate travel department, or a TMC or travel agency) as these third
parties shifted to booking with competitor airlines, to the detriment of the Company’s revenues.
CW1 also stated that American’s Revenue Management team held a weekly
meeting to review raw data provided by IATA, which included the performance of each TMC by
region. The regions covered included Domestic, APAC, LATAM, Atlantic Joint-Business, and
Pacific Joint-Business. CW1 recalled that these weekly revenue meetings were attended by
American’s Vice President of Revenue Management, Scott Chandler, as well as then-Managing
Director of Commercial and Partner Analysis Tim Lyon. CW1 stated that it was clear from the
IATA data presented at the weekly meetings that American was losing corporate market share in
2023 and “everyone knew” it. CW1 reiterated that “we saw share going down” but, in response,
American’s leadership said that it was expected. CW1 added that Defendant Raja’s response was
that corporate clients essentially had no choice but to use American because the Company’s
“network” was so extensive.
Thus, as evidenced by the foregoing, the Individual Defendants made false and
misleading statements with scienter because they were aware that American’s NDC-focused
distribution strategy was negatively affecting the Company’s agency and corporate bookings and
revenue, thereby also hurting American’s share relative to that of competitors.
B. Defendants’ Hiring of Consulting Firm Amidst Changes to American’s
Distribution Strategy Strongly Supports Scienter
According to the May 29, 2024 Bloomberg Article, American “commissioned”
Bain to perform a “critical review” of American’s distribution strategy, which “revealed
concerns by travel advisers over [the] recent shift in [American]’s sales approach, which
contributed to lagging revenue over the past few quarters….” This led Defendant Isom to
“fire[] … Vasu Raja … days after receiving feedback in the report….”
The same day, The Wall Street Journal similarly reported that American had hired
Bain “in recent weeks … according to people familiar with the matter.”
As a matter of necessity, there was a period of time well before May 28, 2024
(when the Company announced Raja’s departure) when Defendants appreciated that modern
retailing was negatively affecting the Company, such that they understood the need to search for
and retain a consultant to perform a “critical review.” American’s engagement of Bain, a top
three management consulting firm globally, to investigate issues with the Company’s distribution
over several quarters strongly suggests that the Individual Defendants were aware of the issues
wrought by their aggressive push for NDC distribution—and the impacts on American’s
financial results—well before the impacts were revealed on May 28 and 29, 2024
This is especially true of Defendant Isom, who, per Bloomberg, personally
received the Bain report, and would have needed to approve the “commissioning” of Bain as
CEO and a Board member.
By May 28, 2024, Bain had already taken the time to perform its “critical
review,” and documented its analysis. Indeed, Bain provided its report “days” before Raja’s
ouster was announced on May 28, 2024, and Bain’s report was commissioned at least “weeks”
before that, which strongly suggests, by the even the most conservative of timelines, that
Defendants Isom and Raja were well aware that American’s NDC distribution strategy was
driving away travel agencies and corporate customers and thereby negatively affecting revenues
before issuing the late-Class Period misstatements.
Analyst commentary further bolsters the inference that Defendants were aware of
the negative impacts of American’s NDC distribution strategy for several quarters. For instance,
J.P. Morgan wrote in a May 28, 2024 report that Raja was “American’s corporate architect” and
that “we’d push back on the … thesis that he was simply the fall guy because of a missed
quarter. For starters, airlines don’t typically sack CCO’s for missing a quarter … in fact,
American stated it has begun a search for his replacement, and who would want to step into a
role where dismissal is just a few missed revenue points away?”
C. Defendants’ Post-Class Period Admissions Support Scienter
Defendants’ admissions following the Class Period, detailing that their changes to
American’s distribution strategy and approach to corporate sales and travel agency relationships
had been negatively impacting the Company’s performance for several quarters, strongly support
scienter.
During the Class Period, in American’s April 25, 2024 1Q 2024 Press Release,
Defendant Isom expressed disappointment with the Company’s financial results but nevertheless,
attempted to quell investor concerns that anything was amiss, stating in relevant part: “While we
aren’t satisfied with our first-quarter financial results, we have a strong foundation in place, and
we remain on track to deliver on our full-year financial targets.” However, after the Class Period
during the 2024 Bernstein Conference on May 29, 2024 (only one month later), Defendants
admitted that these results and “the softness in customer bookings” that continued into the
second fiscal quarter of 2024 were a direct result of “changes that we have made to our sales
and distribution strategy.” With respect to American’s push for NDC implementation,
Defendant Isom further admitted that “we move[d] faster than we should have and we didn’t
execute well” and that the approach was “driving customers away from American.”
Also during the 2024 Bernstein Conference, when asked by the host analyst how
far American’s unit revenue was behind compared to peers, Isom additionally admitted that,
looking back at first quarter 2024 results, it was clear that American “had a material drop off in
terms of total overall revenue performance. You can see that. Others were much more stable
and our results [should] look a lot more like theirs.” When asked which “benchmarks” Isom
used to compare American’s performance “relative to peers[,]” Isom admitted that “first and
foremost, its close in bookings. It's business travel[,]” and that “[c]learly, others are doing
better….” On the same call, Isom additionally stated that “we should have performed much
more in line with our network peers in the first quarter… I know that’s an opportunity for us to
recapture[,]” citing the “competitive” nature of the marketplace. Thus, Isom through his
admissions strongly implied that the Individual Defendants had been aware in the first quarter
that the Company was losing share to competitors.
Defendant Isom also admitted at the 2024 Bernstein Conference that Defendant
Raja was not solely responsible for American’s distribution strategies that had hurt American’s
sales revenues and PSP, stating in relevant part during the Bernstein Conference that “our
strategy is the company strategy. Those are my strategies, okay?” Thus, Defendant Isom
admitted that both he and Defendant Raja were involved in the Company’s disastrous
distribution strategy changes.
Then, during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call on July 25, 2024, Defendant Isom
expounded on the disastrous impacts of American’s approach, admitting that “[a] lot of our
problem [was] caused by our sales and distribution strategy that we put in place in 2023. We
think that it’s had about 3 quarters of [a] billion dollars[’] impact in the first 6 months of the
year.” During the call, Isom also admitted that “[u]p until -- through 2023, we had been closing
the margin gap with our top competitors [and] [t]he one thing that we did differently than others
in 2023 is we put in place a new sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom also admitted
that American had “over indexed on direct” and “ceded [share] from an agency and a corporate
perspective” to its competitors during the Class Period. Defendant Isom further admitted that
American knew that these issues existed during the first quarter but nevertheless obscured the
severity of impacts in hopes that the results would reverse, stating in relevant part: “[W]e
identified a deviation in terms of our revenue performance versus some of our large
network peers in the first quarter. We thought that was going to reverse itself. It didn’t.”
These admissions, particularly in conjunction with American’s decision to hire a
consultant to review its distribution strategy as discussed in Section VIII.B, supra, support that
Defendant Isom knew by, at latest, Q1 2024 that American’s approach was driving away
customers and tanking revenues, particularly when compared with Delta and United, but
nevertheless, made a calculated decision to obscure how American’s distribution strategy was
performing in hopes the situation would right itself.
D. Defendants’ Access to and Review of Data Demonstrating the Negative
Impacts of NDC Distribution Changes Supports Scienter
Information from multiple CWs, as well as the Individual Defendants’ own
admissions, demonstrates that the Individual Defendants reviewed detailed data relating to
corporate and agency bookings, market share, and NDC adoption. Thus, the Individual
Defendants knew or should have known that American’s modern distribution strategy was
hurting the company’s bookings, revenue, and share, adding to the inference that their Class
Period misstatements were made with scienter.
Defendants Received Detailed Reports Concerning American’s Performance
Compared to Competitors and NDC Adoption
According to CW1, Defendant Raja could “see the numbers” for business
between American and agencies by way of reviewing data from reports issued by IATA. As
CW1 explained, IATA published monthly reports providing very detailed airline industry data,
including how much share a given agency represented “in any given cabin.” CW1 also stated that
IATA published preliminary results within a few weeks of a month’s close, as well as final
results six weeks following a given month’s close. CW1 explained that IATA partnered with
firms called Direct Data Solutions and ARC to provide reports on each travel agency’s market
share of airline ticket sales.
As such, Defendant Raja could observe metrics breaking down the share of
bookings business between American’s direct/NDC channels versus bookings through
EDIFACT channels by way of reviewing data from reports issued by IATA.
CW2 confirmed that American measures the performance of its agency accounts
through tracking financial performance, such as number of bookings, revenue, and share, and
moreover that a key metric the Company tracked was the rate at which each agency, TMC, and
corporation was utilizing modern distribution channels for bookings versus traditional
distribution channels. According to CW2, American’s management could see global data
pertaining to all third parties on the SalesLink Insights platform, including granular details per
agency, TMC, or corporation, and per route in American’s network, such that American tracked
certain financial metrics and whether they were on trend, how much share of bookings made
through the third-party distribution partners were going to the Company versus competitor
airlines, and the rates that each agency, TMC, or corporation booked through NDC. Moreover,
CW2 recounted that American also used the software PRISM to track share by revenue and
percentage versus competitors and NDC usage. CW2 and peers in Sales monitored such metrics
in SalesLink Insights and reports generated from PRISM “constantly” because the metrics
determined CW2’s and sales peers’ quarterly bonuses. Thus, CW2 was able to observe that
shortly after the Company pushed the July 2023 Contracts on agencies, TMCs, and corporations,
bookings and share through these third parties dropped. Crucially, CW2 observed that bookings
from larger agencies declined 15% year-over-year in July 2023, with corporate bookings “much
lower” than that, and that these figures and share percentage remaining “consistently down” in
PRISM through the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January 2024.
Defendants’ Admitted Access to and Review of Metrics Concerning NDC
Rollout and its Effects on Market Share, Revenues, and Third-Party
Bookings Supports Scienter
Prior to and throughout the Class Period, the Individual Defendants made
numerous statements indicating that they regularly monitored data relating to the performance of
American’s NDC rollout. Thus, the Individual Defendants knew or should have known that
many agencies, TMCs, and corporations were not adopting NDC, and that Defendants’ NDC
strategy was negatively affecting American’s revenues and market share, thus adding to a strong
inference that their Class Period false and misleading statements were made with scienter.
Defendants spoke to investors and answered detailed questions about progress in
the adoption of modern retailing and associated revenues on many occasions, including the
following sampling of such statements:
i. On American’s January 26, 2023 earnings call held to report the Company’s
fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results (“FY2022 Earnings Call”), Defendant
Raja stated that “…roughly 60-ish percent of our revenues are coming direct to us
through our .com and mobile app….”
ii. On American’s first quarter 2023 earnings call on April 27, 2023 (the “1Q 2023
Earnings Call”), Defendant Raja stated that “by the end of this month, over 60%
of our servicing transactions…”—i.e., changes or modifications to existing
bookings, such as adding baggage or meals—“…are coming digitally”—i.e.
through direct and NDC channels. Raja stated on the same call that “we're seeing
10 to 15 points of transaction share shift out of travel agencies and into the direct
channel….”
iii. On American’s 2Q 2023 Earnings Call on July 20, 2023, Defendant Raja stated
that “…we’re currently in taking roughly 70% to 75% of our revenues going
through our direct channels.”
iv. On American’s 3Q 2023 Earnings Call on October 19, 2023, Defendant Isom
stated that “[i]n the third quarter, approximately 80% of our bookings came from
our own channels and modern retailing technology....” Isom’s comments were
accompanied by a slide presented to investors that stated, in fact, 78% of
bookings were through the modern technology, which includes American’s
website, mobile app, and NDC direct bookings, and that the remainder of
bookings were through legacy technology—i.e., EDIFACT. Raja stated on the 3Q
2023 Earnings Call that “…right now, what we’re in taking in terms of revenue is
actually about 80% going through, as we call it, Internet-based distribution, of
which about 70 of those 80 points is going through our true direct[ ]channels[,
aa].com and [the American] app and the balance coming through new distribution
technologies”—i.e., NDC.
v. On American’s FY2023 Earnings Call held January 25, 2024, Defendant Raja
stated that “we’re 80% coming through Internet-based technology. Within that,
65-plus percent is coming just strictly through our owned channels…”—i.e., the
Company’s website and smartphone app. American also displayed a slide to
investors confirming these same figures, noting the remaining 20% of fourth
quarter 2023 bookings were through legacy distribution systems.
vi. On American’s 1Q 2024 Earnings Call held April 25, 2024, Defendant Raja stated
that “the agencies that constitute about 30% to 40% of our revenue are already
doing more than 30% of their bookings through NDC….” During the call,
Defendants also displayed a slide to investors stating that 81% of bookings in the
first quarter of 2024 had been made through modern distribution technology.
As evidenced by the foregoing, the Individual Defendants—particularly Isom and
Raja—regularly monitored whether or not agencies, TMCs, and corporations were switching
their bookings (and associated revenues) to modern distribution methods in response to the
Company’s changes.
The Individual Defendants not only tracked the adoption of modern retailing, but
also admittedly monitored the effects that American’s distribution strategy changes were having
on the Company’s business, including revenues and specifically revenues from corporate
customers. Indeed, Defendant Raja stressed the importance of corporate travel on multiple
occasions, stating on the FY2022 Earnings Call that “business travel is … 25% of our
revenues…” and Defendant Isom stated at the March 14, 2023 J.P. Morgan Conference that
“[f]or us, corporate travel is incredibly important.”
Thus, prior to and throughout the Class Period, analysts repeatedly asked about
how well corporate travel was recovering compared to levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially given American’s changes to its distribution strategy, and the Individual Defendants
regularly provided updates, indicating that they were closely tracking these metrics including by
segment of corporate travel. These statements included:
i. On September 7, 2022 at a conference hosted by Cowen and Company, LLC,
Defendant Isom stated that “our business revenue from a domestic perspective is
above where it was in 2019, okay? So I think it’s running 105% of where we were
in 2019. That has been really pushed by small and medium-sized businesses. And
so you see that, that has really outperformed corporates, what we used to think of
as the big corporates,” which were “about, in terms of revenue, 75% recovered.”
ii. On October 20, 2022 on American’s earnings call to report its third quarter 2022
results, Defendant Isom stated that “business revenue remain[s] incredibly strong
… surpassing 2019 levels in the third quarter[,]” adding that “[d]emand for small-
and medium-sized businesses and customers traveling for a combination of
business and leisure continue to outpace the recovery of managed corporate
travel.” On the same call, Defendant Raja stated that “contracted corporations are
80% recovered…” and that “unmanaged business is coming in at yield values
where their gross yields are similar to the corporate contracted transactions that
are not there[,]” adding “managed corporate hasn’t come back yet… the really
critical word in that sentence is the word yet.”
iii. On the FY2022 Earnings Call held January 26, 2023, Defendant Raja stated that
“non-contracted business is 100% recovered, contracted business is about 75%
recovered.”
iv. On May 25, 2023 at a conference hosted by Wolfe Research, Defendant May
stated that “traditional corporate is still pretty consistent with what we talked
about a month ago, blended travel continues to be a big component of our demand
and leisure is really, really strong” and that overall corporate business recovery
was “75% to 80% [of] where we were in 2019.” May described that lower-than-
historic corporate revenues had led Defendants to “guide[ ] unit revenue down 2%
to down 4% for the quarter[.]” When asked by Wolfe’s host analyst whether this
would change, Defendant May confirmed that Defendants were monitoring and
would continue to monitor the situation, stating “there’s corporate strength in
some businesses, there’s weakness in some areas like tech. So we’ll see how this
develops over the next year or so. But one thing we found over the last couple of
years is demand profiles continue to change, and we need to continue to adapt to
any changes in demand.”
v. On the 2Q 2023 Earnings Call held July 20, 2023, Defendant Raja stated that
“total business revenues have really regained their 2019 composition in the
system.” Raja added that “[w]e’ve seen that those customers who … buy their
travel centrally”—i.e., through an agency or TMC— “has … recovered to 80% of
historical levels” and that, comparatively, “unmanaged demand continues to grow
in our system.”
vi. On the 3Q 2023 Earnings Call held October 19, 2023, Defendant Raja stated that
“[i]n the quarter, our total business revenues were up 2%” and Defendant Isom
stated “we saw year-over-year growth in corporate … revenue with a return to
more traditional seasonality trends. We remain encouraged by what we’re seeing
with demand and revenue from unmanaged business travel.”
vii. On American’s FY2023 Earnings Call held January 25, 2024, Defendant Isom
stated that “[d]omestic revenues from business travel ended the fourth quarter at
approximately 90% of 2019 levels.” Defendant Raja stated on the same call that
“[w]e too exit Q4 with a 90% business recovery. Within that unmanaged business
versus managed businesses[,] almost a 3:1 ratio with unmanaged business 100%
plus covered, managed business down further. The impact on managed business is
really flat from traffic on higher yields.”
viii. On March 12, 2024 at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Conference, Defendant Isom stated
that “[w]e know that business travel is not all the way back yet.”
ix. On American’s 1Q 2024 Earnings Call held April 25, 2024, Defendant Isom
stated that “[b]usiness travel has continued to recover with particular strength in
small and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, we have seen sequential
improvement in the recovery of managed corporate travel and domestic business
revenue growth outpaced capacity growth in the first quarter.” Defendant Raja
also spoke on the call, stating that “our business revenues are growing at a greater
rate than capacity. Unmanaged is on the higher end of that contract in corporates
which would presumably be the most effective, are just slightly on the lower end
of that.” When asked by an analyst, Raja clarified that “we see total business
revenues, which is really a very important thing to look at grow similarly double-
digit -- close or approaching double digits, exiting certainly Q1 double-digit rates
of growth. It’s really being driven by unmanaged corporations that continue to
come back and come back to American Airlines. Managed corporates, contract
and corporations are growing a little bit less than that, but still high -- in the mid-
to high single digits.”
The foregoing statements demonstrate that the Individual Defendants regularly
reviewed detailed metrics concerning the revenue performance of corporate travel at American.
Their consistent references to specific revenue recovery percentages and comparisons between
managed and unmanaged corporate travel, including nuances by region within American’s
network, indicate a granular level of oversight. This detailed monitoring strongly supports the
inference that Defendants knew or should have known that changes to American’s distribution
strategy negatively impacted the Company’s corporate travel revenues and market share.
Defendants’ Granular Review of Agency and Corporate Metrics Supports
Scienter
The Individual Defendants’ statements during the Class Period demonstrate that
they monitored American’s share of the corporate travel market. For instance, on the Company’s
1Q 2023 Earnings Call held April 27, 2023, a Wall Street Journal journalist asked Defendant
Raja “we have heard companies and agencies sort of complaining about some of the changes
American has made. … are you seeing any market share shift?” In response, Raja strongly
suggested that Defendants were tracking American’s market share granularly by agency, stating
“from a given agency to another, we may see a little bit” of share shifting to competitors.
Similarly, at the March 12, 2024 J.P. Morgan Conference, Defendant Isom stated “while you
may have seen some changes to our sales force”—i.e., changes made in furtherance of
Defendants’ new distribution strategies—“… we’ve been able to hang on to our share as well.”
Similarly, during the 1Q 2024 Earnings Call, Raja indicated that he reviewed
corporate-related metrics as granularly as by market, stating that “as corporates are coming back,
they're coming in more disproportionately to coastal markets where we’re relatively smaller in.
As unmanaged business comes back, it comes back in the Heartland and the Sunbelt, where we
are relatively larger in.”
Read collectively, the statements and admissions in Section VIII.D indicate that
the Individual Defendants regularly reviewed key metrics relating to the performance of
American’s corporate travel business, and the Individual Defendants knew or should have known
that, due to their aggressive changes made to American’s distribution strategy in furtherance of
NDC and direct bookings, the Company was losing both revenue from and market share of
corporate travel.
E. Defendants’ Evasive Answers to Analysts’ and Journalists’ Pointed
Questions is Indicative of Scienter
Throughout the Class Period, analysts repeatedly questioned Defendants on the
execution of American’s shift to NDC distribution and whether it was having a negative effect
on the Company’s business. Certain of Defendants’ highly evasive answers suggest that
Defendants were aware of issues with the NDC execution, but that Defendants wanted to avoid
discussing it or otherwise downplay the significance of the NDC-related issues.
For example, on American’s 3Q 2023 Earnings Call on October 19, 2023,
Defendant Raja was asked plainly whether he had seen American’s share of the corporate travel
market shift due to the Company’s push towards NDC distribution. Raja did not directly answer
that question, but instead, while admitting “[i]t’s another question, which I know is on people’s
minds” stated:
We’re shifting content bare products, schedules, things like that, out of legacy
technology where we can’t provide customers the kind of shopping and servicing
experience they expect and we’re putting it through technologies that can. And on
that journey, we’ve certainly invited all of our retailers to come along with it, but
that is a different world than what was there before. And what we’ve seen before
is really encouraging actually. In the quarter, our total business revenues
were up 2%.
We actually performed better year-over-year among contracted corporations
than we had in a number of months prior to it. But very importantly, our cost
of sale is down 13%. So we’re finding that we’re able to generate more revenues
through less cost of sale, which is very encouraging to us. And like I said, as we
go forward, we intend to continue the momentum that we’ve got. We certainly
invite any retailing partner to join us along the journey.
And in fact, most recently, we launched a new business program called
AAdvantage Business. And AAdvantage is very much the platform upon which
we will build all of our commercial programs. But through that -- through
AAdvantaged Business companies of all sizes can access our content in a way
that’s cheaper simpler, better servicing and in a way that is more awarding for
travelers. We’ll accelerate their status. So, we’re actually really encouraged by
what we’ve seen, encouraged by its revenue production and look forward to
continuing the momentum.
Defendant Raja was also evasive during American’s FY 2023 Earnings Call held
on January 25, 2024 when BofA analyst Andrew George Didora asked what “growing pains”
American experienced with its NDC roll out. Raja did not directly answer the question:
Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question. Look, I’ll answer it in this way. We have been
similarly enthusiastic and even a little surprised at how quickly the transition has
happened. It’s not just that we're 80% coming through Internet-based technology.
Within that 65-plus percent is coming just strictly through our owned channels,
which is our greatest rate of growth. So first, I will say, strategically, we’re going
to distribute through the Internet. It’s what our customers demand. That’s how we
give them the best fares and the lowest expenses and the best servicing.
So at some point, the number becomes 100. And the real issue in 2024 is we want
to just continue to transition as many of our retailing partners to use the Internet
with us. So ultimately, it becomes 100. We're really encouraged by what we’ve
seen there.
Defendant Raja’s refusal to answer questions concerning whether American was
losing market share or experiencing growing pains as a result of its American’s distribution
strategy changes and NDC roll out strongly implies that he knew that customers were reacting
negatively to American’s NDC execution, including by migrating share away from the Company
to its competitors, but sought to obscure the significant impacts by providing evasive answers to
analysts’ questions.
F. Defendants’ Statements Concerned American’s Primary Source of Revenue
and Core Operation, Further Supporting Scienter
Defendants’ scienter is further supported by the critical importance of American’s
sales and distribution to success of the Company’s core operation.
American’s core operation is providing scheduled air transportation to passengers.
In 2023, according to American’s FY2023 Form 10-K, the Company received nearly 92% of its
$52.8 billion total operating revenues (i.e., $48.5 billion) from passenger air travel and ancillary
services associated with such travel. Indeed, American characterized its “primary business
activity” in its FY2023 Form 10-K as “the operation of a major network air carrier, providing
scheduled air transportation for passengers[.]”
A significant portion of that revenue is derived from distribution to corporate
customers. According to Defendant Isom’s remarks during the 2Q 2024 Earnings Call,
“[a]pproximately $14 billion of [the Company’s] annual revenue [in 2023] was booked” through
“the distribution channel traditionally used by travel agencies and corporate managed travel
programs” (i.e., EDIFACT). American’s sales and distribution strategy—namely, its NDC
implementation and corresponding changes to corporate and agency sales—were designed to
push those bookings to direct and NDC channels to simultaneously increase revenues and cut the
costs associated with managed travel. That strategy was therefore critically important to the
Company’s core operation.
Indeed, throughout the Class Period, American staked its sales and distribution
strategy on driving corporate customers to its NDC and direct channels to cut costs and increase
revenues. The Company also claimed that its customers expected a shopping and servicing
experience that was only available through NDC and American’s direct channels and as such,
these changes were necessary. For instance, during American’s Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Raja
stated:
We have made a number of changes with our selling and distribution strategy.
The purpose of which is very simple. Our customers have been telling us for a
very long time now that they want it so that anything that we offer them can be
shopped, sold and serviced digitally. And we’ve been seeing that customer
sentiment for a really long time. And that’s what we’re out to serve. And our
strategy is this simple. In order to go make that happen, we need to distribute our
product exclusively through the Internet.
And that’s what you’re seeing from us. We’re shifting content fare products,
schedules, things like that, out of legacy technology where we can’t provide
customers the kind of shopping and servicing experience they expect and we’re
putting it through technologies that can. And on that journey, we’ve certainly
invited all of our retailers to come along with it, but that is a different world than
what was there before. And what we’ve seen before is really encouraging
actually. In the quarter, our total business revenues were up 2%.
We actually performed better year-over-year among contracted corporations than
we had in a number of months prior to it. But very importantly, our cost of sale is
down 13%. So we’re finding that we’re able to generate more revenues through
less cost of sale, which is very encouraging to us.
During the same call, Raja represented that the vast majority of the Company’s
revenues were coming through the Company’s NDC and direct channels and emphasized their
importance to the Company’s bookings, stating in relevant part:
So what we saw as we were going through COVID, was already without
American Airlines making any strategic changes, we went from about selling 50%
direct to selling about 60% direct and right now, what we're in taking in terms
of revenue is actually about 80% going through, as we call it, Internet-based
distribution, of which about 70 of those 80 points is going through our true
direct[] channels[, ].com and app[,] and the balance coming through new
distribution technologies. In fact, our Internet-based travel agency
technologies is now a bigger source of bookings than any of the legacy global
distribution systems are.
Then, during the Company’s FY 2023 Earnings Call, in response to an analyst’s
question about American’s distribution strategy, Defendant Raja emphasized that American’s
direct bookings were the Company’s greatest opportunity of growth, stating in relevant part:
We have been similarly enthusiastic and even a little surprised at how quickly the
transition has happened. It’s not just that we’re 80% coming through Internet-
based technology. Within that, 65-plus percent is coming just strictly through our
owned channels, which is our greatest rate of growth.
However, as discussed above in Section VIII.D, supra, Defendants had access to
reports with detailed metrics showing that beginning as early as 3Q 2023, American was losing
share to its competitors as a direct result of the Company’s sales and distribution strategy.
Moreover, Defendant Isom publicly admitted that Defendants knew during 1Q 2024 that
American’s performance was lagging as compared to its competitors but nevertheless, continued
making rosy statements in hopes that the situation would right itself. Such information was
directly at odds with Defendants’ public statements, repeatedly exclaiming that they had “seen
… encouraging signs from managed and unmanaged corporate customers[,]” were “really
pleased” with NDC adoption and “encouraged by the results so far[,]” and “demand is strong
across the board.”
Moreover, that American’s Class Period sales and distribution strategy ultimately
caused a staggering $750 million loss of revenue in the first half of 2024 further bolsters that the
mispresented information was readily apparent to Defendants. It strains credulity to suggest that
Defendants were unaware of the negative impact of their distribution strategy shift when it
caused such a substantial loss of revenue.
IX. LOSS CAUSATION
At all relevant times, the market for American securities was open, well-
developed, and efficient. During the Class Period, Defendants materially misled the investing
public, thereby inflating the price of American’s securities and/or maintaining the artificial
inflation in American’s common stock price, by publicly issuing and endorsing materially false
and/or misleading statements and omitting to disclose material facts necessary to make those
statements, as set forth herein in Section V, supra, not materially false or misleading. Said
statements and omissions were materially false and/or misleading in that they failed to disclose
materially adverse information and/or misrepresented the truth about the Company’s business,
operations, and prospects as alleged herein.
At all relevant times, the material misrepresentations and omissions particularized
in this Complaint directly or proximately caused or were a substantial contributing cause of the
damages sustained by Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class. As described herein, during
the Class Period, Defendants made or caused to be made, or failed to correct, a series of
materially false or misleading statements concerning the Company’s shift in distribution strategy,
which eroded American’s market share and decimated revenues. Defendants’ statements were
materially and objectively misleading when made, as set forth supra at Section V, and had the
cause and effect of creating in the market an unrealistically positive assessment of American’s
rollout of NDC distribution channels in lieu of traditional channels, including how well the
Company’s sales via agencies and to corporate customers were performing as a result of the
transition to NDC, thus causing American’s securities to be overvalued and artificially inflated at
all relevant times during the Class Period. The materially false or misleading statements made or
endorsed by Defendants during the Class Period resulted in Plaintiffs and other members of the
Class purchasing American’s securities at artificially inflated prices, thus causing the damages
complained of herein.
As a result of their purchases of American’s securities during the Class Period at
artificially inflated prices, Plaintiffs and the other Class members suffered economic loss, i.e.,
damages, under the federal securities laws, when the misrepresentations made to the market and
the information alleged herein to have been concealed from the market were revealed. The
timing and magnitude of the price declines in American’s securities, the statements in
Defendants’ corrective disclosures, and the market’s reaction negate any inference that the loss
suffered by Plaintiffs and other Class members was caused by changed market conditions,
macroeconomic or industry factors, or facts specific to the Company that were unrelated to
Defendants’ fraudulent conduct. This is supported by the stock chart in Figure 1, below, which
demonstrates the clear divergence in the performance of American’s common stock price from
Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) when the truth emerged
in a series of partial disclosures on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024:

-17.00%
As shown by the foregoing, the price of American’s common stock dropped to close 13.54%
lower on May 29, 2024 while its two major competitors remained relatively steady. Moreover, it
became clear within just two days—by May 31, 2024—that American’s stock was significantly
underperforming Delta’s and United’s stocks, strongly indicating that the drop in the Company’s

Change in Price of Stock at Market Close vs. Closing Price on May 28, 2024
American Airlines Group Inc. (NasdaqGS:AAL) - Share Pricing
Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) - Share Pricing
United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NasdaqGS:UAL) - Share Pricing
stock price was uniquely due to Defendants’ disclosures on May 28 and 29, 2024, and not due to
an industry-wide trend such as soft demand.
On the evening of May 28, 2024 and the morning of May 29, 2024 (i.e., after the
stock market closed for trading on the 28th and before it reopened on the 29th), Defendants
revealed the truth that American had been “driving customers away from American” “due to the
changes that [Defendants] made to [the Company’s] sales and distribution strategy” in pursuit of
driving NDC distribution, particularly customers who booked via agencies and business
travelers, which had hurt demand for American’s fares and services. In disclosing the negative
impacts of the Company’s aggressive push towards NDC distribution, Defendant Isom explained
that American had not been making its products “available wherever customers want to buy it”—
i.e., including legacy, non-NDC distribution channels—and that American had “move[d] faster
than we should have” in pursuit of NDC distribution. The Company also conspicuously
announced that Defendant Raja, the leader of American’s NDC strategy, was to depart from the
airline.
As a result, American announced it was slashing its guidance for its second fiscal
quarter of 2024, including notably lowering its guidance for adjusted operating margin by a full
percentage point, and slashing its expectations for second-half 2024 growth by over half from
8% to just 3.5%. American also announced that for the second quarter, it was: (i) lowering its
adjusted earnings per share guidance range by 13% and over 20% at the low and high ends,
respectively; (ii) expecting TRASM to decline 100-400% more than previously guided; and
(iii) reducing CASM-ex growth expectations by up to 200%.
Upon these disclosures, American’s share price fell $1.82 per share, or more than
13.54%, from its close at $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May
29, 2024, thereby damaging investors.
Market analysts and industry media were surprised by Defendants’ May 28 and
29, 2024 disclosures. Analysts from Jefferies wrote in a May 28, 2024 report—before
Defendants’ disclosures on May 29—that American was “trailblazing NDC, which will take
some time to fine-tune and extract … value from[,]” noting that the Company was seeing “[near-
term] corporate underperformance” compared to competitor airlines. Similarly, Evercore ISI
wrote in an analyst report published May 28, 2024 that “[g]iven the change in commercial
leadership”—i.e., Defendant Raja’s departure—“we suspect the focus on lower cost distribution
(deemphasizing corporate sales channels), including restructuring/layoffs of American’s
corporate sales organization may be continuing to play a role in softer relative trends.”
Deutsche Bank analysts, writing in a May 28, 2024 report, suspected that given
the Company announced that day that “Vasu Raja would be leaving American in June[,]” “some
of the company’s moves have been viewed as punitive by the travel agency community
(particularly those tied to New Distribution Capability (NDC)-adoption) which responded by
steering ‘their’ customers (including corporate) away from American.”
In the same report, Deutsche Bank analysts commented on American’s lowered
guidance noting that the “year-over-year unit revenue (i.e., TRASM) decline of 5% to 6% versus
its prior projected decline of 1% to 3%” (i.e., a “unit revenue miss of 3.5 percentage points (at
the midpoints))” was “material as [the analysts] estimate[d] each point equates to about $150
million of top line.” With respect to full year guidance, the report added “[w]e note the investor
update did not include an affirmation of the company’s full-year 2024 EPS guide of $2.25 to
$3.25 which we are now below the low end by 7%.” The report also distinguished American’s
performance from its competitors, stating “that a good portion of American’s top-line weakness
may be American-specific” and particularly given “United also filed an 8-K this evening
reiterating its June quarter EPS guide of $3.75 to $4.25 which compares with our EPS estimate
of $4.00.”
In a May 28, 2024 report, Bernstein analysts were surprised by the extent of
American’s guidance reduction, stating in relevant part: “[a] significant miss driven in part by
close in bookings puts AAL’s ability to reap the full value of a robust summer flying season in
greater doubt” and further attributed the “close in booking weakness … to loss of corporate
travel share associated with recent distribution strategy changes (positive read across to
DAL/UAL).” The same report surmised that the “[c]hange in leadership could mean rolling back
distribution changes[.]” Then, in a report published after Defendant Isom’s disclosures at the
May 29 Bernstein Conference, Bernstein wrote that “the key culprit behind [American]’s unit
revenue guide down” was its distribution strategy, which the Company would now have to
“swiftly adjust” to make its fares and services “more easily accessible,” including by walking
back restrictive NDC “plans that would’ve hurt some customers’ ability to gain miles based on
where they booked….” Bernstein further wrote that American had revealed that it “particularly
struggled … due to modernizing distribution strategy that reduced customer access to their
products and hurt some relationships[.]”
Bloomberg, in an article originally published May 28, 2024 that was updated May
29, 2024, wrote that American “slashed profit and revenue expectations[,]” and that the issues
disclosed by the Company “stemmed in part from a recent shift in the airline’s sales strategy that
sought to push customers away from booking agencies in favor of buying directly through
American. The revelations — along with the abrupt departure of its chief commercial officer —
sent the carrier’s shares plunging the most in almost four years….” Bloomberg also noted that,
given Vasu Raja had been a leader in the Company’s move towards modern retailing, Defendant
“Isom on Wednesday appeared to fault Raja for the carrier’s recent stumble, saying ‘we need to
reset’ in reference to the management change.”
Writing in a May 29, 2024 report, J.P. Morgan analysts noted that the “[m]ore
interesting” aspect of the Company’s May 28 and 29, 2024 disclosures was “American’s public
capitulation regarding its corporate distribution strategy,” which the analysts noted “has moved
to center stage with urgency.” Though J.P. Morgan had previously hypothesized that the
Company’s distribution strategy posed a “potential risk,” the analyst firm wrote in its May 29
report that “American’s corporate capitulation is a bit of a vindication” of that theory, prompting
J.P. Morgan to lower its price target for American’s stock from $24 to $21 per share, a decline of
12.5%.
Likewise, analysts at Morningstar wrote in a May 29, 2024 report that the primary
factor affecting American’s slashed guidance and soft demand from agency and corporate buyers
“at issue is American’s aggressive moves to modernize the way it digitally sells and distributes
its tickets,” which the Company had “self-inflicted” but hoped to “reverse.”
Susquehanna, in a May 30, 2024 report titled “Time for a Reset,” noted that
“Vasu Raja’s departure comes as somewhat of a surprise,” but that “importantly,” American’s
distribution strategy was revealed to be “clearly not resonating with customers….” The report
also attributed American’s performance to “an execution issue,” stating “2Q’s TRASM update
(now down fully ~5-6% Y/Y, or ~350bps below the mid-pt. of the prior guide) in our view looks
like more of an execution issue, with competitor [United Airlines] recently noting that demand
remains healthy.” As a result, Susquehanna lowered its price target for American stock by over
13%, from $15 to $13 per share. Analysts at Citi similarly lowered their price target in a May 31,
2024 report, down 17.5% from $20 per share to $16.50, after “American Airlines’ trim to its 2Q
revenue per available seat mile or RASM guide sent very concerning signals on the carrier’s
underlying ticket revenue strategies” which included American’s NDC distribution method.
Barclays wrote in a report published May 30, 2024 that its analysts found it
“interesting that the airline is abandoning its ‘modern retailing approach’ and that the CCO has
left. We suspect this was a relevant contributor to the revenue weakness.” Barclays added that
“No other airline has followed this path. The evidence would seem to suggest the American
innovation was not a success and that they are ready to evolve to a more consumer-friendly
path.” The report also distinguished American from its competitors, stating that “American’s
revenue guidance was very out of kilter with peers” and that “the issue was guidance not the
reality of the travel market.”
Morgan Stanley, writing in a June 3, 2024 report titled “Two Steps Back,”
contrasted American’s poor results from that of competitors, noting that an “AAL specific”
factor was how the Company had been “particularly pushing too hard on direct distribution, …
ceding competitive corporate / dense route share to peers…” clarifying “a large part of the
[demand] softness [was] specific to AAL.” Morgan Stanley thus lowered its price target for
American stock by 10%, from $20 per share to $18.
Thus, the damages suffered by Plaintiffs and the other Class members were a
direct result of Defendants’ fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the price of American
common stock and the subsequent declines in the value of American common stock when
Defendants’ prior misrepresentations were revealed.
X. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and
(b)(3) on behalf of a class of all persons that purchased or otherwise acquired American publicly
traded securities between July 20, 2023 and May 28, 2024, inclusive, seeking to pursue remedies
under the Exchange Act. Excluded from the Class are the Company and their subsidiaries and
affiliates, and their respective officers and directors at all relevant times, and any of their
immediate families, legal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns, and any entity in which
any Defendant has or had a controlling interest.
Because American’s securities were actively traded on the Nasdaq, the members
of the Class are so numerous that joinder of all Class members is impracticable. Indeed,
American reported in its FY2023 Form 10-K that, as of February 16, 2024, there were
approximately 54,000 record holders of its common stock; however, since many of the shares of
its common stock were held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, it is
believed there are substantially more beneficial holders of American’s common stock than record
holders. Accordingly, while the exact number of Class members is unknown at this time and can
only be ascertained through discovery, Plaintiffs believe that there are hundreds or thousands of
Class members. Members of the Class may be identified from records maintained by American
or its transfer agent and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail, using forms of
notice customarily used in securities class actions.
Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the members of the Class, as all Class
members have been similarly affected by Defendants’ wrongful conduct as alleged herein.
Moreover, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and have retained
competent counsel who are experienced in class action and securities litigation.
Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class members and predominate
over any questions solely affecting individual Class members. These common questions include:
i. Whether Defendants violated the federal securities laws as alleged herein;
ii. Whether Defendants’ statements to the investing public during the Class Period
misrepresented material facts about the Company’s business and operations;
iii. Whether Defendants’ public statements to the investing public during the Class
Period omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
iv. Whether the Individual Defendants caused the Company to issue false and
misleading SEC filings and public statements during the Class Period;
v. Whether Defendants acted knowingly or recklessly in issuing false and
misleading SEC filings and public statements during the Class Period;
vi. Whether the prices of American’s securities during the Class Period were
artificially inflated because of Defendants’ conduct complained of herein; and
vii. Whether the members of the Class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper
measure of damages.
A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient
adjudication of this matter as joinder of all Class members is impracticable. Furthermore, as the
damages suffered by individual Class members may be relatively small, the expense and burden
of individual litigation make it impossible for Class members to individually redress the wrongs
done to them. There will be no difficulty in the management of this Action as a class action.
XI. PRESUMPTION OF RELIANCE
Plaintiffs are presumed to have relied on Defendants’ misrepresentations and
omissions under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine. At all times, the market for American’s
securities was an efficient market that promptly digested current information related to American
from all publicly available sources and reflected such information in the prices of American’s
securities. Throughout the Class Period:
i. American’s common stock was actively traded on the Nasdaq;
ii. The market price of American’s securities reacted promptly to the dissemination
of public information regarding the Company;
iii. American was followed by financial analysts, including those cited in this
Complaint;
iv. American securities maintained a high average weekly trading volume during the
Class Period;
v. As a regulated issuer, the Company filed with the SEC periodic public reports
during the Class Period;
vi. The Company regularly communicated with public investors via established
market communication mechanisms; and
vii. During the Class Period, American’s common stock had over 656,000,000 shares
outstanding, and its market capitalization was over 9,270,500,000 on April 25,
2024.
Throughout the Class Period, the Company was consistently followed by the
market, including securities analysts. The market relies upon the Company’s financial results and
management to accurately present the Company’s financial results. During this period, the
Company and the Individual Defendants continued to pump materially false and misleading
information into the marketplace regarding the Company and omitted material facts relevant to
American’s distribution strategy. This information was promptly reviewed and analyzed by
analysts and institutional investors and assimilated into the price of American’s securities.
As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, including Defendants’ false and
misleading statements and omissions, the market for American’s securities was artificially
inflated. Under such circumstances, the presumption of reliance available under the “fraud-on-
the-market” theory applies. Thus, Class members are presumed to have indirectly relied upon the
misrepresentations and omissions for which Defendants are responsible.
Plaintiffs and other Class members justifiably relied on the integrity of the market
price for American’s securities and were substantially damaged as a direct and proximate result
of their purchases of American’s securities at artificially inflated prices and the subsequent
decline in the price of those securities when the truth was disclosed.
Plaintiffs and the other Class members are also entitled to a presumption of
reliance under Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128 (1972) because claims
asserted in this Complaint against Defendants are predicated upon omissions of material fact for
which there was a duty to disclose.
Had Plaintiffs and other members of the Class known of the material adverse
information not disclosed by Defendants or otherwise been aware of the truth behind
Defendants’ material misstatements, they would not have purchased American’s securities at
artificially inflated prices.
XII. NO STATUTORY SAFE HARBOR
The statutory safe harbor provided for forward-looking statements under certain
circumstances does not apply to any of the allegedly false statements pleaded in this Complaint.
The statements alleged to be false and misleading herein all relate to then-existing facts and
conditions.
In addition, to the extent certain of the statements alleged to be false may be
characterized as forward looking, they were not identified as “forward-looking statements” when
made and there were no meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the purportedly forward-looking
statements.
In the alternative, to the extent that the statutory safe harbor is determined to
apply to any forward-looking statements pleaded herein, Defendants are liable for those false
forward-looking statements because at the time each of those forward-looking statements was
made, the speaker had actual knowledge that the forward-looking statement was materially false
or misleading, and/or the forward-looking statement was authorized or approved by an executive
officer of the Company who knew that the statement was false when made.
COUNT I
Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Promulgated Thereunder
Plaintiffs reallege each allegation as if fully set forth herein.
This claim is brought under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, against all
Defendants named herein.
During the Class Period, Defendants carried out a plan, scheme, and course of
conduct that was intended to and, throughout the Class Period, did: (i) deceive the investing
public, including Plaintiffs and other Class members, as alleged herein; (ii) artificially inflate and
maintain the market price of American’s securities; and (iii) cause Plaintiffs and other members
of the Class to purchase or otherwise acquire American’s securities at artificially inflated prices.
In furtherance of this unlawful scheme, plan, and course of conduct, the Defendants, and each of
them, took the actions set forth herein.
During the Class Period, Defendants, by the use of means and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce: (a) employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; (b) made untrue
statements of material fact and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made
not misleading; and (c) engaged in acts, practices and a course of business which operated as a
fraud and deceit upon Plaintiffs and the Class, all in an effort to maintain artificially high market
prices for American’s securities in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-
5 promulgated thereunder. Defendants acted individually and in concert in a continuous course
of conduct to conceal non-public, adverse material information about the Company’s outlook
and condition, as reflected in the misrepresentations and omissions set forth above.
During the Class Period, Defendants acted with scienter in that they knew that the
public documents and statements issued or disseminated in the name of the Company were
materially false and misleading; knew that such statements or documents would be issued or
disseminated to the investing public; and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced
in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary violations of the
securities laws. By virtue of their receipt of information reflecting the true facts of the Company,
their control over, and/or receipt and/or modification of the Company’s allegedly materially
misleading statements, and/or their associations with the Company which made them privy to
confidential proprietary information concerning the Company, Defendants participated in the
fraudulent scheme alleged herein.
The Individual Defendants, who are the senior officers and/or directors of the
Company, had actual knowledge of the material omissions and/or the falsity of the material
statements set forth above, and intended to deceive Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class,
or, in the alternative, acted with reckless disregard for the truth when they failed to ascertain and
disclose the true facts in the statements made by them, or other personnel of the Company to
members of the investing public, including Plaintiffs and the Class.
As a result of the foregoing, the market price of American’s securities was
artificially inflated during the Class Period. In ignorance of the fact that market prices of the
Company’s securities were artificially inflated, and relying directly or indirectly on the false and
misleading statements made by Defendants, or upon the integrity of the market in which the
securities trade, and/or in the absence of material adverse information that was known to or
recklessly disregarded by Defendants, but not disclosed in public statements by Defendants
during the Class Period, Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class purchased or otherwise
acquired American’s securities at artificially inflated prices and were damaged thereby.
Had Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class been aware that the market
price of American’s securities had been artificially and falsely inflated by the Company and the
Individual Defendants’ misleading statements and by the material adverse information which the
Company and the Individual Defendants did not disclose, they would not have purchased
American’s securities at the artificially inflated prices that they did, or at all.
As a result of the wrongful conduct alleged herein, Plaintiffs and the other
members of the Class have suffered damages in an amount to be established at trial. Plaintiffs
and the Class’s losses were proximately caused by Defendants’ scheme to defraud the investing
public by, among other things, failing to fully and accurately disclose to investors adverse
material information regarding the Company. Plaintiff and other members of the Class purchased
American’s securities in reliance on the integrity of the market price of the securities, and
Defendants manipulated the price of American’s securities through their misconduct as described
herein. Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s losses were a direct and foreseeable consequence of
Defendants’ concealment of, among other things, Defendants’ concealment of material facts
related to American’s distribution strategy.
By reason of the foregoing, Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and are liable to the Plaintiffs and the other
members of the Class for substantial damages which they suffered in connection with their
purchases of American’s securities during the Class Period.
COUNT II
Violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
Plaintiffs reallege each allegation as if fully set forth herein.
This claim is brought under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t,
against the Individual Defendants.
American and the Individual Defendants are liable as primary violators of Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 as set forth herein.
The Individual Defendants acted as controlling persons of the Company within
the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Because of their positions, the Individual
Defendants had the power and authority to cause the Company to engage in the wrongful
conduct complained of herein. By reason of such conduct, the Individual Defendants are liable
pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
Specifically, the Individual Defendants, by reason of their status as senior
executive officers and/or directors of the Company, directly or indirectly, controlled the conduct
of the Company’s business and their representations to Plaintiffs and the Class, within the
meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Individual Defendants directly or indirectly
controlled the content of the Company’s SEC filings, press releases and interviews with various
news sources cited herein related to Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s investments in American’s
securities within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, the Individual
Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the Company’s fraud, as alleged herein.
The Individual Defendants controlled and had the authority to control the content
of the Company’s SEC statements, press releases and other public statements. Because of their
close involvement in the everyday activities of the Company, and because of their wide-ranging
supervisory authority, the Individual Defendants reviewed or had the opportunity to review these
documents prior to their issuance or could have prevented their issuance or caused them to be
corrected.
The Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the
Company’s representations were materially false and misleading and/or omitted material facts
when made. In so doing, the Individual Defendants did not act in good faith.
By virtue of their high-level positions and their participation in and awareness of
the Company’s operations and public statements, the Individual Defendants were able to and did
influence and control the Company’s decision-making, including controlling the content and
dissemination of the documents that Plaintiffs and the Class contend contained materially false
and misleading information and on which Plaintiffs and the Class relied.
As set forth herein, the Individual Defendants each violated Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, thereunder, by their acts and omissions as alleged herein. By
virtue of their positions as controlling persons, the Individual Defendants are further liable
pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
As a direct and proximate result of the Individual Defendants’ wrongful conduct,
Plaintiffs and the Class suffered damages in connection with their purchase of American’s
securities.
