Lead Plaintiff Kim Kengle, as trustee of the Kim K. Kengle 2000 Trust
(“Lead Plaintiff”) and named plaintiff Roseanne Lacy (together with Lead Plaintiff,
“Plaintiffs” or “Investors”), individually and on behalf of all others similarly
situated, alleges the following based upon personal knowledge as to Investors’ own
acts and upon information and belief as to all other matters based on the
investigation conducted by and through Investors’ attorneys. This investigation
included, among other things: (1) review and analysis of U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings by Walmart, Inc. (“Walmart” or the
“Company”); (2) Walmart press releases and earnings call transcripts; public
information regarding Walmart, including information posted on the Walmart
website; analyst reports and media reports about Walmart, (3) documents filed in In
Re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, Case No. 1:17-md-2804 (N.D. Ohio)
(“Opioid MDL”); and (4) the complaint filed by the United States of America in
U.S. v. Walmart Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, 1:20-cv-01744-CFC (D. Del.)
(“DOJ Action”). Investors believes that substantial additional evidentiary support
will exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for
discovery.
NATURE OF THE ACTION
Investors bring this securities class action on behalf of all persons or
entities who purchased Walmart publicly traded common stock between March 31,
2017, and December 22, 2020, inclusive, (the “Class Period”) and who held such
shares on March 24, 2020, and/or December 22, 2020, and suffered compensable
damages thereby (the “Class”).
Investors bring this case because Walmart violated the Controlled
Substances Act (“CSA”) for over a decade and concealed from investors the
Government’s intensifying criminal and civil investigations into Walmart’s legal
violations. As Walmart’s internal documents prior to the Class Period acknowledge,
Walmart failed to comply with a secret 2011 settlement with the Drug Enforcement
Administration (“DEA”) and did not have a system to monitor suspicious orders of
opioids. As early as June 2014 Walmart acknowledged that it was “likely” that the
Company would therefore face “severe financial and reputational harm.”
As investors are now aware, in May 2018 the U.S. Attorney for the
Eastern District of Texas (“EDTX DOJ”) told Walmart that an indictment of the
Company was imminent. While the EDTX DOJ began its criminal investigation
(the “Criminal Investigation”) into Walmart in 2016, it was not until March 2020
that investors would learn that Walmart had been on the brink of indictment, and,
that while Walmart had seemingly escaped criminal prosecution, it was still the
subject of a DOJ civil investigation (“Civil Investigation,” together with the
Criminal Investigation, “Government Investigations” or “Investigations”) related to
Walmart’s dispensing and distributing opioids.
Then, in December 2020 the DOJ filed an enforcement action against
Walmart, laying bare the Company’s brazen misconduct and utter disregard of well-
established legal requirements under the CSA.
During the Class Period Defendants made false and misleading
statements that concealed the Government Investigations and the risks related to the
Company’s failure to comply with the CSA.
Defendants violated SEC regulations and Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that required the Company to disclose the
Government Investigations and the risks related to the Company’s opioid
dispensing and distribution business.
Defendants affirmatively represented in Walmart’s Class Period SEC
filings that it had disclosed all reasonably possible liabilities that may be material
even though Walmart never specifically disclosed the Government Investigations.
Further, in Walmart’s Class Period SEC filings Defendants set forth boilerplate
risks related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical,
risks that had already transpired related to Walmart’s pharmacy business.
Additionally, Walmart engaged in a PR campaign characterizing Walmart as a
“steward” in combatting the opioid crisis.
Walmart is the largest operator of discount retail stores in the United
States. In addition to a diverse assortment of retail offerings Walmart stores have
self-contained pharmacies. Accordingly, shoppers can fill prescriptions at nearly
5,000 Company-owned and operated retail pharmacies in the U.S. Indeed, Walmart
operates pharmacies to draw customers into its stores who then buy other non-
pharmacy goods.
Since 2011, Walmart’s 5,000 pharmacies nationwide, which dispense
prescription opioids and other controlled substances, have accounted for more than
10% of Walmart’s domestic net sales. In addition, until 2018, Walmart “self-
distributed” controlled substances which serviced Walmart’s own retail pharmacies
in the U.S.
Because Walmart dispensed and distributed controlled substances,
including highly addictive and dangerous Class II opioids, Walmart was subject to
the comprehensive but well-established requirements of the CSA and related
regulations.
The CSA required Walmart to implement reporting mechanisms and
controls designed to, inter alia, (i) identify and report to the DEA suspicious orders
of controlled substances; (ii) identify and investigate suspicious prescriptions (e.g.,
large, repeat orders from “pill-mill” doctors) and “refuse to fill” (“RTF”) such
orders; (iii) report RTF events to the DEA; (iv) provide internal reporting such that
Walmart pharmacists could identify red-flagged prescriptions across its nationwide
platform; and (v) prevent theft of controlled substances by Walmart employees.
Walmart’s failure to comply with the CSA prompted the DEA to take
nationwide action against it in 2009. In November 2009 the DEA issued an Order
to Show Cause seeking to revoke the registration of a Walmart in California to
dispense controlled substances.
To resolve the enforcement proceeding stemming from the 2009 Order
to Show Cause (“2009 OTSC”), and “avoid the uncertainty and expense of
litigation” Walmart and the DEA entered into a nationwide memorandum of
agreement in 2011 (“2011 MOA”).1 The 2011 MOA was for a four-year term, was
national in scope, and required Walmart to implement a variety of compliance
measures within no later than four years and maintain a robust compliance program
to ensure compliance with the CSA. The 2011 MOA essentially put Walmart on
probation.
Despite this, Walmart egregiously violated the 2011 MOA. As Brad
Nelson, a controlled substances compliance director at Walmart wrote in an email
to a regional manager less than a month before the MOA’s expiration: “The
MOA requires that the reporting of Refusal to fills expires in 30 days. We have not
invested a great amount of time and effort in doing analysis on the data since the
agreement is virtually over. Driving sales and patient awareness is a far better use
of our Market Directors and Market manager’s time.”
1 The 2011 MOA is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Indeed, in 2014, Walmart’s corporate compliance department
internally acknowledged, in a corporate governance “worksheet,” of which
Walmart’s board of directors was informed, that Walmart had “no processes in
place” to comply with its legal requirements to have a functioning suspicious order
monitoring system pursuant to the 2011 MOA and the CSA. The Company further
recognized that because of its CSA violations Walmart was “likely” to experience
“severe financial and reputational impact.” Then, in 2015, Walmart internally
acknowledged that its suspicious order monitoring system required “immediate and
substantial enhancements” to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of
non-compliance with [the CSA].”
Unsurprisingly, EDTX DOJ began a criminal investigation into
Walmart’s dispensing and distribution practices in December 2016. The Criminal
Investigation came after the DEA raided one of Walmart’s stores- a rare occurrence
for a Fortune 500 company.
The Criminal Investigation uncovered Walmart’s systematic CSA
violations. Walmart pharmacists from all over the country told the Company that
they did not want to fill prescriptions of opioids because they were from doctors
running pill mills. Customers in Texas had died after taking suspect prescriptions
that Walmart filled. Pharmacists pleaded with Walmart’s corporate office. Walmart
refused to take corporate-wide action. Instead, it provided bonuses to pharmacists
based on the number of prescriptions filled and pressured pharmacists to fill
prescriptions as quickly as possible.
On March 28, 2018, U.S. attorneys at EDTX DOJ informed Walmart
that it was going to indict the Company. In May 2018, EDTX DOJ told Walmart
that the indictment was imminent and that the Company should pay $1 billion to
settle the civil charges.
In the months that followed Walmart’s top lawyers met with EDTX
prosecutors. Walmart’s lawyers consulted Defendant McMillon who approved the
Company’s presentation to the DOJ wherein it attempted to convince the DOJ not
to indict Walmart. Walmart’s top outside counsel at Jones Day highlighted the
damage an indictment would cause to Walmart and its shareholders describing the
“profound negative impact on the lives and families of the Company’s 1.5 million
U.S. employees and its innocent shareholders. The decision to indict Walmart could
ultimately result in layoffs. It would also likely mean the loss of billions of dollars
in the value of Walmart shares held in retirement saving accounts for millions of
Americans and the pension funds of countless nonprofits and public employees.”
The U.S. Attorneys working on the Criminal Investigation
characterized Walmart’s pleas as no different than that of a criminal defendant who
pleads for leniency stating his children will be harmed by his incarceration. They
stated that Walmart’s size did not make it above prosecution.
According to federal prosecutors working on the case, Walmart
exploited its access to high level DOJ officials by lobbying to quash the
contemplated criminal indictment. Around the same time, Walmart hired Rachel
Brand, A DOJ official in Washington DC- to further influence the DOJ. Shortly
thereafter, DOJ leadership instructed the U.S. Attorney for EDTX to drop the
criminal indictment.
Notwithstanding the declination, of which Walmart was informed on
August 31, 2018, the Civil Investigation against the Company continued. According
to prosecutors, Walmart did not cooperate with the investigation. For example,
Walmart never gave prosecutors a full list of doctors that pharmacists were
concerned about; Walmart did not give prosecutors full information on its internal
databases to analyze prescribing information and patterns; and most importantly,
Walmart refused to produce emails between compliance officials and the
Company’s senior management.
Defendants concealed from Investors the existence of the Government
Investigations, as well as the 2009 OTSC and 2011 MOA.
On March 25, 2020 before the market opened, the Pulitzer-prize
winning investigative journalism news source ProPublica published a 7,500 word
expose disclosing for the first time that the EDTX DOJ had been criminally
investigating Walmart for violating the CSA and related laws since 2016. The article
revealed that in March 2018 Defendants became aware that EDTX DOJ intended to
indict the Company and that even after the DOJ declined to indict the Company it
remained the subject of an ongoing DOJ civil investigation. The article also revealed
that Walmart entered a secret settlement with the DEA in 2011 in which it agreed
to implement measures to comply with the CSA, and that Walmart had received
more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA from 2000 to 2018 for its
opioid prescribing practices. The article further revealed that Walmart did not
comply with the 2011 MOA, prompting the EDTX DOJ to pursue criminal charges
against the Company. The article noted that it was “troubling to the federal
investigators” that Walmart violated the CSA from 2011 to 2016, despite the fact
that “for much of this period, Walmart was operating under a secret
settlement…with the DEA” Indeed, “[p]rosecutors believed that Walmart was not
fulfilling the terms of its agreement with the DEA.”
On this news, shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share
from its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020, to its close at $109.40 on
March 25, 2020, damaging investors.
Then, on December 22, 2020, the DOJ announced that it had filed a
lawsuit against Walmart for alleged violations of the CSA. The DOJ’s complaint
alleges that from June 26, 2013 onward, Walmart “knowingly filled thousands of
controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical
purposes or in the usual course of medical practice, and that it filled prescriptions
outside the ordinary course of pharmacy practice.” The DOJ complaint also alleged
that, “as the operator of its distribution centers, which ceased distributing controlled
substances in 2018, Walmart received hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders
that it failed to report as required to by the DEA.” The DOJ stated that “these actions
helped to fuel the prescription opioid crisis.” The DOJ’s press release stated that it
sought civil penalties which “could total in billions” and injunctive relief.
On this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%,
over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020,
damaging investors.
Despite Defendants’ awareness of: (1) the 2011 MOA, (2) Walmart’s
CSA violations, (3) the EDTX DOJ’s Criminal Investigation and intent to indict the
Company, (4) the Civil Investigation and (5) Walmart’s own acknowledgment that
it was likely the Company would face severe financial and reputational damage
based on its CSA violations and failure to comply with the 2011 MOA, Defendants:
1) Misrepresented that they had disclosed all legal proceedings where a
liability is “reasonably possible” and “may be material,” despite having never
disclosed the Government Investigations (or the 2011 MOA);
2) violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles governing the
disclosure of contingent liabilities by failing to disclose the Government
Investigations as a contingent liability in Walmart’s Class Period financial
statements despite being aware that it was at least reasonably possible
(GAAP’s threshold requiring disclosure) that Walmart would incur a material
liability as a result of the Government Investigations;
3) violated Item 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.30
(“Item 103”) which requires disclosure of material legal proceedings known
to be contemplated by governmental authorities, by failing to disclose the
Government Investigations;
4) set forth boilerplate risk disclosures related to Walmart’s pharmacy
business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired
while concealing the Government Investigations; and
5) falsely portrayed Walmart as a “steward” in the opioid crisis with
“comprehensive policies and training to help support its pharmacists in filling
prescriptions only for legitimate medical reasons” when in truth Walmart’s
policies were specifically designed to prevent pharmacists from refusing to
fill illegitimate prescriptions.
Additionally, Defendants McMillon and Biggs issued false and
misleading Sarbanes Oxley certifications attesting to the accuracy of the Company’s
financial statements and statements in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports,
despite the violations of GAAP and SEC regulations and false statements described
above.
As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the decline
in the market value of the Company’s securities following a series of corrective
disclosures, Investors and other Class members suffered significant damages.

ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT
Introduction
A. Walmart’s Systematic Violations of the CSA
As detailed below, prior to and during the Class Period Walmart acted
as both a pharmacy that dispensed controlled substances and a distributor of
controlled substances to its own Walmart and Sam’s Club branded pharmacies. At
all relevant times, Walmart was subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (“Controlled Substances Act” or “CSA”).
Prior to and during the Class Period Walmart flagrantly violated the
CSA. On December 22, 2020, after conducting a “painstaking” investigation, the
United States Department of Justice filed a civil enforcement action against
Walmart in this Court. A copy of the complaint in the DOJ Action (“DOJ
Complaint”) is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein.
The DOJ Complaint alleges that “Walmart chose, for years, to
disregard a well-established legal obligation on a systematic basis and a huge scale
involving at least hundreds of thousands of orders of controlled substances. In doing
so, Walmart substantially benefitted itself while increasing the risk of undetected
unlawful conduct and serious widespread harm to Americans in the midst of a
nationwide prescription drug abuse epidemic.”
Walmart is also the subject of scores of civil lawsuits stemming from
its CSA violations, subjecting it to billions of dollars in liability and severe and
irreversible reputational damage.
Walmart is a defendant in a multidistrict litigation that thousands of
states, counties, cities, municipalities, and towns across the United States have
brought related to the opioid epidemic. See In re National Prescription Opiate
Litig., 17-md-02804 (N.D. Ohio) (“Opioid MDL” or “MDL”).
The Opioid MDL has been pending since December 1, 2017. On
January 27, 2020 the MDL Court denied Walmart’s motion for summary judgment
stating that:
“A jury could review the record evidence and find that Pharmacy
Defendants [including Walmart] shares a general conspiratorial
objective, with themselves and other Defendants, to expand the opioid
market using false information and disregarded regulatory
obligations in order to achieve that goal; and
“[T]he record evidence suggests obvious deficiencies that a layperson
could plainly recognize” in Walmart’s compliance program.
A copy of the MDL Court’s decision denying Walmart’s motion for summary
judgment is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
After the first bellwether trial in the Opioid MDL, which lasted six
weeks, on November 23, 2021 a jury found Walmart liable for helping fuel the
opioid crisis. (“Opioid Jury Verdict”). A copy of the Opioid Jury Verdict is attached
hereto as Exhibit D.
On August 17, 2022 the MDL Court issued an Abatement Order and
Injunction requiring Walmart to pay a penalty of $216,866,667 and undertake
numerous actions to comply with the CSA, including having an independent CSA
compliance monitor for a period of 15 years. A copy of the Abatement Order is
attached hereto as Exhibit E.
In connection with the Opioid MDL, the MDL Court permitted
plaintiffs to depose Defendant McMillon, finding evidence demonstrating
McMillon’s personal knowledge of and involvement in both Walmart’s opioid
compliance policies and the Criminal Investigation.
Specifically, in October 2016 McMillion bumped into a friend, Jerry
Jones, who had lost a son to opioids. McMillion asked Jones what Walmart could
do to help his “mission” of combatting the opioid crisis, making clear that he was
serious and not asking just to be polite. The Opioid MDL Court found that “there
are emails showing suggestions Jones made to McMillon, and McMillon
forwarding those ideas to other Walmart executives.” Additionally, the MDL Court
found that “plaintiffs also offer evidence and colorable argument that McMillon has
personal knowledge about PowerPoint presentations made by Walmart’s counsel to
the Department of Justice…and there is evidence that McMillon was consulted
during the formulation and approval of Walmart’s response to the DOJ
investigation.” A copy of the MDL Court’s Ruling Regarding Deposition of
Walmart CEO McMillion is attached hereto as Exhibit F.
B. Walmart’s CSA Obligations as a Pharmacy and a Distributor of
Controlled Substances
Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Pub. L. No.
91-513, tit. II, 84 Stat. 1236, 1242-84 (1970) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. §§
801-904), in 1970 to, among other things, “provide meaningful regulation over
legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels.”
The CSA creates a category of drugs, known as “controlled
substances,” that are subject to strict federal monitoring based on their potential for
abuse.2
The CSA comprehensively regulates every participant in the supply
chain for controlled substances, from manufacturers to wholesale distributors to
retail pharmacies. Because controlled substances, by definition, are drugs with the
potential for abuse, this comprehensive scheme is designed to prevent the
“diversion”—i.e., the illegal misuse—of controlled substances, including
prescription opioids. Under the CSA, every participant in the supply chain bears
responsibility for preventing the misuse of controlled substances.3
Controlled substances are grouped into five categories. Schedule II
controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, which, if abused, “may lead

currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently
accepted medical use with severe restrictions.” Schedule II includes opioid-based
painkillers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, and stimulants such
as amphetamine.4

4 See 21 C.F.R. § 1308.12; DOJ Complaint ¶57.
Any person who manufacturers, distributes or dispenses a controlled
substance must register, and maintain registration, with the DEA.
The CSA requires distributors of controlled substances to “design and
operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled
substances,” and “shall inform” DEA of those suspicious orders “when discovered.”
See 21 C.F.R. § 1301.74(b). Thus, a distributor must itself detect and identify
suspicious orders and report them to DEA. This requirement protects against
diversion and abuse by requiring distributors to monitor pharmacies for warning
signs of such misconduct.5
Suspicious orders “include orders of unusual size, orders deviating
substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.” In other
words, orders that are unusual in one or more of those three ways—size, pattern, or
frequency—are deemed “suspicious orders,” and a distributor must detect and
report them. The regulation does not limit “suspicious orders” to those three
categories, however. It states, non-exclusively, that suspicious orders “include”
those categories.6
Because Walmart acted as its own distributor for controlled substances
(up until November 2017), it had a special advantage: Walmart had access to

extensive data and other information that gave it the ability—had it wanted to—to
investigate the circumstances underlying orders for controlled substances.
Walmart was subject to numerous requirements under the CSA as a
pharmacy dispensing controlled substances. These requirements are specifically
enumerated in the DOJ Complaint.7
A registrant who dispenses a drug issued without a valid prescription
may be subject to civil penalties or, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties.8
The CSA also authorizes the Attorney General to seek declaratory and injunctive
relief for such violations of law.9 21 U.S.C. § 843(f).
Part 1306 of the CSA has three rules that pharmacists must follow. A
pharmacist must first determine that the prescription was issued by a licensed
medical practitioner in the usual course of their practice; the pharmacist must next
determine that the prescription is for a legitimate medical purpose; and finally, the
pharmacist must adhere to the usual course of their own practice in filling the
prescription. Walmart, as a pharmacy, was bound by these rules.
Pharmacists are not permitted under law to rely exclusively on the fact
that a prescription was issued by a licensed medical professional in determining
whether a prescription is valid. Pharmacists are instead required to consider “red

flags” when they appear and when their appearance brings into question the validity
of a prescription which a medical professional has issued. Such “red flags” include,
but are not limited to, a medical professional who issues large quantities of
controlled substances- for example a doctor who issues prescriptions for opioids in
large quantities to large numbers of patients; prescriptions which are themselves
dangerous- for example certain combinations of drugs which are known to be
susceptible to abuse and/or dangerous in combination; and the circumstances of the
patient themselves- for example a customer who the pharmacist knows always
refills their large opioid prescriptions well before the individual should have used
up the previous supply of pills from an earlier prescription.
If the pharmacist cannot resolve the red flag, the pharmacist must
refuse to fill the prescription. If the pharmacist can resolve the red flag the
pharmacist must document its resolution. A lack of documentation is evidence that
the pharmacist did not resolve the red flag.
Violations of the CSA’s dispensing rules are subject to civil penalties
not to exceed $25,000 for each violation on or before November 2, 2015, and not to
exceed $67,627 for each violation after November 2, 2015.10
10 See 21 U.S.C. § 842(c)(1)(A); 28 C.F.R. § 85.5; DOJ Complaint ¶93.
Distributors of controlled substances are also required to abide by
certain legal obligations when they receive controlled substance orders from
pharmacies.11
Distributors are required to register with the DEA and maintain
effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances.12
A distributor is required to design and operate a system to detect
suspicious orders of controlled substances and inform the DEA of suspicious orders.
Failing to detect and report a suspicious order is a violation of the law. The civil
penalty associated with such violation is up to $10,000 for each violation on or
before November 2, 2015 and up to $15,691 for each violation after November 2,
2015.13
C. The Opioid Crisis
In the late 1990’s pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical
community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers and
healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. Based on these
assurances from the pharmaceutical industry and industry sponsored doctors and
medical foundations, doctors even began prescribing opioids to children.
11 DOJ Complaint ¶¶96-104.
12 Id. ¶98.
13 Id. ¶104.
Increased prescription of opioid medications led to widespread abuse
and addiction, making it clear that opioids could in fact be highly addictive.
In 2017 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared
the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Between 1999 and 2018, more than
232,000 people in the United States died from overdoses involving prescription
opioids. Two out of three drug overdose deaths in 2018 involved an opioid.14 In
2019, an estimated 10.1 million people aged 12 or older had misused opioids in the
past year.15
An estimated 40% of opioid overdose deaths involved a prescription
opioid. Some individuals who filled invalid prescriptions for controlled substances
at Walmart died soon thereafter of overdoses related to those prescriptions.16
Walmart As a Pharmacy Violated the CSA Prior to and Throughout the
Class Period and Designed its Opioid Sales Operations to Prioritize
Profits and Disregard Legal Compliance
The DOJ Complaint states that from June 26, 2013 to the present,
“Walmart violated the CSA’s dispensing rules on a sweeping national scale, filling
enormous amounts of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions” due to
“Walmart’s failure to take seriously its duty to comply with the CSA obligations

and [ ] the ways Walmart made it difficult for its pharmacists to fulfill those
obligations.”17
Walmart’s pharmacy operations are part of the company’s Health and
Wellness Division. The Health and Wellness Division included a compliance team,
located at Walmart’s Corporate Headquarters, that was responsible for ensuring that
pharmacy operations complied with all relevant federal and state laws. This
compliance unit included managers who fielded questions about legal compliance
from Walmart’s agents in the field, including pharmacists and distribution center
staff. Walmart’s Health and Wellness compliance unit helped develop Walmart’s
internal controlled substances guidance and procedure documents.18
Walmart’s compliance unit oversaw nationwide dispensing practices.
Walmart pharmacies were staffed by a pharmacy manager, line pharmacists and
pharmacy technicians. Pharmacy managers reported to market directors, who
oversaw multiple Walmart pharmacies. These market directors in turn reported to
market managers, who were responsible for multiple areas of operation.19

Walmart’s pharmacies ultimately reported to Walmart corporate
executives in Walmart’s Health and Wellness Division located at Walmart’s
corporate headquarters.20
Walmart knew that many of the controlled-substance prescriptions it
filled were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose or in the usual course of
medical practice or both. Walmart became aware of this through several ways.
First, Walmart pharmacists repeatedly identified problem or “pill-mill”
prescribers. Walmart pharmacists submitted these “refusal-to-fill” forms (“RFTs”)
identifying pill-mill prescribers to Walmart’s corporate compliance unit who
oversaw nationwide dispensing practices. Second, Walmart pharmacists were
aware that certain prescriptions showed obvious red flags and were therefore
indicative of prescription drug abuse. Third, Walmart pharmacists would sometimes
refuse to fill prescriptions because they were obviously illegal and presented
unresolved red flags. Those same prescriptions would then later be filled by a
different Walmart pharmacist who would fill the prescription without resolving the
red flag.21
Walmart intentionally impeded its pharmacists’ ability to comply with
the law so that it could attract and retain customers.
20 Id. ¶¶108, 113.
21 DOJ Complaint ¶¶108-112.
Retailers like Walmart operate pharmacies to draw customers in to buy
other non-pharmacy goods. For example, Walmart’s annual reports since at least
2017 have stated that risks to its pharmacy business could “result in the loss of cross-
store or club selling opportunities, and in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales,
other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.”22 Additionally, Walmart’s
Sam’s Club stores sometimes offered drastic discounts on opioids to drive customer
traffic to its stores.23
To attract pharmacy customers to its stores, Walmart collaborated with
McKesson to make trial offers, savings cards, and e-coupons to promote discount
opioids including OxyContin, Butrans, Hyslinga, Ultram ER, Magnacet and
Nucynta. Walmart and CVS alone handled 49% of all claims for the Magnacet
loyalty program. Walmart was in the top four of pharmacies for amount of claims
in the Nucynta loyalty program.24

Walmart also agreed to partner on direct mail campaigns to sell
Butrans on behalf of Purdue Pharma, using Walmart’s prescription data to reach
prior buyers of these products to encourage them to seek more prescriptions.25
Walmart pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions as quickly as
possible because “shorter wait times keep patients in store.” Walmart managers told
pharmacists to “[h]ustle to the customer, hustle from station to station” because
filling prescriptions “is a battle of seconds.”26
Managers ranked stores for the volume of prescriptions filled. Walmart
Health and Wellness Directors set the unrealistic goal for pharmacists to fill
prescriptions in less than 15 minutes. In 2013 Walmart adopted “Pharmacy
Facilities Management Incentive Plans” providing monetary incentives to
employees based on the number of prescriptions the store’s pharmacy filled.27
Walmart’s pharmacy incentive plan provided bonus payments based
on number of prescriptions filled regardless of whether the sales were generated
from sales of controlled substance. As the number of prescriptions went up so did
the incentive payments Walmart awarded its employees. A Management Incentive
Plan (“MIP”) bonus provided additional payments to eligible associates based on
the extent to which the number of annual prescriptions exceeded 190,000. The MIP

made no mention or patient safety goals or red flag detection goals. These programs
disincentivized pharmacists from exercising their professional judgment in
protecting against illegal diversion of controlled substances and instead emphasized
speed and profits.28
Walmart also advocated with the National Associated of Chain Drug
Stores (“NACDS”) DEA Compliance Working Group to include controlled
substances within the pharmacist incentive programs, insisting that “[i]ncentive
programs should be entirely agnostic as to the type of prescriptions (controlled
substances or non-controlled substance drugs) filled.” Walmart disagreed with
NACDS proposal for identifying a red flag for “[e]xcessive volume and rate of
growth of dispensing controlled substances.29
Walmart’s compliance department threatened pharmacists if they did
not fill prescriptions despite obvious signs of illegality. For example, on January 8,
2015, Walmart Compliance Director Brad Nelson discussed a pharmacist who had
reported “that he is feeling pressured” by his supervisor to fill prescriptions of
controlled substances despite obvious signs of illegality, explaining that if the
pharmacist doesn’t fill prescriptions, “then that would be a significant issue.”

29 Lembke Report at 114.
Indeed, Walmart conducted surveys of its pharmacy employees in June
2012, July 2014 and October 2014. The survey results evidence that pharmacists
felt rushed when filling prescriptions, felt that the pharmacies were understaffed,
and felt that patient safety was undermined as a result. Many employees responded
to the surveys with specific pleas indicating that they felt at risk for making mistakes
and unsafely filling prescriptions for Class II controlled substances. For example,
one employee responded to the October 2014 survey stating: “Since … new Control
Class II Change for Hydrocodone we have been added more responsibility and time-
consuming tasks, but our allotted hours for pharmacy staff has not changed….
[T]his can add to pharmacy staff being more rushed to fill Rx, therefore more chance
of mistakes happening in the pharmacy.” One comments states: “Our [District
Manager] continually sends our pharmacy nasty emails and chastises us for not
having a [sic] high enough numbers in our input and fill accuracy and times. We are
therefore instructed to cheat the system ….” Another comment states: “[B]ecause
of the constant harassment from our market manager about us not getting
[prescriptions] done in 20 min, we often take shortcuts in filling and counseling rx’s
that could lead to patient safety issues.”30
30 DOJ Complaint ¶¶121-22.
A. Walmart Was Well Aware of Its Legal Obligations under the
CSA, as Evidenced by Its Internal Policies and the 2011 MOA,
Which Walmart Flagrantly Violated
Walmart acknowledged that it had to comply with the CSA’s
requirements when dispensing controlled substances. Walmart maintained a
Pharmacy Operations Manual (“POM”) which serves as a central resource for its
pharmacies. In 2009 Walmart added a policy to its POM which, according to a
Walmart Senior Director of Pharmacy Professional Services and Government
Relations, “provides guidance on the pharmacist’s responsibility to ensure that a
prescription has been issued for a valid purpose….” The policy thus would serve as
a “reference for pharmacists regarding,” among other things, “‘prescription mills.’”
Walmart’s POM listed and identified criteria for determining when a proper patient
prescriber relationship might not exist. Walmart even revised its POM to add more
details concerning red flags of illegality.31
In April 2015, as the opioid crisis in the U.S. continued to escalate,
Walmart again amended its POM, specifically quoting the CSA and explaining that
the regulation requiring pharmacists to dispense controlled-substance prescriptions
that were written for a legitimate medical purpose and a proper prescriber patient
relationship was the basis for nearly all criminal actions the DEA took against
31 Id. ¶¶125-131.
pharmacies and pharmacists. The amendment even listed the red flags the DEA
identified, listing 18 red flags in total and encompassing prescriber red flags, patient
red flags and prescription red flags.32
Defendants obtained a heightened awareness of their obligations under
the CSA in March 2011 when Walmart entered into a secret nationwide settlement
agreement (“2011 MOA”) to resolve a DEA administrative action. The
administrative action came after the DEA discovered major dispensing violations at
a California Walmart and issued an Order to Show Cause (“2009 OTSC”).
The 2011 MOA, (discussed further in ¶¶187-196 below), bound all
Walmart stores for four years and required the Company to maintain an adequate
compliance program to detect and prevent diversion of controlled substances. Given
the escalating opioid crisis, the consequences for potentially violating the CSA, and
the seriousness of the allegations leading up to the 2011 MOA, the Individual
Defendants would have undoubtedly been aware of the 2011 MOA. The 2011 MOA
was signed by Walmart Senior Vice President and head of Health & Wellness John
O. Agwunobi, and King & Spaulding Partner Catherine M. O’Neill, each of whom
“represent[ed] and warrant[ed] that they [we]re authorized by Walmart to execute
this Agreement.”33
32 Id. ¶¶133-34.
33 2011 MOA (Exhibit A hereto), at pages 1-2, 6-7.
Walmart flagrantly violated the 2011 MOA. It did not adopt a robust
compliance program. And while it gathered information from pharmacists
concerning red flags of diversion, it took an approach that intentionally denied
pharmacists information necessary to comply with the CSA’s dispensing
obligations.
To be sure, Walmart maintained extensive prescription and dispensing
data. Pharmacists sent red flag reports to Walmart’s compliance unit in RFTs or
other direct communications. In many instances pharmacists could tell that a
prescription was invalid just by looking at the identity of the prescriber, e.g., where
the prescriber continually wrote prescriptions for massive amounts of narcotics and
operated “basically a walk-in pain clinic” or prescribed dangerous “cocktails” of
drugs.34
Pharmacists sent these reports directly to a central email address which
a senior compliance manager in Walmart’s Health and Wellness Division
monitored. The compliance manager then gathered this information into
spreadsheets. These spreadsheets contained important information. Through these
spreadsheets Walmart’s compliance unit could quickly spot which prescribers were
“pill-mills” and which patients were doctor or pharmacy shoppers. But Walmart
refused to share this important information with Walmart pharmacists, the on-
34 DOJ Complaint ¶¶142-165; 486-495.
ground personnel who needed it. And while Walmart sometimes sent “refusal-to-
fill” forms to the DEA as the MOA mandated, when it did so it removed the
pharmacists’ comments which contained the important information necessary for
the DEA to prosecute these prescribers and stop diversion.35
By withholding necessary information to detect diversion, and
requiring pharmacists to fill prescriptions in an unreasonable amount of time,
Walmart intentionally enabled its pharmacists to fill illegal prescriptions, fueling
the opioid crisis. And even when a Walmart pharmacist would refuse to fill a
prescription a customer could just go to another Walmart pharmacy where it would
most likely get filled. Walmart’s compliance unit was aware of this. For example,
in May 2014, a Walmart Market Health and Wellness Director emailed a senior
manager in Walmart’s compliance unit stating: “these patients and prescriptions
will simply move to another location and I was hoping we had a process for flagging
doctors that are under investigation so all locations are aware?” The senior
compliance manager responded: “[t]here is no communication we can put out.”
Indeed, in 2013 one former Walmart pharmacist (“Whistleblower”)
filed a whistleblower (which remained under seal until December 2018) in which
he alleged that Walmart fired him directly in retaliation for notifying local police
35 DOJ Complaint ¶¶145-151.
and the DEA of suspicious prescriptions.36 On August 24, 2012 the Whistleblower
contacted Walmart’s “Executive Open Door Services” to “lodge his concerns
regarding illegal controlled substances prescriptions” and sent an e-mail to
Walmart’s top management including then-CEO Michael Duke and Chairman of
Walmart’s Board of Directors Robson Walton.37 The Whistleblower alleged that
within a one and a half-month window between July 14 and August 30, 2012, he:
-Saw Walmart pharmacists fill prescriptions bearing red flags of
illegality and did not meet proper record requirements under the CSA,
were “indicative of illegal diversion activities,” and “did not meet the
legal requirements necessary for a pharmacist to fill them”;38
-Received significant pushback from Health & Wellness regarding his
whistleblower claims;39 and
-Knew that “illegal controlled substance prescriptions were being
filled [by Walmart pharmacists] from at least 2007 to July 2012.”40
Defendant McMillon was a member of Walmart’s Executive
Committee at the time the Whistleblower Complaint was filed and would have
learned about the Whistleblower Complaint.

The Whistleblower later told NPR that despite notifying his bosses as
well as Walmart’s corporate headquarters that based on the illegitimate
prescriptions he was receiving Walmart’s pharmacies were feeding a black market
for opioids, Walmart pressured him to “just be quiet and not to say anything more.”
He further stated that he was told: “do not reach out to the DEA, do not call the
police. If you do so, your employment is going to be terminated.” Walmart first
reassigned, and then terminated the Whistleblower. 41
Walmart’s compliance unit recognized that pharmacists could not
obtain the necessary information about red flags they needed to comply with the
CSA. In 2013, a Walmart “Controlled Substances Work Group” reported that it
needed to “[e]stablish a process for the analysis of refusal to fill data and reporting
problematic prescribers or patients internally.”42
Walmart never did this, even up until now. As the DOJ Complaint
states “even as of recently, Walmart still had not adopted a system that affirmatively
alerts pharmacists, in some way, to the critical red-flag information in a manner that
enables its pharmacists to comply with their legal duties. At the same time, Walmart

has continued to tout on its website how it has used its pharmacy data to “enhance,
customize and optimize the shopping experience” and to “make Walmart
pharmacies more efficient.”43
Evidence in the Opioid MDL confirms Walmart’s failure to make
refusal-to-fill/red flag information easily accessible to all pharmacists who might
need it. In an e-mail admitted as an exhibit in the Opioid MDL, dated July 29, 2018,
Jacob Creel, Director, U.S. Ethics and Compliance, Health and Wellness Practice
Compliance explained:
Currently, in the pharmacies, if the pharmacist makes a professional
judgment, based on identified red flags, to not fill a prescription for
controlled substances, the pharmacist submits a refusal to fill form in
Archer. These forms are collected and stored in Archer. However,
pharmacists do not have easy access to this information, especially if
the pharmacist is from a different store. This information could be
used to clear red flags, or identify red flags that may indicate the
prescription was not issued for a legitimate medical reason. In order to
ensure the pharmacist is equipped to make the most appropriate
decision, this information needs to be readily accessible.44
Walmart’s senior executives were aware of this. The above-quoted
email states that “[t]his project is a priority of Rachel Brand, Executive Vice-
President of Global Governance and Corporate Secretary.”45

Rather than comply with its legal obligations under the CSA and the
terms of the MOA Walmart elected to focus on increasing sales. Walmart
compliance director Brad Nelson told a vice president in Health and Wellness
Operations that during the MOA, the compliance unit had “not invested a great
amount of effort into data analysis.” He stated that “[d]riving sales and patient
awareness” was “a far better use of our Market Directors and Market Manager’s
time.”46
B. Walmart Prohibited Pharmacists from Categorically Refusing to
Fill Prescriptions Issued by Pill-Mill Prescribers and Kept Filling
Illegal Prescriptions Issued by Known Pill-Mill Prescribers
Even when pharmacists determined a prescriber was running a “pill-
mill47” Walmart refused to allow the pharmacist to categorially refuse to fill
prescriptions that prescriber wrote. Walmart’s insistence that a pharmacist consider
each individual prescription despite this, coupled with the stringent time pressures
Walmart placed on its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, caused pharmacists to fill
illegal prescriptions.
Between at least 2012 and 2017 Walmart’s controlled substance
compliance department prohibited pharmacists from exercising their professional
46 DOJ Complaint ¶159.
47 A “pill mill” is an operation in which a doctor, clinic, or pharmacy prescribes
and/or dispenses narcotics such as opiate prescription drugs without a legitimate
medical purpose.
judgment in refusing to fill prescriptions by prescribers clearly operating “pill
mills.” In the Opioid MDL, Regional Compliance Director for Controlled
Substances Brad Nelson testified that it was Walmart’s policy throughout this time
period of not permitting blanket refusals to fill.
Despite pharmacists repeatedly raising concerns up the chain about
their inability to control prescriptions from pill mills, Walmart’s Health & Wellness
Compliance provided them with identical guidance, instructing that “no blanket
refusals are allowed by the Boards of Pharmacy. I believe these prescription[s]
fall into this category”48 regardless of the severity of the red flags that they raised
or whether the state in question actually prohibited such refusals.49
As the DOJ Complaint details, even after Walmart pharmacists
informed its compliance unit about pill-mill prescribers whose practices raised
egregious red flags, Walmart continued to fill invalid prescriptions those prescribers
issued. The DOJ Complaint sets forth in painstaking detail 20 examples of
prescribers whose illegal prescribing practices Walmart knew about. In each
example, Walmart pharmacists recognized, and reported to Walmart’s compliance
unit, that a particular prescriber was issuing prescriptions with no legitimate medical
purpose or outside the usual course of professional practice. As the DOJ Complaint

49 DOJ Complaint ¶174.
states: “In each example, Walmart’s compliance unit knew that its pharmacists were
continuing to be presented with prescriptions issued by those prescribers, and that,
based on the reported red flags, there was a very high probability that the prescribers
were regularly issuing invalid controlled-substance prescriptions.”50
“In each example, despite possessing this knowledge of red flags,
Walmart’s compliance unit withheld from pharmacists the detailed information the
compliance unit had compiled. Nor did Walmart give its pharmacists the time,
guidance, and tools they needed to prevent the filling of further invalid
prescriptions. Rather, in each example, despite Walmart’s knowledge of
prescriber red flags indicating a very high probability that the prescriber regularly
issued invalid prescriptions for controlled substances, Walmart continued to fill
hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of prescriptions by the same problem
prescriber.”51
The twenty examples set forth in the DOJ Complaint are shocking and
disturbing.52 Walmart’s illegal dispensing practices and knowledge thereof set forth
in these examples spans from June 2012 through August 2018. These 20 examples
50 Id. ¶178.
51 Id. ¶179.
52 Id. ¶¶180-356.
are a sample of the numerous prescribers whose egregious and illegal prescribing
practices were known to Walmart.53
Most notorious among these is the case of Dr. Howard Diamond, who
pled guilty and received a 20-year sentence for the improper prescribing of opioids.
Walmart’s compliance department first became aware of Diamond in February
Diamond was not subject to a corporate block until March 2017 despite
repeated requests from pharmacists to Walmart’s compliance department with
concerns regarding Diamond’s prescriptions. One Walmart pharmacy manager
wrote: “filling for him is a risk that keeps me up at night.” Despite many emails to
compliance about Diamond, Brad Nelson wrote “[r]emember, we are not allowed
to blanket refuse to fill for any prescriber.” In total, Walmart filled 14,700 controlled
substance prescriptions Diamond wrote, amounting to over 1.5 million doses over
a six-year period.54
In another example, a Walmart pharmacist observed that 95% of the
prescriptions from the prescriber were for controlled substances. Despite this,
Walmart filled more than 650 controlled substance prescriptions that he wrote. This
doctor’s license was ultimately suspended. In one example, the doctor in question
had been banned by other pharmacies and wrote a dangerously high dose for a
53 Id. ¶178.
54 Id. ¶¶ 228, 237, 239.
controlled substance, writing on the prescription itself as the reason for prescribing
“that’s what the patient wants.” Nevertheless, Walmart filled 6,500 prescriptions
the prescriber issued.55
In another example, a concerned pharmacy manager wrote the
following about a doctor whose was obviously issuing illegal prescriptions:
““[D]epending on how long it might take co[r]porate to decide on what to do, we
might start to refuse to fill prescriptions for some patients. I have too much invested
in my career and family to continue to risk it.” When Walmart compliance
manager Brad Nelson received this email, he explained that he was aware that
prescriptions from problematic prescribers would continue to be presented to
Walmart pharmacists because “the traffic [to Sam’s Clubs] and routines of these
patients have already been established” by the “drastic” discounts that Sam’s Club
once offered for oxycodone.56 Indeed, Walmart offered drastic discounts on opioids
to customers in Sam’s Club stores and repeatedly told pharmacists to fill
prescriptions as quickly as possible, because “shorter wait times keep patients in
store.57” These efforts were in furtherance of Walmart’s goal of “driving sales” by
attracting shoppers to Walmart who came in to fill opioid prescriptions and then
purchased other non-pharmacy goods.
55 Id. ¶¶180-84.
56 Id. ¶¶212-226.
57 Id. ¶¶115, 219.
Pharmacy managers explicitly warned Walmart that filling these
prescriptions was illegal. In just one example, in October 2015, a pharmacy
associate sent an email concerning a doctor who ran a “known pill mill” and was
then subject to three Department of Health administrative actions stating, “this is
something that should be looked into before the DEA comes knocking on our
door.” This email was forwarded to a Market Health and Wellness Director, a
Corporate Compliance Director, a Controlled Substances Director, and Brad
Nelson, also a Director of Corporate Compliance.58
Of the twenty examples the DOJ Complaint describes many involve
doctors who were charged with federal crimes and/or whose medical licenses were
revoked. In most instances Walmart filled illegal prescriptions these doctors wrote
numbering in the thousands. In all instances pharmacists and other Walmart
personnel warned Walmart’s Corporate compliance department about these
“doctors’” illegal and dangerous prescribing practices multiple times over the
course of a period that spanned years. Nevertheless, Walmart did nothing, in
violation of its known legal obligations.59
58 Id. ¶272.
59 Id. ¶¶178-383.
C. Walmart Filled Prescriptions Showing Glaring Red Flags of
Illegality on Their Face
Walmart pharmacists also dispensed numerous controlled-substance
prescriptions exhibiting, on their face, red flags—including the dose or amount
prescribed, combination of drugs, or prescribing pattern—that Walmart pharmacists
would have easily recognized as indicating a high probability that the prescriptions
were invalid. But on numerous occasions, Walmart pharmacists filled the
prescriptions without resolving the red flags. For example, Walmart’s compliance
unit repeatedly found that prescriptions showing obvious red flags had been filled
with no documentation by the pharmacist that the red flags had been resolved.60
Indeed, Walmart’s own POM recognized that prescriptions can show
obvious red flags on their face when they are “presented in a combination that can
cause medical complications” or are “for an unusually large quantity or high starting
dose.”
Because Walmart’s pharmacists were under enormous pressure to fill
prescriptions quickly and received little training prior to 2018 on how to handle
prescriptions raising red flags they frequently failed to resolve any red flags before
filling the prescription.61
60 DOJ Complaint ¶¶357-59.
61 Id. ¶¶357, 115-122.
While Walmart had the ability in its compliance software to set “edits”
to automatically alert a pharmacist if a prescription contained red flags, it did not
design its software to do this.62
The DOJ Complaint sets forth in detail the various “red flags” and how
Walmart repeatedly filled prescriptions that on their face presented these obvious
red flags.63
One example of these facial red flags is multiple prescriptions for
immediate release opioids for the same person. By filling duplicative prescriptions
for multiple immediate-release opioids, Walmart dispensed, in some cases, opioids
that had a sum total morphine milligram equivalent (“MME,” a measure of the
potency of a dose of opioids) that reached dangerous levels. This not only increased
the risk of an overdose but could also signal that the pills were being diverted to
persons other than the patient (such as for illegal sale). Nevertheless, between June
2013 and June 2018, Walmart pharmacists filled thousands of prescriptions for
multiple immediate-release opioids for the same person, on the same day or close
in time, in some cases for not only two but three or more immediate-release drugs.64
A prescription for dangerous “cocktails” of opioids and non-opioids is
another red flag. Walmart’s POM recognized that red flags include prescriptions
62 Id. ¶358.
63 Id. ¶¶361-426.
64 Id. ¶¶363-383
“that represent a ‘cocktail’ of commonly abused drugs.” A compliance unit director
explained in an internal email in February 2016 that “[a] cocktail is a red flag that
should alert the [pharmacist] to use their professional judgment to refuse to fill the
[prescription].” These combinations increase euphoric effects but also increase the
risk of abuse and overdose. Walmart pharmacists filled thousands of prescriptions
that fall into four distinct “trinity” categories of combinations of opioid/non-opioid
prescriptions that on their face presented an obvious red flag as to the prescriptions’
validity.65 Each category was known to be popular among individuals who were
abusing or misusing prescription drugs.
Between June 2013 through the date the DOJ filed its Complaint in
December 2020, Walmart filled thousands of prescriptions comprising dangerous
“trinity” combinations, many of which had additional red flags. For example,
hundreds of these prescriptions were paid for in cash and hundreds were for a patient
in a different state than the prescriber, signaling that the patient and the doctor did
not have a legitimate relationship.66
65 DOJ Complaint ¶¶384-85. These categories consist of the “classic trinity,” the
“zopidem trinity,” the “stimulant trinity,” and the “trinity plus.” For example, the
stimulant trinity, (also called the “blackout trinity”) consists of: a) an opioid, b) a
benzodiazepine, and c) a stimulant. This combination is dangerous, given that the
effects of the stimulant may lead the user to overdose in an effort to achieve the
desired euphoria. Id. ¶¶ 387, 391, 394, 401.
66 Id. ¶¶384-408
Another red flag is repeated fills of very high dosages of opioids.
Walmart’s POM recognized that prescriptions presented red flags if they were “for
an unusually large quantity starting at a high dose.” Nevertheless, from June 2013
through the date of the DOJ Complaint, Walmart filled numerous high dose
prescriptions. Many of them contained additional red flags such as being paid for in
cash, were for a patient in a different state than the prescriber or were written by
prescribers running known pill-mills.67
Another red flag is unusually early refills for Schedule II controlled
substances. Refilling a prescription for a controlled-substance significantly early-
i.e. before the patient should have exhausted the prior months’ supply- signals abuse
or diversion. In such cases, the individual is likely taking a higher quantity of the
drug than prescribed or diverting some of the pills to others.
Walmart’s own policy recognized that early refills could signal abuse.
Despite this, from June 2013 through the date the DOJ filed its Complaint, Walmart
filled thousands of these prescriptions early. These prescriptions were filled so early
that they indicate that Walmart pharmacists would have known that substantially all
of them were illegitimate.68
67 Id. ¶¶409-415.
68 Id. ¶¶422-426.
Walmart Violated the CSA in its Role as A Distributor of Controlled
Substances
21 C.F.R. § 1301.74(b) requires distributors of controlled substances
to design and operate a system to detect suspicious orders of controlled substances
and to report those suspicious orders to the DEA. Suspicious order monitoring is
referred to as “SOM.”
Walmart acted as a distributor of controlled substances, delivering
large shipments to its pharmacies throughout the U.S. Walmart violated the CSA
“at least hundreds of thousands of times” by failing to design and operate a system
to detect and report suspicious orders to the DEA. Suspicious orders include, but
are not limited to, orders that are unusual in size, pattern, or frequency.
From 2000 to approximately May 2018 Walmart self-distributed tens
of millions of shipments of controlled substances to its own Walmart and Sam’s
Club pharmacies. Walmart operated at least six distribution centers in various states.
Only one distribution center, located in Bentonville Arkansas, distributed Schedule
II controlled substances.69
69 DOJ Complaint ¶¶481-82.
From 2012 to 2018, Walmart was the largest self-distributor in the
country for oxycodone, hydromorphone, and hydrocodone in terms of both dosage
units and grams.70
Walmart had access to a wealth of data such that it could readily have
designed a system to adequately detect suspicious orders. Walmart had data about
individuals who filled prescriptions at its pharmacies, information about the
prescribers, and reports from its own pharmacists who raised concerns.71
Walmart also had the ability to use sophisticated data analytics to
detect suspicious orders. Walmart has emphasized that it relies on “big data” in its
pharmacy operations to “enhance, customize and optimize the shopping
experience” and “to make Walmart pharmacies more efficient,” namely by using
the data to “help[] the pharmacy with staff scheduling and to reduce the amount of
time it takes a prescription to be filled.”72
Walmart also had access to additional data and information it could use
to determine whether an order was suspicious, including, for example, knowledge
of pill-mill prescribers, historical order quantities and patterns, previously flagged
70 Id. ¶483.
71 Id. ¶¶484-87.
72 Id. ¶488
orders, previous suspicious order reports and prior and current suspicious order
monitoring (SOM) remediation plans (discussed below) for its pharmacies.73
Despite possessing a wealth of data and other information to detect
suspicious orders Walmart did not create or employ an effective SOM program. As
a result, Walmart failed to detect and report hundreds of thousands of suspicious
orders that its pharmacies placed with distribution centers, in violation of the CSA.
Walmart’s specific violations in this regard are discussed more fully below.
A. Internal Documents Informed Defendants that its SOM Was
Inadequate; That Walmart Was in Violation of the 2011 MOA and
that Walmart Was at Risk of DEA Enforcement
On or about December 27, 2007, the DEA sent letters to all registered
distributors of controlled substances, including Walmart, reminding them of their
legal obligation under 21 C.F.R. § 1301.74(b) to detect and report suspicious orders
to DEA.74
In the December 27, 2007 letter, DEA advised distributors that failing
to comply with their obligations could lead to great harm: “[A]ll registrants—
manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and practitioners—share responsibility for
maintaining appropriate safeguards against diversion. Nonetheless, given the extent
73 Id. ¶487.
74 DOJ Complaint ¶¶506-507.
of prescription drug abuse in the United States, along with the dangerous and
potentially lethal consequences of such abuse, even just one distributor that uses its
DEA registration to facilitate diversion can cause enormous harm.75”
Despite this, prior to 2010 Walmart had no written policies or
procedures related to the identification or reporting of suspicious orders. Walmart
therefore shipped suspicious orders regularly.76
In November 2010 Walmart implemented a formal policy titled
“Pharmacy Manual 21-402 (“Controlled Substance Monitoring”). (“PM 21-402”)
which had numerous flaws and was wholly ineffective for several reasons.77
In or around October 2013, the Company’s U.S. Compliance
department generated a document titled “Controlled Substance Risk Assessment:
Executive Summary” (“October 2013 CSRA”)78 that stated Walmart had not
“[d]esigne[d] & operate[d] a system [sic] to detect suspicious orders and report them
to the DEA when discovered.” The October 2013 CSRA did not contain an expected
date for such a system, listing only “TBD” in the delivery date field. The October
2013 CSRA recognized that it was necessary to create and operate such a system to
“meet obligations of DEA MOA.”

78 Opioid MDL, 1:17-MD-02807 (Aug. 13, 2019) (Dkt. No. 2218-7) (Exhibit I
hereto).
In January 2014 Walmart hired an outside consultant to evaluate a
revised statistical methodology to identify suspicious orders. The expert consultant,
a company called Mu Sigma, provided a report to Walmart in which it identified
serious flaws in Walmart’s proposed statistical methodology. These shortcomings
included an inability to detect patterns over time and one-size-fits-all minimum
thresholds.79
Mu Sigma proposed an alternative methodology that would capture
suspicious orders missed by Walmart’s flawed approach. Walmart rejected Mu
Sigma’s proposal, at least in part because it cost $185,000.80 To put this in
perspective, in a little over a four-year period Walmart shipped approximately 15.2
million orders of Schedule II controlled substances and Schedule III narcotics to its
own pharmacies, having a retail value of well over $750 million.81
By mid-2014 Walmart recognized that it was at risk of a DEA
enforcement action because it was not complying with the 2011 MOA and the
CSA’s requirements for detecting and reporting suspicious orders. A June 14, 2014
email from Walmart’s then Director of Compliance states that Walmart considered
79 DOJ Complaint ¶¶636-37.
80 Id. ¶¶638-39.
81 Id. 682.
modifying its SOM system to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of
non-compliance with 21 CFR 1301.74(b).82”
According to a June 2014 Walmart “Portfolio Scoring Worksheet,
Suspicious Order Monitoring” (“June 2014 PSW”)83 that Walmart’s Health &
Wellness department generated, Walmart’s board of directors- which included
Defendant McMillon- was informed that Walmart was not complying with the 2011
MOA (and the CSA) and was likely to face severe potential financial and
reputational consequences as a result.
The June 2014 PSW is titled “Portfolio Scoring Worksheet” with the
“Project Name” “Suspicious Order Monitoring” and “Program Name” “Health and
Wellness Logistics”. Walmart created the document in response to the 2011 MOA.
It is a scoring sheet assessing the effectiveness of Walmart’s suspicious order
monitoring program. The document contains a “Corporate Governance Scoring
Section.” With respect to suspicious order monitoring, it says: “Is the risk being
mitigated today by manual, systematic or a combination of both…” The response is
“5”, which means “No, Emerging Risk, has no processes in place today”. In the
next box it says: “What is the likelihood that the events or conditions underlying the
Risk will occur?” Response is: “Likely.” In the next box down: “What is the
82 DOJ Complaint ¶513.
83 Opioid MDL, 1:17-MD-02804 (Aug. 13, 2019 (Dkt. No. 2218-3) (Exhibit J
hereto).
potential financial or reputational impact to the company if [these]
events…occur?” “Severe.” The next page: “What is the extent of the Legal or
Regulatory requirement?” Response: “National.” “Is [this] effort related to a
settlement [or] agreement with a Government Agency…” Response: “Yes.” “Is
this effort Executive directed.” Response: “Yes.” “Is this effort Board directed or
informed?” Response: “Board informed.” The PSW makes clear that the suspicious
order monitoring program was the product of an executive directive that the Board
was being informed about the program.
Accordingly, June 2014 PSW discloses that suspicious order
monitoring was an “existing risk” for which the Company had “no processes in
place today.” The Board and management also knew that it was “likely” that the
“events or conditions underlying the Risk would occur,” leading to a “severe” risk
of “financial and reputational impact to the Company[,]” which included
“physical security risks,” “health and safety risks,” and “fraudulent activities.”
In 2015, a proposal from Walmart’s U.S. Compliance Department
(“2015 Proposal”)84 to “design and operate a system to identify ‘Suspicious Orders’
of controlled substances” acknowledged that the Company’s suspicious order
monitoring program still required immediate and substantial enhancements in order
84 Opioid MDL, 1:17-MD-02804 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 13, 2019) (Dkt. No. 2218-4)
(Exhibit K hereto).
“to help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of non-compliance with [the
CSA].” The 2015 Proposal indicates that Walmart’s U.S. Compliance Department
requested that a project be performed to modify Walmart’s suspicious order
monitoring system to “allow program enhancements to help Walmart to avoid DEA
enforcement as a result of non-compliance with 21 CFR 1301.74(b). The 2015
Proposal noted that the “benefits” to be achieved from “completing this initiative”
are “Compliance with federal law and VAWD accreditation standards.”
DEA diversion investigators even directly told Walmart that it was
violating the law in failing to report suspicious orders. For example, in a February
2015 meeting, DEA diversion investigators informed Walmart that its practice of
reducing the quantity of suspiciously large orders for controlled substances without
informing the DEA that the order was suspicious (as discussed further below)
violated the CSA.85 Despite this, Walmart continued to engage in this illegal
practice through at least November 29, 2017.86
In addition, by March 2014 Walmart knew that the DEA was holding
other companies that dispensed and/or distributed controlled substances- two of
which were ultimately Walmart’s “Pharmacy” co-defendants in the Opioid MDL-
accountable for their CSA violations in connection with the opioid crisis. A March
85 DOJ Complaint ¶567.
86 Id. ¶568.
29, 2014 “Health & Wellness Compliance” presentation by Jim Langman,
Walmart’s Vice President, Health & Wellness Compliance, US (“2014 Compliance
Presentation”) contains a slide titled “DEA Headlines.”87 The slide contains six
bullet points (two of which are fully redacted) listing DEA actions against
pharmacies and distributors of controlled substances:
-“September 2012- DEA revokes Controlled Substance permit for 2 CVS
pharmacies;
-“DEA suspends Cardinal’s controlled substances license at it’s [sic]
Lakeland, Florida distribution center, which serves 2,500 pharmacies in
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.”;
-“Walgreens Jupiter Distribution Center and six Florida Walgreens retail
pharmacies had their controlled substances licenses suspended [Redacted];
-“[Redacted] the settlement revokes the Registrants’ ability to distribute or
dispense controlled substances listed in Schedules II-V [Redacted]. As part
of the settlement, Walgreens admitted that it failed to uphold its obligations
as a DEA registrant.”
On March 11, 2015 the 2011 MOA’s four-year term expired without
Walmart ever having achieved legal compliance, in violation of both the MOA and
the basic legal requirements of the CSA.
After the 2011 MOA expired, Walmart’s SOM barely changed and
remained entirely ineffective. Walmart’s modifications, which it implemented in
87 Opioid MDL,17-MD-02802, Plaintiffs Trial Exhibit P-14585, p. 31, (Dkt. No.
4128-29) (Nov. 8, 2021), (Exhibit M hereto).
August 2015 consisted of “a few modifications to its existing Reddwerks system”
and “implement[ed] pharmacy-specific and drug-specific thresholds to replace the
20-bottle and 50-bottle thresholds that Walmart had been using in Reddwerks.”88
Walmart’s August 2015 modifications- which Walmart knew were
flawed based on the Mu Sigma report- failed to fix previously identified defects, or
implement basic functions necessary for a CSA compliant system, such as: (i)
“detect[ing] whether orders were of an unusual frequency or unusual pattern, much
less report those kinds of unusual orders;” (ii) responding to “known incidents of
diversion occurring at its pharmacies;” (iii) “consider[ing] whether a pharmacy was
ordering the same controlled substance of the same drug strength, but with multiple
[National Drug Codes];” and (iv) not “ignore[ing] at least hundreds of thousands of
orders that its pharmacies placed with independent distributors.”89
Testimony in the Opioid MDL corroborates that Walmart made no real
attempts to comply with the 2011 MOA for “business” reasons. For example, Brad
Nelson, the controlled substance compliance director responsible for Walmart’s
refusal to fill (RTF) project associated with the 2011 MOA emailed a regional
manager at Walmart just a month before the 2011 MOA expired, writing:
The MOA that requires the reporting of Refusal to fills expires
in 30 days. We have not invested a great amount of effort in doing
88 DOJ Complaint ¶¶634-42.
89 Id. ¶¶634-50.
analysis on the data since the agreement is virtually over. Driving
sales and patient awareness is a far better use of our Market Directors
and Market manager’s time.90
Walmart’s 30(b)(6) representative in the Opioid MDL, Susanne
Hiland, similarly testified that Walmart chose not to adopt a more rigorous limit
system in connection with the 2011 MOA and the CSA because it “didn’t make
sense for the business.”
In denying Walmart’s motion for summary judgment in the Opioid
MDL, Judge Polster found that Walmart’s suspicious order monitoring program
“suggests obvious deficiencies that a layperson could plainly recognize.”
The October 2013 CSRA, the June 2014 PSW, and the 2015 Proposal
all make clear that Defendants were aware that Walmart failed to meet its legal
obligations under the CSA and the 2011 MOA, subjecting the Company to increased
risks of a DOJ enforcement action and corresponding criminal and/or civil penalties
and reputational damage.
In April 2018, almost immediately after learning of the DOJ’s planned
indictment, Walmart exited the distribution business altogether. Walmart’s decision
to exit the distribution business shows that its CSA compliance controls were so
deficient that rather than attempt belatedly to adopt and maintain a legally compliant
suspicious order monitoring system Walmart would rather cease its business
90 ProPublica Article.
distributing opioids. Walmart’s decision to end its business distributing opioids
after the DOJ threatened to indict Walmart demonstrates that Walmart was aware
of its legal violations.
Walmart’s CSA violations as a distributor which resulted from its
knowing failure to have an effective suspicious order monitoring system are
summarized below.
B. Walmart’s Specific CSA Violations in its Role as a Distributor
1) Walmart Failed to detect and report orders of unusual
frequency or pattern
The CSA required Walmart to evaluate orders showing unusual size,
frequency, or patterns. Walmart’s SOM system focused exclusively on the size of
the orders.
Because Walmart’s SOM system did not flag orders for unusual
frequency and pattern Walmart did not report any of these orders to the DEA, in
violation of the law.91
2) Walmart Failed to detect and report unusually large orders
At some point prior to July 2014, Walmart’s SOM program began
using weekly size “thresholds” and “hard limits” limiting the quantity of controlled
substances its pharmacies could order from its distribution centers. An order that hit
91 DOJ Complaint ¶¶ 519-26.
a “threshold” was supposed to trigger a temporary hold to the order for further
evaluation (i.e. to determine if that order was suspicious for purposes of the CSA).
A “hard limit” was supposed to serve as the maximum amount of a particular drug
the pharmacy could order per week.92
Walmart’s thresholds and hard limits ignored differences between its
pharmacies. Because of differences in customer characteristics and populations
among pharmacies a one-size-fits-all approach to thresholds and hard limits made
no sense. For example, Walmart knew that its pharmacies varied in many ways.
Some pharmacies served sparsely populated rural communities and other
pharmacies served large urban communities with big populations. Accordingly, it
did not make sense for two pharmacies- one serving a large population and one a
small population- to be subject to the same limitations with respect to the size of
controlled substance orders. Despite this, Walmart utilized this arbitrary approach.
As a result, Walmart failed to detect and report many unusually large orders.93
The only controlled substance dose and strength Walmart imposed a
“hard limit” on was Oxycodone 30mg, wherein Walmart placed a hard limit of 20
bottles per store per week. Despite this, Walmart violated this hard limit at least
216 times between June 2013 and July 2015.94
92 Id. ¶¶529-31
93 Id. ¶¶529-537.
94 Id. ¶¶538-45.
Additionally, Walmart’s size thresholds were based on the number of
bottles of a particular controlled substance as opposed to the number of dosage units
in the actual bottles. This approach was flawed and ineffective and simply allowed
pharmacies to evade the bottle-based threshold by ordering fewer bottles which
contained more pills per bottle.
Walmart was aware, based on memos from pharmacy managers, that
setting thresholds based on bottle quantity rather than dosage units was a loophole
where pharmacies could, and did, order excessive amounts of controlled substances.
For example, the General Manager of one of Walmart’s six distribution centers
wrote in a memo that “several control….items have changed from a 100 count bottle
to a 1000 count bottle,” such that a pharmacy that had previously ordered 20 bottles
of a controlled substance for a total of 2,000 dosage units was now able to order 20
bottles of that same controlled substance for a total of 20,000 dosage units. The
General Manager concluded “[t]he system now should flag pills verses [sic]
bottles.” Walmart recognized this problem in October 2013 and did not change its
policy in this regard until at least August 2015.95
Another flaw in Walmart’s size thresholds was that Walmart’s SOM
program failed to aggregate and flag multiple orders a pharmacy placed for the same
drug and strength where those orders were for products that had different National
95 Id. ¶¶546-53.
Drug Codes (“NDC”) because they were made by different manufacturers. In other
words, if multiple manufacturers made the same drug, the drug would have multiple
NDCs. Because of this flaw, Walmart’s SOM system failed to flag orders that
exceeded size thresholds.96
Walmart also avoided reporting suspicious orders by “cutting” the size
of orders that exceeded the threshold. For example, if it received an order for 50
bottles and the threshold was 20, it would reduce the order and ship 20 bottles.
Walmart did so without reporting these suspicious orders to the DEA, in violation
of CSA mandates.
Walmart branded pharmacies, in addition to receiving its controlled
substance orders from Walmart’s distribution hubs, also received hundreds of
thousands of orders from two other distributors: McKesson and
AmerisourceBergen. However, Walmart did not factor in shipments from these two
distributors when considering whether its pharmacies had exceeded thresholds and
size limits. Walmart was aware of this flaw. An October 2014 Walmart internal
presentation assessing the efficacy of its SOM system noted “McKesson orders are
not considered in evaluation.”97
96 Id. ¶¶554-58.
97 Id. ¶¶569-578.
To cover up its legal violations Walmart began classifying unusually
large orders as “errors,” when there was absolutely no indication that the pharmacy
had intended to order a smaller quantity. In so doing Walmart failed to report
suspiciously large orders to the DEA, in violation of the CSA.98
3) Walmart Ignored Specific Signs of Diversion from its Own
Walmart Branded Pharmacies
In addition to ignoring orders that were suspicious by virtue of their
unusual size, frequency and pattern, Walmart also ignored other warning signs that
orders Walmart pharmacies placed were suspicious.
The DOJ Complaint sets forth in detail numerous examples where
Walmart pharmacists contacted Walmart’s compliance department about
prescriptions written by “pill mill” prescribers, and illegal diversion occurring
inside Walmart stores and Walmart failed to take any remedial action or notify the
DEA of suspicious orders from those stores in violation of the CSA’s clear legal
requirements.
For example, in June 2016, Walmart’s Director of Controlled
Substances notified Walmart’s Regional Health and Wellness Director for Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia that a certain doctor was one of the top three
prescribers for oxycodone 30mg for a store in Tampa; that 75% of this doctor’s
98 Id. ¶¶579-83.
prescriptions for oxycodone 30 mg were for quantities of 120 doses or greater; and
that the top three drugs this doctor prescribed were oxycodone 30mg,
hydromorphone 8 mg and methadone 10 mg. Despite this knowledge, Walmart took
no action to limit shipments of controlled substances to Walmart pharmacies that
routinely filled prescriptions for this and other “pill mill” prescribers.99
4) Walmart Failed to Adequately Staff and Train its Compliance
Personnel and Shipped Flagged Orders Before Compliance
Personnel Could Examine Them
Despite being the largest employer in the United States, and despite
having 5,000 pharmacies, Walmart failed to devote sufficient personnel to operate
its SOM program. Walmart recognized this. For example, an “Overview of SOM
project Progress” attached to a November 23, 2014 email noted problems including
“Inconsistent application of monitoring standards by associate across DC
[distribution center] facilities”; “No consistent training for associates”; “No
dedicated [Home Office] resource”; and “SOM policy only included DC associate
responsibilities – no [Home Office] involvement or cross-functional
collaboration.”100
99 Id. ¶¶584-595.
100 Id. ¶¶596-99.
Walmart also did not allow its staff adequate time to examine flagged
orders, chose not to review every flagged order, and failed to provide employees
with training specific to monitoring suspicious orders of controlled substances.101
5) Walmart Failed to Investigate and Report to the DEA Flagged
Orders and Failed to Document its Evaluation of Flagged
Orders
As a Walmart Senior Manager for Logistics stated in an August 27,
2014 email “our obligation is to monitor all orders, investigate ‘orders of interest’
(potentially suspicious orders), hold any ‘order of hold any ‘order of interest’
until/unless the order is investigated and cleared and report any ‘suspicious’ orders
to DEA.”102
Despite this, Walmart routinely failed to investigate thousands of
flagged orders.
Walmart also had no process to document facts about orders that
exceeded threshold limits. In the instances when Walmart did conduct due diligence
on flagged orders it often did not even keep a record of this due diligence.103
101 Id. ¶¶608-09.
102 Id. ¶612.
103 Id. ¶¶626-33.
6) Walmart’s Failure to Detect and Report Suspicious Orders
Occurred on A Grand Scale
As a result of Walmart’s failure to implement an effective system for
detecting and monitoring suspicious orders Walmart failed to report at least
hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders to the DEA in violation of the CSA.104
The DOJ Complaint states: “Walmart’s ultralow rate of suspicious-
order reporting is incredible. The small number of suspicious orders Walmart
reported cannot be credibly attributed to a lack of unusual or otherwise suspicious
orders placed by its pharmacies. By comparison, McKesson, the independent
distributor that served as the back-up distributor to Walmart-branded pharmacies,
received far fewer orders from Walmart’s pharmacies but reported to DEA more
than 13,000 suspicious orders from Walmart pharmacies between June 26, 2013,
and November 29, 2017. Walmart would have been notified of these 13,000
suspicious orders in all instances where McKesson rejected them because they were
suspicious.
The DOJ Complaint further states:
Walmart’s failure to report suspicious orders stems from Walmart’s
decisions to operate a system that failed to detect suspicious orders
and to manipulate that system to avoid reporting to DEA those
suspicious orders that were detected….When Walmart fulfilled
suspicious orders, Walmart’s approach allowed dangerous controlled
substances to enter the market. Even in those circumstances where
104 DOJ Complaint ¶¶643-680.
Walmart recognized that certain orders were “suspicious” after those
orders had already been shipped to its stores, Walmart’s failure to report
those orders and take other remedial steps allowed the ordered drugs to
“enter the market.” Walmart’s systematic failure, for years, to comply
with its legal obligation to detect and report each of its suspicious
orders thus created a major obstacle to efforts to combat the
prescription drug abuse epidemic.105
The DOJ Complaint also explains that Walmart financially benefited
from these violations of law:
Walmart chose to avoid the expense of creating and implementing a
proper program for monitoring and reporting suspicious orders. For
example, Walmart avoided the expense of creating and implementing a
remediation plan for each suspicious order, which could have imposed
burdens on Walmart and might also have uncovered improper activity
that Walmart would have to remediate. Likewise, Walmart avoided the
expense of paying for adequate numbers of compliance personnel. Most
critically, Walmart profited by providing its pharmacies with
unusually large quantities of controlled substances to sell, and from
selling other products to customers who came to Walmart stores only
because Walmart pharmacies would readily provide these controlled
substances. In sum, Walmart chose, for years, to disregard a well-
established legal obligation on a systematic basis and a huge scale
involving at least hundreds of thousands of orders of controlled
substances. In doing so, Walmart substantially benefited itself while
increasing the risk of undetected unlawful conduct and serious
widespread harm to Americans in the midst of a nationwide
prescription drug abuse epidemic.106
Undisclosed Government Activity Related to Walmart’s Opioid Business
Unbeknownst to investors, the government has targeted Walmart’s
105 Id. ¶695.
106 Id. ¶696.
unlawful opioid dispensing and distribution practices for over a decade.
In 2009, the DEA took nationwide action against Walmart. In
November 2009, the DEA issued an Order to Show Cause seeking to revoke the
registration of a Walmart pharmacy in California to dispense controlled substances.
The 2009 OTSC alleged that the Walmart pharmacy:
(1) Improperly dispensed controlled substances to individuals based on
purported prescriptions physicians who were not licensed to practice
medicine in California had issued;
(2) Dispensed controlled substances based on Internet prescriptions
physicians issued that were not for a legitimate medical purpose and/or
outside the usual course of professional practice; and
(3) Dispensed controlled substances to individuals the pharmacy knew or
should have known were diverting controlled substances.107
To resolve the threatened enforcement proceeding stemming from the
2009 OTSC, in March 2011 the DEA and Walmart entered into a nationwide 2011
MOA. The 2011 MOA required Walmart to adopt a national compliance program
designed to ensure that it fulfilled its legal obligations under the CSA when filling
controlled substance prescriptions. Walmart also agreed to collect reports from its
pharmacies when those pharmacists determined that controlled substance
prescriptions were invalid and refused to fill them.108 While Walmart’s compliance
107 2011 MOA (Exh. A) at 1.
108 Id. at 2, ¶4b.
unit collected these refusal-to-fill reports, it chose, for years not to alert Walmart’s
pharmacists so that they could use that information to determine whether to fill
similar prescriptions.109 The failure to share these important reports among
pharmacists rendered the reports themselves useless.
The 2011 MOA had a four-year term. Accordingly, the MOA was in
effect from March 11, 2011 to March 11, 2015.110
Pursuant to the MOA, Walmart promised to “maintain a compliance
program, updated as necessary, designed to detect and prevent diversion of
controlled substances as required by the Controlled Substances Act and applicable
DEA regulations.”111
Walmart authorized its Senior VP and President, Health and Wellness,
John Agwanobi, along with its outside counsel at King & Spaulding LLP, Catherine
M. O’Neill to sign the 2011 MOA on Walmart’s behalf. Even though the 2009
OTSC involved one specific Walmart pharmacy, the 2011 MOA bound the entire
Company, i.e., each of Walmart’s then 4,700 pharmacies.112
The 2011 MOA was between the DEA and “Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. on
its behalf as well as on behalf of its subsidiaries that operated pharmacies registered

with [the] DEA.” The 2011 MOA states that Walmart and the DEA entered it “to
avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation.”113
In the 2011 MOA Walmart recognized that to comply with its legal
obligation not to dispense controlled substances based on prescriptions “issued by
physicians for other than a legitimate medical purpose and/or outside the usual
course of professional practice…,” Walmart needed to create a process that would
ensure that its pharmacists were identifying common signs of diversion.
The 2011 MOA specifically mandated Walmart to include in its
compliance program procedures to ensure that pharmacists identified red flags:
The program shall include procedures designed to identify the common
signs associated with the diversion of controlled substances including,
but not limited to, doctor-shopping requests for early refills, altered or
forged prescriptions, prescriptions written by doctors not licensed to
practice medicine in the jurisdiction where the patient is located, and
prescriptions written for other than a legitimate medical purpose by an
individual acting outside the usual course of his professional practice.114
In the MOA, Walmart also agreed that if one of its pharmacists
concluded that a prescription was not issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a
practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice, was forged, or had
been altered, and it refused to fill that prescription, Walmart would notify the local
DEA field office within seven business days of the refusal to fill.115
113 Id. p. 1, 2 ¶1.
114 Id. p. 2, ¶4a.
115 Id. p. 2-3, ¶4b.
Walmart was also required to institute policies and procedures to block
the early refill of controlled substances, maintain and enforce a policy allowing
pharmacists to obtain and review patient or doctor profiles from the prescription
monitoring program before dispensing controlled substances, implement
procedures to routinely verify the validity of DEA registration numbers on
prescriptions, implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that
pharmacies comply with other applicable laws, and notify the DEA whenever
Walmart refuses to fill suspicious prescriptions for controlled substances.116
Additionally, the 2011 MOA provided that “Walmart acknowledges
and agrees that the obligations taken in this subparagraph do not fulfill the totality
of its obligations under the CSA and its implementing regulations.”117
As detailed in the DOJ Complaint and herein, Walmart flagrantly
violated all of the 2011 MOA’s provisions.
Defendants were aware that Walmart violated the 2011 MOA and that
the consequences to Walmart of having violated it would be severe. Defendants’
awareness is evidenced, inter alia, by the October 2013 CSRA, the 2014 PSW and
the 2015 Proposal. (See Infra ¶¶145-46; 150-53).
116 Id. p. 3, ¶¶4c.-4k.
117 Id. p.2, ¶4a.
First, the 2013 CSRA explicitly states that Walmart had not designed
a SOM. Second, the 2014 PSW states that Walmart’s SOM program was the product
of an executive directive and that the board was being informed of it. It states that
Walmart’s SOM program was related to a settlement agreement with the
government (i.e. the 2011 MOA). Nevertheless, the 2014 PSW recognizes that
Walmart had “no processes in place” to comply with its legal requirements to have
a functioning SOM pursuant to the 2011 MOA and the CSA. It further
acknowledges that the risks related to not having a SOM program are severe
financial and reputational impact to the Company, which include physical security
risks, health and safety risks and fraudulent activities. Further, it states that these
severe risks are likely to occur. Third, Walmart’s 2015 Compliance Department
Proposal admits that Walmart’s SOM program required immediate and substantial
enhancements to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of non-
compliance with [the CSA].” (Infra ¶¶145-52).
In the summer of 2016, federal prosecutors began investigating two
Texas doctors (Howard Diamond and Randall Wade) who were prescribing vast
amounts of opioids. DEA agents surveilled Wade’s clinic is August 2016 and
followed three women to a Walmart pharmacy in McKinney, Texas. The three
women walked out with large quantities of painkillers.118
On December 7, 2016, the DEA raided Walmart Store 206 in
McKinney, Texas obtaining records about Diamond and Wade (who were both
eventually convicted of illegal distribution of opioids and sentenced to 20 and 10
years, respectively). Raids of Fortune 500 companies are extremely rare.119
Walmart has acknowledged that on December 7, 2016 it learned that
the EDTX DOJ was criminally investigating the Company following the DEA’s
raid.120
In addition to the EDTX DOJ Investigation, Walmart received more
than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA for its prescribing practices from
2000 to 2018.121 The DEA issues a Letter of Admonition if it finds deficiencies in
an unannounced inspection auditing controlled substance storage locations and
laboratories. In a typical audit, DEA Diversion Investigators inspect the controlled
substance licensee/registrant for compliance with the CSA. A Letter of Admonition

requires a written response describing the actions to correct deficiencies. Walmart
also entered two Controlled Substances Act settlements in 2007 and 2008, one for
filling unlawful prescriptions and the other for recordkeeping violations.122
Just three months before learning of the EDTX DOJ’s criminal
investigation, in October 2016, Defendant McMillon bumped into a friend named
Jerry Jones, whose adult son had ended his life after becoming addicted to
prescription opioids. Jones was speaking at a conference on prescription drug abuse
prevention. Defendant McMillon asked Jones what Walmart could do to help his
“mission” of combatting prescription drug abuse and fighting the opioid epidemic.
Defendant McMillon made clear to Jones that he was serious and not just asking to
be polite.123
Plaintiffs in the Opioid MDL have produced emails evidencing that
Defendant McMillon received emails from Jones with suggestions, and that
McMillon then forwarded those emails to other “Walmart executives.” According
to Jones, in the months immediately following these emails, Walmart told Jones it
would start “throwing technology” at the opioid crisis to “monitor prescriptions”
stating, “if we detect over-prescribing, we are going to cut them off.”124

From December 7, 2016 onward the Criminal Investigation
progressively intensified.
Federal prosecutors discovered that Walmart flagrantly violated the
2011 MOA. According to ProPublica “as far as federal prosecutors and the DEA
were concerned- the MOA had placed Walmart on parole—and the company had
violated its terms.”
In March 2017 EDTX Assistant U.S. Attorney Heather Rattan issued
an email search warrant to the Company. The search warrant related to documents
involving certain pharmacists in Texas.125
In June 2017 AUSA Rattan expanded the search warrant, seeking
information related to Walmart’s dispensing controlled substances generally.126
Between June 2017 and July 2018 EDTX issued five DEA
Administrative Subpoenas in connection with its criminal investigation of
Walmart.127
In November 2017 Walmart also began responding to what it described
as “broad document demands” from EDTX Civil AUSA Joshua Russ. AUSA Russ

informed Walmart that he was conducting a parallel civil investigation of potential
CSA violations related to Walmart’s dispensing of controlled substances.128
In connection with the Investigations, Walmart produced nearly one
million pages of documents and six million prescription records,129 evidencing the
breadth and scope of the Investigations in addition to the liability involved (since
each illegal prescription carries a penalty). Civil penalties for violating the CSA are
up to $67,627 for each unlawful prescription filled and $15,691 for each suspicious
order not reported.130
Then, on March 28, 2018, AUSA Rattan informed Walmart of her
intention to indict the Company.131
Walmart immediately requested a meeting with federal prosecutors in
the EDTX. Walmart told the prosecutors that they hoped to resolve any criminal
and civil proceedings in one shot and insisted that EDTX AUSA in charge of the
civil division Joshua Russ attend the meeting. Prosecutors demanded that Walmart
make this request in writing. Walmart complied.132

132 ProPublica Article.
In April 2018 Walmart met with EDTX federal prosecutors. Walmart’s
inside counsel, Bob Balfe, Chief Counsel for Global Investigations, and Walmart’s
lead outside counsel, Karen Hewitt of Jones Day attending the meetings. Walmart
and federal prosecutors reportedly agreed on the facts but differed over whether
they justified a criminal charge.133
The details of the meetings and conversations between Walmart and
federal prosecutors that took place in the spring and summer of 2018 are set forth
in correspondence between Walmart’s outside counsel at Jones Day, Karen Hewitt
and Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski and Gustav Eyler, co-head of
the national Walmart Working Group within the DOJ and director of the Consumer
Protection Branch of the DOJ.
On May 3 and 4, 2018 Walmart and its top attorneys again met with
federal prosecutors at the United States Attorneys’ Office in Plano, Texas. EDTX
U.S. Attorney Joe Brown, as well as the criminal and civil AUSA’s working on the
case, attended the meetings.134 During the first six hours of the meeting Walmart’s
lawyers described the results of their internal investigation. While they claimed that
they had not found evidence of criminal wrongdoing they admitted that “Walmart
could have and should have done more to voluntarily combat the opioid crisis.”135
133 ProPublica Article.
134 August 2018 Hewitt Letter, p. 4.
135 ProPublica Article.
At the May 3-4 meetings federal prosecutors for the EDTX told
Walmart that it would imminently indict the Company. Prosecutors told Walmart
the Company should pay $1 billion to resolve the matter civilly.136
On June 6, 2018, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Iris Lan at the
DOJ in Washington, D.C. told Walmart that the DOJ’s Narcotics and Dangerous
Drug Section was assigned as a partner to both the criminal and civil aspects of the
case.137
As far as the civil case, some of the prosecuting attorneys were willing
to trade off a large fine in exchange for Walmart agreeing to a more detailed public
statement of facts. EDTX Civil Chief Randi Russell stated that Walmart would have
to admit it had “killed people.” Walmart was eager to avoid this admission because
it would bring negative publicity and make the company vulnerable to private and
state lawsuits.138
On July 2, 2018, EDTX U.S. Attorney Joe Brown, AUSA Rattan and
AUSA Maureen Smith traveled to Walmart’s corporate headquarters in Bentonville
Arkansas. They met with Walmart’s inside and outside counsel and counsel for
136 August 2018 Hewitt Letter, p. 4.

138 ProPublica Article.
Walmart’s Audit Committee. At the meeting they provided a “reverse proffer” of
the criminal case against Walmart.139
During the July 2, 2018, meeting EDTX federal prosecutors told the
Company that it intended to indict Walmart on July 11, 2018, nine days later.
Walmart’s counsel at Jones Day stated that at the meeting “U.S Attorney Brown
noted that the planned indictment should not come as a surprise to Walmart as
EDTX had stated its plans during the May 2018 meetings.”140
During the July 2, 2018, meeting Walmart was able to convince the
prosecutors to postpone the July 11 indictment date to August 8 so that Walmart
would have time to make a presentation to prosecutors.141
On July 26, 2018, Walmart made its presentation to federal prosecutors
at the U.S. Attorneys’ Office in Plano, Texas.142
According to the MDL Court, the evidence shows that Defendant
McMillon has personal knowledge about the PowerPoint presentations to the DOJ
that Walmart’s counsel made at the July 26, 2018 meeting. The evidence indicates
139 August 2018 Hewitt Letter, p. 4-5.
140 Id. p. 4.
141 Id. p. 4-5.
142 Id. p. 5.
that Walmart’s lawyers specifically consulted McMillon during the formulation and
approval of Walmart’s response to the DOJ’s criminal investigation.143
In attempting to convince the U.S. Attorneys not to criminally indict
Walmart, Walmart’s outside counsel at Jones Day highlighted the damage an
indictment would cause to Walmart and its shareholders, describing the “profound
negative impact on the lives and families of the Company’s 1.5 million U.S.
employees and its innocent shareholders. The decision to indict Walmart could
ultimately result in layoffs. It would also likely mean the loss of billions of dollars
in the value of Walmart shares held in retirement saving accounts for millions of
Americans and the pension funds of countless nonprofits and public
employees.”144
In response, AUSA Rattan said that Walmart was no different from an
individual criminal defendant who pleaded for leniency with the government by
stating that her children would be harmed by her incarceration. Civil Chief Randi
Russell stated that Walmart’s size did not make it above prosecution.145
On August 7, 2018, Walmart’s outside counsel and U.S. Attorney
Brown, Criminal Chief Matt Quinn and AUSA Rattan had a conversation.
143 Exhibit F, p. 3-4 (Opioid MDL Ruling Regarding Deposition of Walmart CEO
McMillon).

145 ProPublica Article.
Notwithstanding Walmart’s pleas, EDTX federal prosecutors would proceed with
the indictment. As Walmart’s counsel stated: “U.S. Attorney Brown stated he
intends to indict Walmart. AUSA Rattan then said that her intention was to
present an indictment to the grand jury on September 12.”146
On August 10, 2018, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lan directed Walmart’s
counsel to present Walmart’s submission to the Criminal Division.147
According to ProPublica, in the weeks that followed Walmart sought
to quash the criminal indictment by undermining the independence of public
prosecutors and appealing directly to the President’s administration and top DOJ
officials in Washington.
Further, EDTX federal prosecutors believed that Walmart had
exploited its access to high-level DOJ officials in Washington, D.C. during the
investigation to influence the outcome of the investigation. For example, Company
lawyers met with Attorney General William Barr during the Investigation. The
Company also hired Rachel Brand, who had left the DOJ in February 2018 to take
a high-level job in Walmart’s legal department.148
146 August 2018 Hewitt Letter p. 5.
147 Id.
148 ProPublica article.
On August 31, 2018, the DOJ informed Walmart it was then declining
to criminally prosecute the Company.149
Notwithstanding the declination, in September 2018 AUSA Rattan told
Walmart that the investigation into the Company remained ongoing and that
Walmart should continue to comply with the DEA’s administrative subpoenas.150
Texas federal prosecutors felt strongly that the evidence supported a
criminal prosecution. In October 2018 EDTX federal prosecutors and DEA agents
who had been working on the Criminal Investigation went to Washington to appeal
to the DEA’s acting administrator Uttam Dhillon to revive the criminal case.151
EDTX U.S. Attorney Joe Brown and AUSA Rattan laid out the
evidence against Walmart. They told Dhillon that Walmart pharmacists from all
over the country told the Company that they did not want to fill prescriptions of
opioids because they were from doctors running pill mills. Customers in Texas had
died after taking suspect prescriptions that Walmart filled. Pharmacists pleaded with
Walmart’s corporate office. Walmart refused to take corporate-wide action. A
Walmart opioid compliance manager told a Walmart executive in an email that
149 September 2019 Hewitt Letter p. 4.
150 Id.
151 ProPublica Article.
Walmart’s focus should be on “driving sales.” Dhillon reportedly exclaimed “Jesus
Christ” “Why aren’t we talking about this as a criminal case.”152
Dhillon then accompanied the group of prosecutors and DEA officials
to the DOJ in D.C. to meet with the then-deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.
Rattan explained to Rosenstein that Walmart was a repeat offender and had violated
the 2011 MOA, justifying the extraordinary path of criminal prosecution.153
Rosenstein declined to permit a criminal prosecution of the Company
but directed the prosecutors to focus on bringing criminal charges against individual
Walmart employees. Brian Benczkowski, the head of the DOJ’s Civil Division told
Joe Brown: “you have a whopper of a civil case.”154
On November 20, 2018, AUSA Russ (who was now the EDTX Civil
Chief) and Gus Eyler contacted Walmart’s counsel and stated that DOJ had formed
a “Working Group” to investigate Walmart for civil violations of the CSA. The
Working Group consisted of 15 separate U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and three litigating
components of the DOJ.155
On February 13, 2019 the Working Group issued an Omnibus
Subpoena to Walmart seeking evidence across 36 broad categories related to
152 Id.
153 Id.
154 Id.
155 September 2019 Hewitt Letter, p. 5.
dispensing and distribution of controlled substances, including records of all
prescriptions filled and all pharmacies in the Working Group’s 15 districts over a
five year period; prescription records for all prescribers who have been corporately
blocked by Walmart, along with 329 additional prescribers over a five-year period;
and all witness statements, transcripts, pleadings, and discovery materials that the
Company produced in the MDL.156 The breadth of the Omnibus Subpoena
demonstrates both the scope and gravity of the DOJ’s Civil Investigation.
Walmart entered into a tolling agreement with the DOJ through
October 2019. Twenty DOJ attorneys in the Working Group met with Walmart in
person on December 14, 2018, February 27, 2019, and August 22, 2019, for a total
of approximately 12 hours.157
According to prosecutors, Walmart did not cooperate with the
Investigation. For example, Walmart never gave prosecutors a full list of doctors
that pharmacists were concerned about; Walmart did not give prosecutors full
information on its internal databases to analyze prescribing information and
patterns; and most importantly, Walmart refused to produce emails between
compliance officials and the Company’s senior management.158
156 Id. p. 5-6.
157 Id. p. 5.
158 ProPublica Article.
In August of 2019 Walmart learned that federal prosecutors were
preparing to indict Brad Nelson,159 the Walmart Compliance Director who refused
pharmacists’ desperate pleas to block prescribers who operated pill-mills and who
stated that “driving sales” was a better use of time than analyzing data to comply
with the 2011 MOA. In response, on September 27, 2019, Walmart’s counsel at
Jones Day wrote to Gus Eyler objecting to the threat of a Nelson indictment and
threatened to cease cooperating with the investigation.160
In the September 2019 Hewitt Letter Walmart also complained about
the Walmart Working Group’s request for all suspicious order reports submitted to
the DEA and corresponding internal remediation plans issued during one phase of
its Suspicious Order Monitoring Program. Walmart lamented that “the Company
[had] to comb through various custodians’ information to retrieve relevant data and
then compile the disparate information into an organized format.”161
Walmart successfully delayed federal prosecutor’s case against it by
improperly appealing to high-level officials in the DOJ. Joshua Russ resigned on
October 25, 2019. Russ stated in his resignation letter that Walmart “abused the
Department’s fairness, largely ignored our subpoena, and scoffed at our larger work
on behalf of all Americans.”
159 September 2019 Hewitt Letter, p. 8.
160 Id. p. 22.
161 Id. p. 6.
The same day that Russ resigned he filed a confidential whistleblower
complaint with the DOJ’s inspector general alleging interference by the DOJ’s
political leaders, stating that they blocked prosecutors’ efforts to obtain key
evidence and provided special treatment to Walmart.162 Despite the DEA’s sign-
off on the suit and despite opioid death victims being notified of the “landmark
multibillion-dollar lawsuit” against Walmart, Russ was, in his words “handcuffed
by political appointees.” Russ stated in an interview that he “wasn’t able to do the
key investigation into Walmart and that “Main Justice” interfered into his team’s
attempt to collect “key evidence core to the case.” Russ bluntly stated, “I had never
seen that in an investigation.”163
Having successfully interfered with the Investigations, Walmart next
attempted to preempt the DOJ’s eventual enforcement action by suing the DOJ and
the Attorney General in Federal Court in EDTX.
In the suit, Walmart asked the court to issue a declaratory judgment
clarifying the obligations of pharmacists to intervene if they suspect illegal
prescribing practices. Walmart’s interpretation would limit its liability and CSA
obligations.

trying to follow the evidence.,’ Dallas Business Journal, Sept. 9, 2021:

whistleblower-doj.html
163 Id.
In the suit Walmart sought to cast itself as the victim and shift blame
to federal regulators alleging that “DOJ and DEA should not be allowed to
outsource to pharmacists and pharmacies the job the DEA has failed to do” and the
“DEA’s comprehensive failures have dramatically exacerbated the opioid crisis
over at least the past twenty years.” Walmart further alleged, referring to the
Investigations, that “DOJ [s]pent [y]ears on an [i]nvestigation of Walmart [t]ainted
by [e]thical [t]ransgressions.”
On February 4, 2021 the court dismissed Walmart’s complaint.
Former U.S. Attorney Booth Godwin observed that “Walmart tried an end-around
and was tackled.” Bloomberg described the tactic as “a spectacular failure” in
“attempted forum shopping.” Reuters called “Walmart’s tactic [] a complete flop,”
that “did not stave off the DOJ’s complaint. Unsurprisingly, Walmart lost its appeal
to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.164
Despite Walmart’s attempts to obstruct the government’s case, the
DOJ filed its civil complaint on December 22, 2020.
Additionally, according to Walmart’s own representations to at least
one court, the DOJ’s criminal investigation into Walmart remained open through at
least October 2020. According to Walmart’s October 2020 representations to the
164 See Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 21 F.4th 300, 305 (5th Cir.
2021).
Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia in In re Opioid Litigation, Civil
Action No. 19-C-9000, the Criminal Investigation into Walmart continued even
after the declination.
In an October 20, 2020 order compelling Walmart to produce
documents related to government investigations the West Virginia court chastised
Walmart for its inconsistent positions concerning the status of the DOJ’s criminal
investigation. The court stated: “Plaintiffs point out that although Walmart
represents to this Court that the DOJ’s criminal investigation into it is ongoing,
Walmart has represented to at least one court that the investigation finished without
an indictment issuing. Walmart’s inconsistent representations to this court and
others concerning the status of the DOJ’s criminal investigation into it is
concerning, to say the least.”165
Defendants concealed from Investors the 2009 OTSC, the 2011 MOA,
the Criminal Investigation, and the Civil Investigation. Investors only learned of
the Investigations and the DEA/DOJ’s decade-long focus on Walmart’s CSA
violations from the ProPublica expose.

Walmart’s “Opioid Stewardship Initiative”
At the same time as Defendants were actively concealing the
intensifying Criminal Investigation Walmart launched a PR campaign touting the
Company’s purported efforts to combat the opioid crisis.
In early 2017 Walmart established the “Walmart Opioid Stewardship
Initiative” claiming that “the health and safety of [Walmart pharmacy] patients is a
critical priority.” Walmart’s Opioid Stewardship Initiative was an effort by Walmart
to portray itself to investors and the public as a good corporate citizen vis à vis the
opioid crisis and distinguish itself from other companies under fire for their roles in
the opioid crisis.
In Walmart’s webpage dedicated to its Opioid Stewardship Initiative,
Walmart states:
At Walmart, we see and feel the impact of the opioid crisis in the
communities we serve. Our mission is to help people “live better,” and
this means helping to fight the opioid crisis facing our country.
As part of our commitment, in early 2017, we established the Walmart
Opioid Stewardship Initiative to identify concrete, high-impact actions
to help fight the opioid epidemic. The Initiative focuses on supporting
solutions in three core areas:
Stewardship:
Adopting policies and practices to help safeguard our patients
Education:
Supporting education programs for our patients, pharmacists,
associates and communities
Advocacy:
Supporting legislation and public policy solutions aimed at reducing
opioid misuse and dependence. Our efforts, together with those of
governments at the state and federal levels and others in the private
sector, are beginning to yield results. But more work needs to be done.
We will continue working with individuals and organizations in our
communities to protect patients and families from the risks of
prescription opioid misuse and abuse.
Together, we can help make a difference.
Indeed, Walmart’s Opioid Stewardship Initiative garnered public
praise. The Oklahoma Attorney General, Mike Hunter stated “We appreciate good
corporate citizens like Walmart for serving as an example of how private businesses
can play a major role in ending this epidemic.”
On January 17, 2018 Walmart issued a press release titled “Walmart
Launches Groundbreaking Disposal Solution to Aid in Fight Against Opioid Abuse
and Misuse.” According to the press release:
In an effort to help curb abuse and misuse, Walmart is launching a first-
of-its-kind opioid disposal solution- available at no cost- in all company
pharmacies….
‘The health and safety of our patients is a critical priority; that’s why
we’re taking an active role in fighting our nation’s opioid issue- an issue
that’s affected so many families and communities across America,’ said
Marybeth Hays, executive vice president of Consumables and Health
and Wellness at Walmart U.S. ‘While this issue requires many
resources to solve, we are confident this unique, easy-to-use disposal
solution, DisposeRx, will make a meaningful impact on the lives of
many. Walmart is incredibly proud to fund this initiative that provides
our patients with an opioid disposal solution they can access
nationwide, at no cost.’
On May 7, 2018- just days after Walmart’s two-day meeting with
federal prosecutors from Texas who informed Walmart of their intent to
“imminently indict the Company-” Walmart issued a press release titled “Walmart
Introduces Additional Measures to Help Curb Opioid Abuse and Misuse.” The press
release stated:
Walmart, Inc. supports policies and programs aimed at helping curb
opioid abuse and misuse…In an effort to continue to be part of the
solution to our nation’s opioid epidemic, Walmart is introducing new
policies, programs and tools aimed at curbing opioid misuse and
abuse…
‘We are taking action in the fight against the nation’s opioid epidemic,’
said Marybeth Hays, executive vice president of Health & Wellness and
Consumables, Walmart U.S. ‘We are proud to implement these policies
and initiatives as we work to create solutions that address this critical
issue facing the patients and communities we serve.’
Walmart’s Opioid Stewardship Initiative was an effort by Walmart to
portray itself to investors and the public as a good corporate citizen vis à vis the
opioid crisis and distinguish itself from other companies under fire for their roles in
the opioid crisis.
Walmart’s Actions in Connection with its Membership in the National
Association of Chain Drug Stores
The plaintiffs in the Opioid MDL allege that the “Distributor
Defendants” (consisting of companies that distributed opioids) were members of
the Healthcare Distribution Alliance (“HDA”) and that the “Pharmacy Defendants”
(which includes Walmart) and the Distributor Defendants were members of the
National Association of Chain Drug Stores (“NACDS”).
The Opioid MDL Plaintiffs alleged that Walmart and other members
used the HDA and NACDS to protect the supply chain of opioids through various
means, including: (1) Drafting a “best practices” model for dealing with “suspicious
orders,” better known as the Industry Compliance Guidelines (“ICGs”), as a ruse to
avoid regulatory enforcement; (2) Coordinating to invalidate enforcement actions;
(3) Coordinating to fight the stricter controls for hydrocodone combination products
and (4) Circumventing the DEA through the creation of a coalition on controlled
substances that aimed to limit the scope of DEA restrictions on their continued
distribution of controlled substances.
In denying Walmart and the other MDL Defendants’ summary
judgment motions on plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy claims, Judge Polster held that the
evidence showed that the Pharmacy Defendants: (i) used their membership and
leadership positions in NACDS and their relationship with Distributor Defendants
to “grow and protect the Opioid Supply Chain,” (ii) coordinated with Distributor
Defendants to form a “coalition” on controlled substances to limit the scope of DEA
regulations on the distribution of controlled substances, and (iii) worked “in
partnership” with the HDA to develop “solutions to the DEA enforcement issues”
and “strategies” concerning “ongoing problems that NACDS members are having
with DEA enforcement actions.”166
Post-Class Period Events Confirm Walmart’s CSA Violations and
Defendants’ Efforts to Conceal the Investigations
Walmart has gone to great lengths to conceal the details of the Criminal
Investigation and the PowerPoint presentations Defendant McMillon helped
prepare in connection with Walmart’s attempts to convince the DOJ not to indict
the Company. For example, the discovery order in the Opioid MDL required that
Walmart produce all documents it produced in other related opioid litigations,
including government investigations. In the Opioid MDL, Walmart objected to
producing the PowerPoint presentations to the DOJ that McMillon provided input
into and reviewed based on F.R.E. 408 and 410- despite having produced them in a
Massachusetts litigation four weeks prior. In granting the MDL plaintiffs’ motion
to compel production of the PowerPoint presentations, and sanctioning Walmart’s
improper discovery conduct, the MDL Court stated, in an April 19, 2021 order that:
“Walmart’s excuses for not timely producing this discovery require
convoluted or illogical understandings of the Court’s clear and repeated
messages to the parties. It is vexatious for Walmart to reach and
pretend to see exceptions where none exist, and then use these
166 Opioid MDL, 17-MD-002804, (Sept. 3, 2019) (Dkt. No. 2562). 2019 WL
4178610, at *5 (Exhibit C).
phantom exceptions as a means to delay or avoid complying with clear
Court Orders.167
The MDL Court further noted Walmart’s repeated attempts to cabin
discovery stating: “Defendants’ obligation has been set forth with clear language
for three years, and the Court has rejected each attempt since by Defendants to
suggest the obligation should be constrained.168
The first trial in the Opioid MDL lasted six weeks. On November 23,
2021 the jury returned its verdict, finding Walmart guilty of creating a public
nuisance in connection with its dispensing and distribution of opioids. Specifically,
the jury answered “Yes” as to “Walmart” in response to the questions: 1) “Did
Trumbull County prove, by the greater weight of the evidence, that oversupply of
legal prescription opioids, and diversion of those opioids onto the illicit market
outside of appropriate medical channels, is a public nuisance…” and 2) Did
Trumbull County prove, by the greater weight of the evidence, that any of the
following Defendants169 engaged in intentional and/or illegal conduct which was a
167 Order Granting Motion to Compel and for Sanctions, Opioid MDL, 1:17-MD-

additional Defendants are CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and Walgreen, Co. The jury also
found CVS and Walgreens guilty.
substantial factor in producing the public nuisance that you found exists in Question
1?”170
Following the guilty verdict Walmart engaged in failed attempts to
have the jury verdict overturned and/or have the case retried. After extensive
briefing on F.R.C.P. 59 and 60 motions, the MDL Court concluded that: (1) the
verdict was supported by the weight of the evidence (2) defendants were not entitled
to a new trial.171
The core facts the Opioid MDL plaintiffs alleged and proved are the
same core facts that formed the basis for the Government’s case against Walmart,
and date all the way back to the 2011 MOA. For example, the Opioid MDL
Plaintiffs alleged that Walmart “had the ability and the obligation to look for red
flags on a patient prescriber, and store level, and to refuse to fill and to report
prescriptions that suggested illegal diversion,” yet “systematically ignored red flags
that were fueling a black market.” Walmart allegedly failed to:
- “adequately train their pharmacists and pharmacy technicians on
how to properly and adequately handle prescriptions for opioid
painkillers”;
- “put in place effective policies and procedures to prevent their stores
from facilitating diversion and selling into a black market”;
170 Jury Verdict (Exh. D), p. 2-4; 6-8.
171 Abatement Order (Exh. E), p. 6-7.
- “conduct adequate internal or external reviews of their opioid sales
to identify patterns regarding prescriptions that should not have been
filled”;
- “effectively respond to concerns raised by their own employees
regarding inadequate policies and procedures regarding the filling of
opioid prescriptions”; and
- “take meaningful action to investigate or to ensure that they were
complying with their duties and obligations under the law with regard
to controlled substances.”
These are the same deficiencies that Walmart promised to address in
the 2011 MOA, but did not.
The Opioid MDL plaintiffs also alleged (and proved) that as a
distributor of controlled substances Walmart failed to “control the supply chain,
prevent diversion, report suspicious orders, and halt shipments” despite being “in
possession of national, regional, state, and local prescriber and patient-level data
that allowed them to track prescribing patters over time.” As a distributor Walmart
also “refused to identify, investigate and report suspicious orders to the DEA when
they came aware of the same despite their actual knowledge of drug diversion
rings.”
On August 17, 2022 the MDL Court issued an Abatement Order setting
forth Walmart’s penalty and mandating Walmart take certain actions to abate the
public nuisance the jury found it guilty of. The Abatement Order held that Walmart,
CVS, and Walgreens must pay a total of $650.6 million over the course of 15 years
and immediately fund two-years’ worth of payments ($86.7 million for Walmart)
into an Abatement Fund.172
In the Abatement Order, the MDL Court held that because “the
evidence presented in the Phase I trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that
Defendants’ underlying dispensing conduct was both knowing and intentional”
joint and several liability was appropriate.173 Accordingly, Walmart’s share of the
penalty is $216,866,667.
As part of the Abatement Order the MDL Court also entered an
Injunction Order directing Walmart (and CVS and Walgreens) to “undertake certain
actions to ensure that they are complying fully with the Controlled Substances Act
and avoiding further improper dispensing conduct.”174 The Injunction Order
requires, among other things, that Walmart implement and maintain a Controlled
Substance Compliance Program (“CSCP”), comply with the applicable federal and
Ohio state laws regarding dispensing of Controlled Substances, and designate an
independent Chief Controlled Substance Compliance Officer who completes an
annual compliance certification.175 The term of the Injunctive Order is 15 years.176

174 Abatement Order p. 4, fourth bullet point.
175 Abatement Order at Ex. A, p. 1-5, 13).
176 Abatement Order at Ex. A, p. 3.
Further, the MDL Court specifically found that Walmart’s wrongful
conduct was ongoing, stating that “the ongoing, unreasonable interference with
public health in this case is complicated and multi-faceted, and consists of both
Defendants’ ongoing conduct and the resulting nuisance-causing conditions. An
order to meaningfully abate the nuisance the jury found will require the Court to
carefully craft both: (1) injunctive relief to stop the Defendants’ wrongful
dispensing conduct, so they can no longer cause oversupply of legal prescription
opioids that can be diverted, while still allowing appropriate dispensing; and (2) an
abatement plan to reduce the prevalence of OUD177 in the Counties, thereby
ameliorating the ongoing interference with public health.” (emphasis original).178
Walmart remained defiant and obstinate to the bitter end, ignoring the
MDL Court’s order to submit its own proposed abatement plan. The MDL Court
found that Walmart (and the other Pharmacy Defendants):
largely ignored the Court’s directives to submit their own proposed
abatement plan, and not to merely attack and criticize Plaintiffs’
proposed abatement plan. Despite the Court’s order that the parties each
propose a detailed plan for abatement, only the Plaintiffs proposed one.
Upon further order compelling them to submit a plan, Defendants
eventually submitted three paragraphs suggesting a proper abatement
remedy would be comprised of drug takeback programs to facilitate
disposal of diverted opioids—and nothing more. But Defendants did
not produce any evidence at the Abatement Trial, either through their
own witnesses or through cross-examination of Plaintiffs’ experts, that
177 Opioid Use Disorder.
178 Abatement Order p. 25.
would support a finding that drug takeback programs, standing alone,
would effectively abate the nuisance in the Counties. Defendants,
instead, chose to challenge the legal validity, rather than the practical
effectiveness, of all or various portions of Plaintiff’s plan.179
SEC Rules and Regulations and Accounting Principles Governing
Defendants’ Class Period Disclosures
SEC rules and regulations govern the content and preparation of
disclosures public companies make in SEC filings.
GAAP are principles recognized by the accounting profession as the
conventions, rules, and procedures necessary to define accepted accounting
practices at a particular time. Compliance with GAAP is a fundamental obligation
of publicly traded companies. As set forth in SEC Rule 4-01(a) of SEC Regulation
S-X, “[f]inancial statements filed with the [SEC] which are not prepared in
accordance with [GAAP] will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate.” 17
C.F.R. § 210.4-01(a)(1).
A. Item 103
Item 103 of Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.103 (“Item 103”)
specifically required Walmart’s 10-K’s and 10-Q’s to disclose “any [material legal]
proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities.
179 Abatement Order p. 9.
Specifically, Item 103 requires companies to disclose any material
pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the
business, including “any such proceedings known to be contemplated by
governmental authorities.” Such disclosure must include: (i) the name of the court
or agency in which the proceedings are pending, (ii) the date instituted, (iii) the
principal parties thereto and (iv) a description of the factual basis alleged to underlie
the proceedings and the relief sought. Similar information for contemplated
proceedings must be disclosed. 17. C.F.R. §229.103(a).
Item 103 provides a disclosure threshold for pending and contemplated
proceedings that involve primarily a claim for damages for which the amount of
damages involved, exclusive of interests and costs, does not exceed 10% of the
company’s current assets. Companies must aggregate similar legal proceedings (i.e.
proceedings that “present in large degree the same [legal and factual] issues”). The
10% disclosure threshold applies to both pending legal proceedings and legal
proceedings known to be contemplated, when applying the 10% disclosure
threshold. 17. C.F.R. §229.103(a)(2)(b)(2).
Because EDTX DOJ was intending to file criminal charges, the DOJ’s
claims did not “primarily involve a claim for damages.” Indeed, Walmart itself
recognized in the 2014 PSW detailing the need to have a functioning SOM system
that the risks of failing to comply with the 2011 MOA “include potential DEA
enforcement which, could include fines, penalties and license forfeiture, as well as
failure to secure VAWD reaccreditation.”
By the beginning of the Class Period Defendants were aware of the
Criminal Investigation into the Company for its failure to comply with the CSA and
the 2011 MOA. Defendants were also aware of: 1) the existence of the 2011 MOA
2) the 2013 Whistleblower Complaint and 3) Walmart’s failure to comply with the
2011 MOA and the CSA because, according to the June 2014 PSW: 1. Walmart
had failed to comply with the 2011 MOA, 2. Walmart’s suspicious order monitoring
system was an “existing risk” for which the Company had “no processes in place”
which was “likely” to result in “severe financial and reputational” harm to the
Company, and 3. Walmart’s suspicious order monitoring program required
substantial enhancements in order “to help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a
result of non-compliance with [the CSA].”
In violation of Item 103, Walmart’s Class Period quarterly and annual
reports filed with the SEC failed to disclose the Criminal Investigation (and later
the parallel Civil Investigation). Item 103 required Defendants to disclose the
Criminal Investigation because it threatened a criminal indictment which is not an
action for damages and is clearly material to the Company. Further, Item 103
required Defendants to disclose the Civil Investigation as a “similar legal
proceeding[ ]” to the Opioid MDL. Defendants violated Item 103 by disclosing the
Opioid MDL but failing to aggregate those claims with the DOJ’s contemplated
civil claims. Had Walmart aggregated the two claims as required, then Walmart
would have specifically disclosed the Investigations alongside the Opioid MDL in
its Class Period 10-K’s and 10-Q’s. It did not.
B. ASC 450
GAAP, and specifically Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450 (“ASC 450”),
Contingencies, also required disclosure of the Criminal Investigation and Civil
Investigation.
ASC 450 requires disclosure in the footnotes to a Company’s financial
statements of material loss contingencies and/or significant risk and uncertainties.180
Under ASC 450, disclosing a loss contingency181 is required when there is more
than a remote chance that a loss will be incurred. The threshold for disclosure of a
loss contingency (as opposed to a higher threshold for the accrual of a loss
180 ASC 450 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies) defines a loss contingency as “[a]n existing
condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to [a] possible
loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events
occur or fail to occur.”
181 ASC 450 defines a contingent liability or loss contingency as “an existing
condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible
loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events
occur or fail to occur.” ASC 450-20-20.
contingency) is very low – ASC 450 requires disclosure only when the loss is
“[r]easonably possible,” which is defined as, “[t]he chance of the future event or
events occurring is more than remote but less than likely.”182
Under ASC 450, the disclosure shall indicate the nature of the
contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or state that such
an estimate cannot be made.183
ASC 450 specifically addresses the disclosure of “pending or
threatened litigation,” stating that when “determining whether accrual and/or
disclosure is required with respect to pending or threatened litigation,” companies
must consider: (i) “[t]he period in which the underlying cause (i.e., the cause for
action) of the pending or threatened litigation or of the actual or possible claim or
assessment occurred”; (ii) “[t]he degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome”;
and (iii) “[t]he ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.”184 ASC
450 adds that:
With respect to unasserted claims and assessments, an enterprise must
determine the degree of probability that a suit may be filed or a claim or
assessment may be asserted and the possibility of an unfavorable
outcome. . . . [A]n investigation of an enterprise by a governmental
agency, if enforcement proceedings have been or are likely to be
instituted, is often followed by private claims for redress, and the
182 ASC 450-20-20; ASC 450-20-50-3; ASC 450-20-50-4.
183 ASC 450-20-50-6.
184 ASC 450-20-55-10.
probability of their assertion and the possibility of loss should be
considered in each case.185
Actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened
litigation are sources of significant potential liability for a public company. ASC
450 requires disclosure of a contingency involving an unasserted claim or
assessment when there is a manifestation by a potential claimant of awareness of a
possible claim or assessment. Even when where there is no manifestation by a
potential claimant of awareness of a possible claim or assessment, disclosure is
nevertheless required if it is probable that a claim will be asserted and there is
a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable.186
Finally, the SEC considers the disclosure of loss contingencies of such
importance to an informed investment decision that it issued Article 10-01 of
Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. § 210.10-01, which provides that disclosures in interim
period financial statements may be abbreviated and need not duplicate the
disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements, except
that “where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be
provided even though a significant change since year end may not have occurred.”
By the beginning of the Class Period Defendants were aware of: (i) the
Criminal Investigation; (ii) the 2011 MOA; (iii) that Walmart had violated the 2011
185 ASC 450-55-14b.
186 ASC 450-20-50-6a-b.
MOA by failing to comply with its terms and (iv) the Company’s CSA violations.
Defendants were required to disclose the DOJ Investigation and provide an estimate
of the potential liability pursuant to ASC 450 in Walmart’s 2017 10-K, and in all of
the Company’s Class Period quarterly and annual reports thereafter because: (i) the
DOJ had manifested an awareness of a potential material criminal action against the
Company and (ii) Defendants were aware that it was at least reasonably possible
that the outcome would be unfavorable, given: (a) the Company’s CSA violations
and (b) the Company’s failure to comply with the 2011 MOA.
Defendants’ Class Period False and Misleading Statements and
Omissions of Facts that the Company Was Required to Disclose
A. Defendants’ False and Misleading Statements Concerning
Disclosure of All Reasonably Possible Liabilities that “May” Be
Material
The Class Period begins on March 31, 2017, when Walmart filed its
2016 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 (“2016 10-K”). In the 2016
10-K Defendants affirmatively misrepresented that they had disclosed all legal
proceedings where a liability is “reasonably possible” and “may be material.”
Walmart’s 2016 10-K financial statements, note 10 titled
“Contingencies” states:
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The
Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where
appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has
not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and
may be material, such matters have been disclosed.
By the time Walmart filed the 2016 10-K on March 31, 2017,
Defendants had learned of the Criminal Investigation and had received an email
search warrant from the Assistant US Attorney in EDTX. Defendants’ statement
purporting to disclose all reasonably possible legal proceedings that “may” be
material was false and materially misleading and omitted material facts necessary
to make it not misleading because Defendants omitted to disclose the Criminal
Investigation. Defendants were aware that a material liability stemming from the
Criminal Investigation was at least reasonably possible given Defendants’
awareness of: (1) the 2011 MOA which essentially placed Walmart on “probation”
for its CSA violations; (2) Walmart’s failure to comply with the 2011 MOA and
CSA as evidenced by, inter alia the 2014 PSW which stated that the potential for
reputational and financial harm stemming from the 2011 MOA and Walmart’s
failure to comply with the CSA was greater than material, it was severe.
Further, by specifically disclosing certain legal proceedings and
investigations while omitting to disclose the Criminal Investigation, Defendants
essentially denied its existence.
Defendants repeated the statement in ¶290 above in Walmart’s June 2,
2017 quarterly report for the first quarter of 2017 ended April 30, 2017 (“1Q 2017
10-Q”); Walmart’s August 31 2017, quarterly report for the second quarter ended
July 31, 2017 (“2Q 2017 10-Q”); and Walmart’s December 1, 2017 10-Q for the
third quarter ended October 31, 2017 (“3Q 2017 10-Q”) which were false and
misleading for the reasons stated in ¶¶291-92 above.
On December 1, 2017 the Company filed its 10-Q for the third quarter
ended October 31, 2017 (“3Q 2017 10-Q”). By the time Walmart filed the 3Q 2017
10-Q Defendants were aware that EDTX DOJ was conducting a parallel civil
investigation in addition to the Criminal Investigation. In Walmart’s 3Q 2017 10-Q
Defendants repeated the statement concerning disclosure of legal proceedings set
forth in ¶290 above. Defendants’ statement was false and materially misleading
and omitted material facts necessary to make it not misleading for the reasons set
forth in ¶¶291-92 above and for the additional reason that Defendants omitted to
disclose the DOJ’s parallel Civil Investigation which began in November 2017.
On March 30, 2018, the Company filed its annual report on Form 10-
K with the SEC for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 (“2017 10-K”). By now
Defendants were aware of the EDTX DOJ’s intent to indict Walmart.
The 2017 10-K states the following under Note 10. “Contingencies:”
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The
Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where
appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has
not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and
may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may
enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may
enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best
interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided
adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.
In addition to other legal proceedings and investigations the 10-K
disclosed the MDL:
National Prescription Opiate Litigation
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation ordered consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide
array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,
healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-
party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of
widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is
entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804),
and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases
included in this multidistrict litigation, including cases filed by several
counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi,
Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. Croix Chippewa Indians
of Wisconsin. Similar cases that name the Company have been filed in
state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health care
providers; and by various Native American Tribes. The Company
cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot
reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such
claims. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal
defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.
The foregoing statements purporting to disclose all reasonably possible
legal proceedings that may be material was false and materially misleadingly and
omitted to disclose material information necessary to make it not misleading
because Defendants failed to disclose the Criminal Investigation and parallel Civil
Investigation. Defendants were aware that a material liability stemming from the
Investigations was at least reasonably possible given Defendants’ awareness of the
foregoing facts: (i) On March 28, 2018 Assistant U.S. Attorney Rattan notified
Walmart that she intended to indict the Company, (ii) the EDTX DOJ had now
expanded its criminal investigation into Walmart and had sent Walmart a broadened
information request in June 2017 and five DEA Administrative Subpoenas between
June 2017 to July 2018; (iii) Walmart violated the 2011 MOA and recognized that
the potential for reputational and financial harm stemming from the 2011 MOA and
Walmart’s failure to comply with the CSA was greater than material, it was severe.
On June 4, 2018 the Company filed its 10-Q for the first quarter 2018
ending April 30, 2018 (“1Q 2018 10-Q”). The 1Q 2018 stated the following under
Note 9. “Contingencies:”
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The
Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where

National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation ordered numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of
defendants by various plaintiffs be consolidated, including counties,
cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, and third-party
payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of
widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is
entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804),
and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases
included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the
Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and
municipalities; by health care providers; and by various Native
American Tribes. The relief sought by various plaintiffs is
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief
including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such
claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or
range of loss that may arise from such claims. The Company believes
it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends
to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been
responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations
from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled
substance dispensing practices involving the sale of opioids. The
Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of
these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial
condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely
affected.
By the time Walmart filed its 1Q 2018 10-Q on June 4, 2018
Defendants were aware that in May 2018 U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas told Walmart that it would imminently indict the Company and it should pay
a billion dollars to resolve the matter civilly ,and subsequently acknowledged that
an indictment would have a “profound” negative impact on shareholders, including
“the loss of billions of dollars in the value of Walmart shares.” The foregoing
statements purporting to disclose all “reasonably possible” material liabilities and
vague reference to “subpoenas, information requests and investigations from
governmental entities” were false and materially misleading and omitted material
information necessary to make them not misleading because Defendants did not
specifically disclose the Investigations and concealed from investors the nature and
scope of the Investigations.
After improperly exploiting its access to high-level DOJ officials, on
August 31, 2018 the DOJ informed Walmart it would decline, at that time, to
criminally prosecute the Company. Nevertheless, in September 2018 AUSA Rattan
told Walmart the Criminal Investigation remained ongoing and that Walmart should
continue to comply with the DEA’s subpoenas. Further, the Civil Investigation
remained ongoing.
Defendants repeated the statements in statements in ¶299 above in
Walmart’s September 6, 2018 quarterly report on Form 10-Q the quarter 2018 ended
July 31, 2018 (“2Q 2018 10-Q).
The statements in Walmart’s 2Q 2018 10-Q were false and materially
misleading when made and omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make
them not misleading because Defendants did not specifically disclose Civil
Investigation and concealed from investors the nature and scope of the
Investigation.
Defendants repeated the statements in ¶299 above in Walmart’s
November 30, 2018 quarterly report for the quarter ended October 31, 2018 (“3Q
2018 10-Q”).
By the time Walmart filed its 3Q 2018 10-Q on November 30, 2018
Defendants were aware that the DOJ had formed a Working Group consisting of 15
separate U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and three litigating components of the DOJ to
continue investigating Walmart for civil violations of the CSA. Accordingly,
Defendants were aware that a material liability stemming from the Civil
Investigation was at least reasonably possible for this additional reason, which
demonstrated to Defendants that the DOJ had expanded and intensified its
Investigation. The statements in Walmart’s 3Q 2018 10-Q were false and materially
misleading when made and omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make
them not misleading because Defendants did not specifically disclose the Civil
Investigation and concealed from investors the nature and scope of the
Investigation.
Defendants repeated the statements in ¶299 above in Walmart’s March
30, 2019 annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC for the fiscal year ended January
31, 2019 (“2018 10-K”) and Walmart’s June 7, 2019 quarterly report on Form 10-
Q for the period ended April 30, 2019 (“1Q 2019 10-Q”).
By the time Walmart filed its 2018 10-K on March 31, 2019
Defendants were aware that the Working Group conducting the Civil Investigation
issued an Omnibus Subpoena to Walmart seeking evidence across 36 broad
categories relating to dispensing and distribution of controlled substances, including
records of all prescriptions filled in the Working Group’s 15 districts over a five
year period; prescription records for all prescribers who have been corporately
blocked by Walmart, alone with 329 additional prescribers over a five-year period;
and all witness statements, transcripts, pleading and discovery materials Walmart
produced in the Opioid MDL. Accordingly, Defendants were aware that a material
liability stemming from the Civil Investigation was at least reasonably possible for
this additional reason, which demonstrated to Defendants that the DOJ had further
expanded and intensified its Investigation. The statements in Walmart’s 2018 10-K
and 1Q 2019 were false and materially misleading when made and omitted to
disclose material facts necessary to make them not misleading because Defendants
did not specifically disclose the Civil Investigation and concealed from investors
the nature and scope of the Investigation.
Defendants repeated the statements in ¶299 above in Walmart’s
September 6, 2019 quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31,
2019 (“2Q 2019 10-Q”); Walmart’s December 4, 2019 quarterly report on Form 10-
Q for the period ended October 31, 2019 (“3Q 2019 10-Q”); and Walmart’s March
20, 2020 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (“2019 10-K”).
By the time Walmart filed its 2Q 2019 10-Q on September 6, 2019
Defendants were aware that federal prosecutors were preparing to indict former
Walmart Compliance Director Brad Nelson (whom EDTX had planned to indict
alongside Walmart as a co-conspirator prior to the declination) and was concerned
about the impact of Nelson’s indictment on Walmart.187 Accordingly, Defendants
were aware that a material liability stemming from the Civil Investigation was at
least reasonably possible for this additional reason. The statements in Walmart’s 2Q
187 September 2019 Hewitt Letter, p. 3-4.
2019 10-Q, 3Q 2019 10-Q and 2019 10-K were false and materially misleading
when made and omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make them not
misleading because Defendants did not specifically disclose Civil Investigation and
concealed from investors the nature and scope of the Investigation.
Defendants’ intention to conceal the Investigations from investors is
evidenced by their disclosure of “Certain other matters” in Walmart’s 2019 10-K:
II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: The Company has received
grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for
the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the
Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering
compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where
Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in January
The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The
Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from
the United States Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers
and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage
of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the
investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does
not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to
the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business,
financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be
materially adversely affected.
Unlike the disclosure above, in which Defendants provided detailed
information setting forth the nature and subject matter of the investigation, the
governmental entity conducting the investigation and the date a subpoena was
issued, Defendants’ vague disclosure of “subpoenas, information requests and
investigations from governmental entities subpoenas and information” (in
Walmart’s 1Q 2018 10-Q and each of Walmart’s Class Period 10-Q’s and 10-K’s
thereafter) misled investors and deprived them of material information necessary to
made Defendants’ existing statements not misleading.
B. Defendants’ Violations of ASC 450
ASC 450 requires a company to disclose a loss contingency if there is
more than a remote chance that a loss will occur. Such as disclosure must indicate
the nature of the liability and provide an estimate or estimate a range of the amount
of the liability. ASC 450 requires a company to accrue a charge on its financial
statements or “account” for a contingent liability where the liability is probable.
Defendants did not disclose the Criminal Investigation or the Civil
Investigation in any of Walmart’s Class Period 10-K’s and 10-Q’s, in violation of
ASC 450. Because Defendants knowingly failed to disclose a loss contingency in
Walmart’s financial statements, including the nature of the possible loss, the
financial statements contained in Walmart’s Class Period 10-K’s and 10-Q’s were
materially false and misleading.
By the beginning of the Class Period (March 31, 2017) Defendants
were aware of the Criminal Investigation which began after the DEA raided a
Walmart store. Accordingly, Defendants were required to disclose the Criminal
Investigation in Walmart’s 2016 10-K pursuant to ASC 450 because: (i) Defendants
were aware that the DOJ manifested an awareness of a potential material claim
against Walmart when it commenced the Criminal Investigation into the Company’s
alleged CSA violation on December 7, 2016 and (ii) it was at least reasonably
possible that the Criminal Investigation would result in Walmart incurring a
material liability. Because Defendants knowingly failed to disclose a loss
contingency in Walmart’s financial statements, including the nature of the possible
loss, the financial statements contained in Walmart’s 2016 10-K were false and
misleading.
By the time Walmart filed its 1Q 2017 10-Q on June 2, 2017 EDTX
DOJ had now expanded the Criminal Investigation into Walmart and had sent
Walmart a broadened information request, increasing the likelihood that Walmart
would incur a material liability as a result of the Criminal Investigation. ASC 450
required Defendants to disclose the Criminal Investigation for this additional
reason.
By the time Walmart filed its 3Q 2017 10-Q on December 1, 2017
Defendants were now aware that AUSA Russ had commenced a parallel civil
investigation and Walmart was responding to broad information requests in
connection therewith. Accordingly, ASC 450 required Defendants to disclose the
Civil Investigation as well as the Criminal Investigation.
By the time Walmart filed its 2017 10-K on March 30, 2018
Defendants were aware of the EDTX DOJ’s intention to indict Walmart.
Accordingly, ASC 450 required Defendants to disclose the Criminal Investigation
for the additional reason that on March 28, 2018 the AUSA informed Walmart it
intended to indict the Company.
By the time Walmart filed its 1Q 2018 10-Q on June 4, 2018
Defendants were aware that U.S. Attorney for EDTX told Walmart that it would
imminently indict the Company and stated that Walmart should pay a billion dollars
to resolve the matter civilly. Walmart’s top lawyer acknowledged that an indictment
would have a “profound” negative impact on shareholders, including “the loss of
billions of dollars in the value of Walmart shares.” Accordingly, ASC 450 required
Defendants to disclose the Criminal Investigation and the Civil Investigation for
these additional reasons.
After improperly exploiting its access to high-level DOJ officials on
August 31, 2018 the DOJ informed Walmart it would decline to criminally
prosecute the Company at that time. Nevertheless, in September 2018 AUSA Rattan
told Walmart the Criminal Investigation remained ongoing and that Walmart should
continue to comply with the DEA’s subpoenas. Further, the Civil Investigation
remained ongoing. Accordingly, even after the declination ASC 450 required
Defendants to disclose the Civil Investigation in Walmart’s 2Q 2018 10-Q, 3Q-
2018 10-Q, 2018 10-K, 1Q 2019 10-Q, 2Q 2019 10-Q, 3Q 2019 10-Q and 2019 10-
K.
C. Defendants Violations of the Affirmative Disclosure Obligations
Imposed by Item 103.
Item 103 requires companies to disclose any material pending legal
proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business,
including “any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental
authorities.”
Defendants violated the affirmative disclosure obligations Item 103
imposes by failing to disclose the Investigations in Walmart’s Class Period SEC
filings because the Investigations were material legal proceedings known to be
contemplated by a governmental authority. Further, Item 103 requires, in the case
of “any proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities,”
Defendants to disclose: (i) the name of the court or agency in which the proceedings
are pending, (ii) the date instituted, the principal parties thereto and (iii) a
description of the factual basis alleged to underlie the proceeding and the relief
sought. Despite Defendants’ awareness that: (i) the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Eastern District of Texas was contemplating indicting the Company, (ii) the
contemplated indictment stemmed from the Criminal Investigation which the
EDTX DOJ began on December 7, 2016; (iii) the claims in the Criminal
Investigation were based on Walmart’s decade long violations of the CSA and
related laws (iv) Walmart began responding to broad information requests in
connection with a parallel Civil Investigation which Walmart learned of in
November 2017l and (v) the DOJ was seeking criminal relief and a billion dollars
to resolve the matter civilly, Defendants failed to disclose any of this required
information.
D. Defendants’ False and Misleading Portrayal of Walmart as a
“Steward” in the Opioid Crisis
On October 26, 2017 Walmart issued a Press Release titled “Walmart
Supports State of Emergency Declaration on Opioids- Company pledges to continue
measures in addressing the nation’s prescription drug abuse crisis” (“October 26,
2017 Press Release”). The October 26, 2017 Press Release stated, in relevant part:
Walmart, including its 5,300 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies,
expressed support for the administration’s declaration of a public health
emergency on opioids and reinforced the company’s commitment to be
part of the solution to the epidemic.
‘At Walmart, the health and safety of our patients is a critical priority,
and we welcome the administration’s actions to bring attention and
resources to the nation’s opioid issue- one that has devastated so many
families and communities across America,’ said Greg Foran, president
and chief executive officer, Walmart U.S. ‘We stand ready to work
with our nation’s leaders on a solution to combat prescription drug
addiction and misuse.’
As a company, Walmart has taken steps to help address the
prescription drug abuse problem, including:
The Company has comprehensive policies and training to help
support its pharmacists in filling prescriptions only for legitimate
medical purposes.
…
The foregoing statements in the October 26, 2017 Press Release were
false and materially misleading when made and/or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements not misleading because the Company’s policies
were specifically designed to prevent pharmacists from refusing to fill illegitimate
prescriptions because, for example: Walmart chose not to disseminate compiled
“red flag” information to its pharmacists, Walmart pressured pharmacists to fill
prescriptions as quickly as possible, Walmart refused to allow pharmacists to refuse
to fill, as a blanket matter, all prescriptions issued by “pill-mill” prescribers, and
Walmart failed to adequately train pharmacists concerning red-flag identification.
Additionally, at Walmart, the “health and safety of our patients” was not a “critical
priority.” Instead, “driving sales” and filling prescriptions as quickly as possible-
despite dangers to patient health and safety- so that customers would continue to
shop at Walmart and Sam’s Club was Walmart’s “critical priority.” Further,
Walmart did not comprehensively train its pharmacists. Instead, as the DOJ
Complaint alleges, Walmart pharmacists “received little training before 2018 on
how to handle prescriptions raising red flags” and “Walmart provided its staff with
no training program, training materials, or written policies, procedures, or criteria
specific to suspicious order monitoring.”188
Further, Defendants’ issuance of the October 2017 Press Release at a
time when other pharmaceutical companies and distributors were coming under fire
for playing a role in the opioid crisis, was a conscious attempt to distance Walmart
from the crisis and any illegal conduct and mislead investors.
In short, the October 2017 Press Release was a false exculpatory
statement indicating Walmart’s scienter as to its unlawful role in causing and
exacerbating the opioid crisis in the United States.
E. Defendants’ False and Misleading Risk Disclosures
Item 105 of Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.105 (“Item 105”) (as
amended November 9, 2020) requires a company to provide a discussion of the
material factors that make an investment in the registrant speculative or risky. The
SEC also requires that a registrant’s Form 10-Q set forth any material changes from
risk factors as previously disclosed in the registrant’s last Form 10-K.
188 DOJ Complaint, ¶¶ 357.
Walmart’s 2016 10-K filed on March 31 2017set forth “numerous” risk
factors related to Walmart’s retail pharmacy operations under “Item 1A Risk
Factors”:
Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could
adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and
liquidity.
The retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club
segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are
generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment
established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and
payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental
agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks,
including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs;
changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our
pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward
plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes
in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription
drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive
preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or
exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network
arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program;
increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription
drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burden associated with
seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with
which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to
consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for
existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug
competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs
customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics);
changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope
of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs;
increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further
consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs;
overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers
to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not
reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or
incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement
may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail
pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a
result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and
implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws,
rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of
vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations
could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a
new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could
cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our
pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other
pharmacies.
One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes
of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales
associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and
gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -
club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net
sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Defendants repeated and/or incorporated by reference substantially the
same risk disclosures in Walmart’s 1Q 2017 10-Q, 2Q 2017 10-Q and Walmart’s
3Q 2017 10-Q.
Defendants’ statements regarding the “numerous risks” Walmart’s
retail pharmacy business faced were false and materially misleading when made
and omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading
because while disclosing the above risks Defendants concealed the much larger
risks that the DOJ would criminally and/or civilly prosecute Walmart and that
Walmart would be subject to billions of dollars in fines and penalties and severe
reputational harm, among other things, as a result of failing to comply with the CSA.
Walmart’s 2017 10-K filed on March 31, 2018 purported to set forth
the following “risk factors” related to Walmart’s pharmacy business. The 2017 10-
K states the following under the heading “Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance,
Reputational and other Risks:”
We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and
in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely
affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related
interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements
and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our
pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous
federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other
requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The
regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to:
federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies;
dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing
pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including
Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the
Affordable Care Act or any successor thereto; laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety
matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management
and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and
drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the "DEA"),
trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including
those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state
regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement
and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer;
anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws
governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the
professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.
For example, in the United States the DEA and various other
regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of
pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold
valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and
operating standards and comply with the federal and various state
controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale,
dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled
substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have
broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall
products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative
sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also
governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability,
including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and
safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and
employment matters, as well as employee benefit, competition, anti-
money laundering, antitrust matters and health and wellness related
regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States.
Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations
and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do
business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related
interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be
predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies
and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may
require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to
implement, increase our operating costs and require significant
capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with
applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil
and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued
operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from
government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss
of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government
programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United
States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages
and/or penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which
we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure,
damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our
business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Walmart repeated and/or incorporated by reference substantially the
same risk factors in the Company’s 1Q 2018 10-Q, 2Q 2018 10-Q, 3Q 2018 10-Q,
2018 10-K, 1Q 2019 10-Q, 2Q 2019 10-Q, 3Q 2019 10-Q, and 2019 10-K.
The foregoing statements were false and materially misleading when
made and omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements not
misleading because the statements represented as hypothetical, risks that had
already transpired, namely that because of the Company’s decade long failure to
comply the CSA and related laws the Company was subject to a targeted DOJ
criminal investigation as well as a DOJ civil investigation.
F. McMillon’s and Biggs’s False and Misleading Sarbanes-Oxley
Certifications
Defendants McMillon and Biggs each signed certifications attached at
Exhibits to Walmart’s 2016 10-K, 2017 10-K, 2018 10-K and 2019 10-K as well as
each Class Period 10-Q pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley
Act (“SOX Certifications”).
McMillon’s and Biggs’ SOX 302 certifications state:
I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the
"registrant");
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report;
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed
under our supervision, to ensure that material information
relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared;
b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles;
c) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report our
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered
by this report, based on such evaluations; and
d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the Audit Committee of registrant's Board of
Directors:
a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information; and
b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role
in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting
McMillion’s and Biggs SOX 906 certification states:
The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and
The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all
material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the
Report.
McMillon’s and Biggs’s SOX certifications in each of Walmart’s Class
Period 10-K’s and 10-Q’s were false and misleading because: a) McMillon and
Biggs were aware of the fraud involving Walmart’s longstanding CSA violations
which subjected the Company to criminal and civil liability and reputational damage
and had not disclosed it to Walmart’s outside auditors; b) McMillon and Biggs were
aware that the financial statements did not fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition of the Company because the Company did not disclose a
material loss contingency related to the Government Investigations as ASC 450
required; (c) failed to disclose contemplated and pending material legal proceedings
related to Walmart’s illegal distribution and sale of opioids; and (d) the Class Period
10-K’s and 10-Q’s contained untrue facts/omitted material facts concerning the
risks and uncertainties the Company faced as a result of its CSA violations.
THE TRUTH BEGINS TO EMERGE
On March 25, 2020, before the market opened, the journalism outlet
ProPublica published an article disclosing for the first time that the Department of
Justice had been criminally investigating Walmart for violating the CSA and related
laws sales since 2016. The ProPublica article was based on hundreds of internal
Walmart documents and investigative documents, correspondence Walmart
exchanged with the DOJ, and nine people “familiar with the investigation.” The
article attached correspondence from Walmart’s top lawyer at Jones Day evidencing
that in March 2018 Defendants became aware that the DOJ intended to indict the
Company and remained the subject of an ongoing DOJ civil investigation. The
article also revealed that Walmart entered a secret settlement with the DEA in 2011
(the 2011 MOA) in which it agreed to implement measures to comply with the CSA,
and that Walmart had received more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA
from 2000 to 2018 for its opioid prescribing practices. The article further revealed
that Walmart did not comply with the 2011 MOA, prompting the DOJ to pursue
criminal charges against the Company.
On this news shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share from
its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020 to its close at $109.40 on March 25,
2020.
ProPublica’s expose shocked not only investors but members of
Congress. On April 2, 2020, Senator Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to Attorney
General William Barr questioning why high-ranking DOJ officials prevented
federal prosecutors from bringing criminal charges against Walmart. Senator
Feinstein’s letter states, in part:
This letter requests additional information regarding the Department of
Justice’s efforts to ensure that pharmacies are not helping fuel the
opioid epidemic by filling prescriptions under suspicious
circumstances.
**
In 2011, a DEA investigation found that a Walmart pharmacy in
California had repeatedly filled opioid prescriptions from unlicensed
doctors. In response, Walmart signed a Memorandum of Agreement
with the DEA in which it pledged to implement procedures to guard
against improper opioid dispensing. [ProPublica, March 25, 2019;
DEA-Walmart Memorandum of Agreement March 17, 2011]
New reporting indicates that despite this agreement, officials at
Walmart’s corporate headquarters refused to let the company’s
pharmacists block prescriptions from doctors believed to be operating
“pill mills,” including prescriptions that led to drug overdose deaths
of customers in Texas. Rather than empowering its pharmacists to
cut off prescriptions from problematic doctors, the company
reportedly decided that “driving sales and patient awareness is a far
better use of our Market Directors and Market manager’s
time.” [ProPublica, March 25, 2019]
After a two-year investigation, federal prosecutors in the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas informed Walmart
that they planned to indict the company for violating the Controlled
Substances Act. They were reportedly overruled, however, after
Walmart appealed to high-ranking Justice Department political
appointees. [ProPublica, March 25, 2019]
It is important to understand why the U.S. Attorney’s Office was
overruled in this case, particularly because the acting DEA director
supported bringing charges. Notably, it appears that the Justice
Department decided not to pursue charges despite the fact that it had
established a Prescription Interdiction & Litigation Task Force
designed to “use all criminal and civil tools at its disposal to hold
distributors such as pharmacies, pain management clinics, drug testing
facilities, and individual physicians accountable for unlawful actions.”
[DOJ Press Release, Feb. 27, 2018]
On December 22, 2020, while the market was open, the DOJ
announced in a press release that it had filed a lawsuit against Walmart for its
alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act and the Company’s role in the
opioid epidemic. The DOJ press release stated, in pertinent part:
In a civil complaint filed today, the Department of Justice has alleged
that Walmart Inc. unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from
pharmacies it operated across the country and unlawfully distributed
controlled substances to those pharmacies throughout the height of the
prescription opioid crisis.
The complaint alleges that this unlawful conduct resulted in hundreds
of thousands of violations of the Controlled Substances Act
(CSA). The Justice Department seeks civil penalties, which could
total in the billions of dollars, and injunctive relief.
“It has been a priority of this administration to hold accountable those
responsible for the prescription opioid crisis. As one of the largest
pharmacy chains and wholesale drug distributors in the country,
Walmart had the responsibility and the means to help prevent the
diversion of prescription opioids,” said Jeffrey Bossert Clark, Acting
Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. “Instead, for years,
it did the opposite — filling thousands of invalid prescriptions at its
pharmacies and failing to report suspicious orders of opioids and
other drugs placed by those pharmacies. This unlawful conduct
contributed to the epidemic of opioid abuse throughout the United
States. Today’s filing represents an important step in the effort to
hold Walmart accountable for such conduct.”
“We entrust distributors and dispensers with the responsibility to ensure
controlled substances do not fall into the wrong hands,” said Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) Acting Administrator Timothy
Shea. “When processes to safeguard against drug diversion are
violated or ignored, or when pharmacies routinely fill illegitimate
prescriptions, we will hold accountable anyone responsible, including
Walmart. Too many lives have been lost because of oversight failures
and those entrusted with responsibility turning a blind eye.”
The result of a multi-year investigation by the department’s
Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force, the complaint
filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleges that
Walmart violated the CSA in multiple ways as the operator of its
pharmacies and wholesale drug distribution centers. The complaint
alleges that, as the operator of its pharmacies, Walmart knowingly
filled thousands of controlled substance prescriptions that were not
issued for legitimate medical purposes or in the usual course of
medical practice, and that it filled prescriptions outside the ordinary
course of pharmacy practice. The complaint also alleges that, as the
operator of its distribution centers, which ceased distributing
controlled substances in 2018, Walmart received hundreds of
thousands of suspicious orders that it failed to report as required to
by the DEA. Together, the complaint alleges, these actions helped to
fuel the prescription opioid crisis.
If Walmart is found liable for violating the CSA, it could face civil
penalties of up to $67,627 for each unlawful prescription filled and
$15,691 for each suspicious order not reported. The court also may
award injunctive relief to prevent Walmart from committing further
CSA violations.
“For years, Walmart failed to meet its obligations in distributing and
dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,” said Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Daniel J. Feith of the Civil Division’s Consumer
Protection Branch. “We look forward to advancing this case with our
DOJ partners.”
“The opioid crisis has exacted a catastrophic human toll upon the
residents of our district and upon our country,” said U.S. Attorney for
the Middle District of Florida Maria Chapa Lopez. “National
pharmacy chains must meet their legal obligations when dispensing and
distributing these powerful medications. The filing of this complaint in
collaboration with the Department of Justice and other United States
Attorneys’ Offices demonstrates our firm commitment to enforcing
these critical legal requirements.”
“As a pharmacy that fills prescriptions for controlled substances,
Walmart has an obligation to fill only those prescriptions that are
legitimate,” said Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New
York Seth D. DuCharme. “As a wholesale drug distributor, Walmart
also had an obligation to notify DEA of suspicious orders of controlled
substances. Walmart failed to comply with both of its obligations, and
thereby failed in its responsibility to prevent the diversion of
controlled substances.”
“Today’s complaint is the culmination of a painstaking investigation
by my office and our Department of Justice colleagues that uncovered
years of unlawful conduct that did untold damage to communities
around the country, including here in Colorado,” said U.S. Attorney
for the District of Colorado Jason R. Dunn. “We look forward to
pursuing justice and holding the company accountable for its
conduct.”
(Emphasis added.)
The DOJ Complaint revealed to investors that despite the
Investigations, and despite Walmart’s awareness of its CSA violations, Walmart’s
non-compliance with the CSA continued until at least December 22, 2020. The
DOJ Complaint further revealed the breadth and scope of Walmart’s CSA violations
and the enormous liability it faced in connection with the suit.
On this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%,
over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020.
ADDITIONAL SCIENTER ALLEGATIONS
The facts set forth above, when viewed holistically and together with
the other allegations in this Complaint support a strong inference that each of the
Defendants knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that each of the
misrepresentations and omissions alleged herein were materially false and
misleading at the time they were made.
At all relevant times, each of the Defendants knew of the existence of
the Government Investigations. In addition, it is inconceivable that each of the
Defendants did not know of the 2011 MOA given that it was a settlement that was
national in scope and bound the entire company, was signed by Walmart senior
leadership and would have had to be approved by Walmart’s senior leadership.
Further, by at least June 2014, according to the June 2014 PSW, each of the
Defendants knew that Walmart lacked a nationwide suspicious order monitoring
program, as required by the CSA and 2011 MOA- which was an “existing risk,”
and that the “events or conditions underlying the Risk [i.e. the absence of a SOM
program] will occur,” leading to a “severe” risk of “financial or reputational impact
to the Company[,], which included “fraudulent activities” and “reputational risk.”
Accordingly, each of the Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the
Investigations were material to investors because they would invariably uncover
Walmart’s CSA violations. Each of the Defendants therefore knew or recklessly
disregarded that their statements and omissions concerning Walmart’s potential
material liabilities, material loss contingencies, opioid stewardship program and the
risks to Walmart’s pharmacy business were false and materially misleading to
investors at the time they were made. In addition to the facts discussed above, the
following facts further support a strong inference of the Defendants’ scienter.
A. The Complaint Pleads a Strong Inference of Scienter as to
Defendant McMillon
As the MDL Court found, Defendant McMillon has personal
knowledge of Walmart’s opioid policies and the Criminal Investigation into
Walmart. In October 2016 McMillon asked his friend, who had lost a son to opioids
what Walmart could to help his mission of combatting opioid abuse. McMillon
emphasized that he was serious and emailed Walmart executives his friend’s
suggestions. Defendant McMillon was therefore highly attuned to the opioid crisis
and was personally focused Walmart’s opioid compliance policies.
Defendant McMillon provided input into and was required to approve
the Company’s July 26, 2018 presentation to the DOJ in the face of Walmart’s
anticipated indictment, demonstrating his knowledge of and involvement in the
Criminal Investigation, as well as the gravity of the Investigation.
Defendant McMillon was a member of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance
and Risk Committee which oversees Walmart’s ethics and compliance matters and
makes recommendations about identifying, monitoring and mitigating compliance
risks. As a member of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee
Defendant McMillon would have received the documents from Walmart’s
compliance department referenced in the DOJ Complaint detailing Walmart’s CSA
violations.
In February 2018 Walmart hired Rachel Brand, who left the DOJ, as its
Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Brand reported directly to Defendant
McMillon. A July 29, 2018 e-mail produced in the Opioid MDL (infra ¶347) states
Rachel Brand was in charge of a project to make red-flag information accessible to
all pharmacists- something that Walmart should have done years prior in order to
comply with the CSA. Defendant McMillon would have been made aware of this-
had he not been already- through Brand.
Defendant McMillon also signed each of Walmart’s quarterly and
annual reports filed with the SEC during the Class Period and signed SOX
certifications attesting to the accuracy of the information, inter alia, in Walmart’s
quarterly and annual reports. Each misstatement in this case (with the exception of
one) was contained in an SEC filing signed by Defendant McMillon stating that it
did not contain any untrue statement of material fact. Given McMillon’s knowledge
of any easy access to information showing the falsity of the statements alleged
herein, McMillon was, at a minimum, reckless in signing them.
B. The Complaint Pleads a Strong Inference of Scienter as to
Defendant Biggs
Defendant Biggs was a member of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and
Risk Committee which oversees Walmart’s ethics and compliance matters and
makes recommendations about identifying, monitoring and mitigating compliance
risks. As a member of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee
Defendants Biggs would have received the documents from Walmart’s compliance
documents referenced in the DOJ Complaint detailing Walmart’s CSA violations.
As Walmart’s CFO, Defendant Biggs signed each Walmart 10-K and
10-Q and SOX certification during the Class Period. As CFO it was Defendant
Biggs’s job to review and assess the accuracy of the Company’s statements
concerning disclosure of material liabilities and loss contingencies because they
were part of Walmart’s financial statements. It is inconceivable that Defendant Biggs
was unaware of the Investigations. Defendant Biggs also received the June 2014
PSW, and any minimal level of due diligence would have uncovered Walmart’s CSA
violations and therefore the fact that the Investigations posed a material liability to
Walmart and were required to be disclosed to investors. Accordingly, Defendant
Biggs was, as minimum, reckless when he signed the filings containing the
misstatements and material omissions and the SOX certifications accompanying
them.
C. MDL Court’s Summary Judgment Opinion, the Jury Verdict, and
the Abatement Order Supports Scienter
On January 27, 2020 the MDL Court denied Walmart’s motion for
summary judgment stating that “the record evidence suggests obvious deficiencies
[in Walmart’s opioid suspicious order monitoring] that a layperson could plainly
recognize.” The MDL Court’s recognition of the obviousness of Walmart’s failure
to comply with the CSA’s requirement to have a functioning SOM program
supports an inference of scienter.
After a six-week trial, on November 23, 2021 the jury in the first
bellwether trial in the Opioid MDL found Walmart guilty of creating a public
nuisance in connection with the dispensing and distribution of opioids. Following
the guilty verdict Walmart engaged in failed attempts to have the jury verdict
overturned and/or have the case retried. After extensive briefing on F.R.C.P. 59
and 60 motions, the MDL Court concluded that: (1) the verdict was supported by
the weight of the evidence (2) defendants were not entitled to a new trial. The core
facts the Opioid MDL plaintiffs alleged and proved are the same core facts that
formed the basis for the Government’s case against Walmart, and dated all the way
back to the 2011 MOA.
In the Abatement Order the MDL Court held that because “the
evidence presented in the Phase I trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that
Defendants’ underlying dispensing conduct was both knowing and intentional.”
Walmart’s share of the penalty is $216,866,667. Further, the MDL Court
specifically found that Walmart’s wrongful conduct was ongoing, stating that “the
ongoing, unreasonable interference with public health in this case is complicated
and multi-faceted, and consists of both Defendants’ ongoing conduct and the
resulting nuisance-causing conditions. The MDL Court issued an injunction
requiring, among other things, Walmart to have a Chief Controlled Substance
Compliance Officer for a period of 15 years.
The egregiousness of Walmart’s CSA violations and the fact that they
went on for over a decade and are ongoing demonstrates that Defendants must have
been aware of them and, correspondingly, aware of the risks the Investigations
posed to the Company.
D. Walmart’s Efforts to Withhold Evidence and Improperly Interfere
with the Investigations Supports Scienter
Walmart’s attempt to withhold evidence concerning Defendants’
knowledge of the DOJ Investigation supports an inference of scienter. The MDL
Court sanctioned Walmart for failing to produce the PowerPoint slides Walmart
presented to the DOJ as well as documents related to alleged corporate
mismanagement. The MDL Court found that: “Walmart’s excuses for not timely
producing this discovery require convoluted or illogical understandings of the
Court’s clear and repeated messages to the parties. It is vexatious for Walmart to
reach and pretend to see exceptions where none exist, and then use these phantom
exceptions as a means to delay or avoid complying with clear Court Orders. The
MDL Court further noted Walmart’s repeated attempts to cabin discovery stating:
“Defendants’ obligation has been set forth with clear language for three years, and
the Court has rejected each attempt since by Defendants to suggest the obligation
should be constrained. That Walmart is willing to engage in sanctionable discovery
misconduct rather than produce relevant evidence pursuant to a clear court order
demonstrates its continued desire to conceal its illegal acts.
Walmart also withheld evidence from government prosecutors in
connection with the DOJ Investigation. As ProPublica reported, according to
prosecutors Walmart did not cooperate with the investigation. Notably, Walmart
refused to produce emails between the Company’s senior management and
compliance officials.
Walmart’s improper interference with the Investigations additionally
supports an inference of scienter. Walmart successfully delayed federal prosecutor’s
case against it by improperly appealing to high-level officials in the DOJ. Joshua
Russ resigned on October 25, 2019 in disgust and protest of Walmart’s improper
interference. Russ stated in his resignation letter that Walmart “abused the
Department’s fairness, largely ignored our subpoena, and scoffed at our larger work
on behalf of all Americans.”
The day Russ resigned he filed a confidential whistleblower complaint
with the DOJ’s inspector general alleging interference by the DOJ’s political
leaders, stating that they blocked prosecutors’ efforts to obtain key evidence and
provided special treatment to Walmart.
E. Walmart’s Inconsistent Representations Concerning the Status of
the DOJ’s Criminal Investigation Supports Scienter
According to Walmart’s own representations to at least one court, the
DOJ’s criminal investigation into Walmart remained opened through at least
October 2020. According to Walmart’s October 2020 representations to the Circuit
Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia in In re Opioid Litigation, Civil Action
No. 19-C-9000, the DOJ’s criminal investigation into Walmart continued even after
the declination. In an October 20, 2020 order compelling Walmart to produce
documents related to government investigations the West Virginia court chastised
Walmart for its inconsistent positions concerning the status of the DOJ’s criminal
investigation. The court stated: “Plaintiffs point out that although Walmart
represents to this Court that the DOJ’s criminal investigation into it is ongoing,
Walmart has represented to at least one court that the investigation finished without
an indictment issuing. Walmart’s inconsistent representations to this Court and
others concerning the status to the DOJ’s criminal investigation into it is concerning,
to say the least.”
F. Defendants’ Motive Supports Scienter
Opioids were a major driver of customer traffic to Walmart stores.
Walmart operated its pharmacies to draw customers in to buy other non-pharmacy
goods and specifically offered drastic discounts on opioids to drive customer traffic
to its stores. Walmart’s fiscal year 2017 annual report states that risks to its
pharmacy business could “result in the loss of cross-store or club selling
opportunities, and in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity.”
To attract pharmacy customers to its stores, Walmart collaborated with
McKesson to make trial offers, savings cards, and e-coupons to promote discount
opioids. Walmart also agreed to partner on direct mail campaigns to sell Butrans on
behalf of Purdue Pharma, using Walmart’s prescription data to reach prior buyers
of these products to encourage them to seek more prescriptions.
Walmart’s pharmacy incentive plan provided bonus payments to
pharmacists based on the number of prescriptions filled regardless of whether the
prescriptions were for controlled substances.
Defendants’ motive to drive sales by attracting customers to Walmart
who filled prescriptions for opioids and could do so without question supports an
inference of scienter. Indeed, the DOJ stated in its complaint that Walmart
intentionally failed to comply with the law in order to avoid the burden and expense
of compliance and also to drive customer traffic to it stores to increase sales of non-
pharmacy products. In short, the DOJ alleged “Walmart substantially benefitted]
itself while increasing the risk of undetected unlawful conduct and serious
widespread harm to Americans in the midst of a nationwide prescription drug
abuse epidemic.
G. Walmart’s Actions in Connection with its Membership in the
National Association of Chain Drug Stores Supports Scienter
The Opioid MDL Plaintiffs alleged that the “Distributor Defendants”
(consisting of companies that distributed opioids) were members of the Healthcare
Distribution Alliance (“HDA”) and that the “Pharmacy Defendants” (which
includes Walmart) the Distributor Defendants were members of the National
Association of Chain Drug Stores (“NACDS”).
The Opioid MDL Plaintiffs alleged that Walmart and other members
used the HDA and NACDS to protect the supply chain of opioids through various
means, including: (1) Drafting a “best practices” model for dealing with “suspicious
orders,” better known as the Industry Compliance Guidelines (“ICGs”), as a ruse to
avoid regulatory enforcement; (2) Coordinating to invalidate enforcement actions;
(3) Coordinating to fight the stricter controls for hydrocodone combination products
and (4) Circumventing the DEA through the creation of a coalition on controlled
substances that aimed to limit the scope of DEA restrictions on their continued
distribution of controlled substances.
In denying Walmart and the other MDL Defendants’ summary
judgment motions on plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy claims Judge Polster held that the
evidence showed that the Pharmacy Defendants: (i) used their membership and
leadership positions in NACDS and their relationship with Distributor Defendants
to “grow and protect the Opioid Supply Chain,” (ii) coordinated with Distributor
Defendants to form a “coalition” on controlled substances to limit the scope of DEA
regulations on the distribution of controlled substances, and (iii) worked “in
partnership” with the HDA to develop “solutions to the DEA enforcement issues”
and “strategies” concerning “ongoing problems that NACDS members are having
with DEA enforcement actions.”
H. Walmart’s Hiring of a Former Top-Ranking DOJ Official During
the Height of the DOJ Investigation Supports Scienter
On February 9, 2018 Walmart hired Rachel Brand at the Company’s
chief ethics and compliance officer (“CECO”). According to Walmart’s press
release announcing her appointment, Brand was “responsible for the organization’s
Legal [and] Global Ethics and Compliance and Global Investigation, Security.”
Brand reported directly to Defendant McMillon. Prior to joining Walmart Brand
was the third ranking top official at the DOJ. Brand resigned from the DOJ
specifically to take a job at Walmart. According to news reports, Brand’s departure
from the DOJ caught top DOJ members by surprise. Walmart’s hiring of a former
top ranking DOJ official during the pendency of the Government Investigations
DOJ’s criminal investigation demonstrates Defendants’ desire to influence the
investigation so that they could continue to conceal the Investigations from
investors and attempt to quash the Investigations through improper means.
Walmart’s hiring of Brand supports an inference of scienter.
LOSS CAUSATION/ECONOMIC LOSS
As a result of Defendants’ materially false or misleading statements,
Walmart’s stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class Period. Like other
members of the Class who purchased at artificially inflated prices during the Class
Period, Investors suffered an economic loss, i.e., damages, when the trading price
of Walmart’s common stock declined upon the disclosures that corrected
Defendants’ alleged false or misleading statements.
The damages suffered by Investors and other members of the Class
were a direct result of Defendants’ misrepresentations, which artificially inflated
the price of Walmart’s common stock, and the subsequent significant declines in
the value of Walmart’s stock once the truth regarding the Government
Investigations and Walmart’s CSA violations were revealed to the market in a series
to two partial corrective disclosures, correcting the misrepresentations and/or the
economic impact thereof.
On March 25, 2020 before the market opened, the investigative
journalism news source ProPublica published an article disclosing, for the first
time, material information previously unknown to the public, including:
-Walmart had received more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA
for its prescribing practices from 2000-2018;
-Walmart entered into a “secret settlement,” the 2011 MOA, with the DEA
in March 2011;
-Even during the time Walmart was under the 2011 MOA Walmart’s
compliance department tolerated Walmart’s CSA violations. For example,
Walmart’s internal emails demonstrated that Walmart internally tracked
certain doctors, yet Brad Nelson and other members of the compliance
department ignored these complaints and demanded that pharmacists and
employees focus on increasing sales rather than comply with the CSA;
-the DOJ in EDTX had intended to criminally indict Walmart, but Walmart
took steps to quash the indictment by improperly influencing DOJ officials
in Washington, D.C.;
-EDTX DOJ had been conducting a civil investigation of Walmart
concerning its potential CSA violations.
On this news shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share from
its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020 to its close at $109.40 on March 25,
2020, damaging investors.
On December 22, 2020, while the market was open, the DOJ
announced in a press release that it had filed a lawsuit against Walmart for alleged
violations of the Controlled Substances Act and the Company’s role in the opioid
epidemic. The DOJ Complaint revealed to investors that despite the Investigations,
and despite Walmart’s awareness of its CSA violations, Walmart’s non-compliance
with the CSA continued until at least December 22, 2020. The DOJ Complaint
further revealed the breadth and scope of Walmart’s CSA violations and the
enormous liability it faced in connection with the suit.
On this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%,
over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020,
damaging investors.
As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the
precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares, Investors
and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.
APPLICABILITY OF PRESUMPTION OF RELIANCE:
Fraud-on-the-Market Doctrine
Investors are entitled to rely, and will rely, upon the presumption of
reliance established by the fraud-on-the-market doctrine in that:
a. Defendants made public misrepresentations or failed to disclose
material facts during the Class Period;
b. the omissions and misrepresentations were material;
c. Walmart common stock is traded in an efficient market;
d. the misrepresentations and omissions alleged would tend to induce a
reasonable investor to misjudge the value of Walmart common stock;
and
e. Investors and members of the Class purchased, acquired and/or sold
Walmart common stock between the time the Defendants failed to
disclose or misrepresented material facts and the time the true facts
were disclosed, without knowledge of the omitted or misrepresented
facts.
At all relevant times, the market for Walmart common stock was an
efficient market for the following reasons, among others:
(a) Walmart’s common stock 500.com’s met the requirements for listing,
and were listed and actively traded on the NYSE, a highly efficient and
automated market;
(b) According to the Company’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Company had more
than 2.8 billion shares of common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2020,
demonstrating a very active and broad market for Walmart common stock;
(c) As a regulated issuer, Walmart filed periodic reports with the SEC;
(d) Walmart regularly communicated with public investors via
established communication mechanisms, including the regular
dissemination of press releases on national circuits of major newswire
services, the Internet, and other wide-ranging public disclosures;
(e) During the Class Period at least 25 stock market analysts followed
Walmart and wrote hundreds of reports on Walmart during the Class
Period. Analysts covering Walmart included Citigroup, Deutsche Bank,
Morgan Stanley and RBC.
(f) Unexpected material news about Walmart was rapidly reflected and
incorporated into the Company’s common stock price during the Class
Period. For example, when ProPublica published its expose revealing the DOJ
Investigation, Walmart’s common stock price fell a material amount.
As a result of the foregoing, the market for Walmart promptly digested
current information regarding Walmart from all publicly available sources and
reflected such information in Walmart’s common stock price. Under these
circumstances, all purchasers of Walmart common stock during the Class Period
suffered similar injury through their purchase of Walmart common stock at
artificially inflated prices, and a presumption of reliance applies
Affiliated Ute
Neither Investors nor the Class need prove reliance – either
individually or as a class because under the circumstances of this case, positive
proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery, pursuant to ruling of the United
States Supreme Court in Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S.
128 (1972). All that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense
that a reasonable investor might have considered the omitted information important
in deciding whether to buy or sell the subject security.
INVESTORS’ CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS
Investors bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) on behalf of a Class, consisting of all persons
who purchased Walmart common stock during the Class Period and who were
damaged thereby. Excluded from the Class are Defendants, the officers and
directors of the Company at all relevant times, members of their immediate families
and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns and any entity in which
defendants have or had a controlling interest.
The members of the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members
is impracticable. Throughout the Class Period, Walmart common stock was actively
traded on the NYSE. While the exact number of Class members is unknown to
Investors at this time and can only be ascertained through appropriate discovery,
Investors believe that there are at least thousands of members in the proposed Class.
Members of the Class may be identified from records maintained by Walmart or its
transfer agent and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail, using a
form of notice customarily used in securities class actions.
Investors’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class,
as all members of the Class are similarly affected by Defendants’ wrongful conduct
in violation of federal law that is complained of herein.
Investors will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
members of the Class and have retained counsel competent and experienced in class
and securities litigation.
Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class
and predominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the
Class. Among the questions of law and fact common to the Class are:
(a) whether the federal securities laws were violated by Defendants’
acts as alleged herein;
(b) whether statements made by Defendants to the investing public
during the Class Period misrepresented material facts about the
business, operations and management of Walmart;
(c) whether the Individual Defendants caused Walmart to issue false
and misleading statements during the Class Period;
(d) to what extent the members of the Class have sustained damages
and the proper measure of damages.
A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is
impracticable. Furthermore, as the damages suffered by individual Class members
may be relatively small, the expense and burden of individual litigation make it
impossible for members of the Class to redress individually the wrongs done to
them. There will be no difficulty in the management of this action as a class action.
NO SAFE HARBOR
The false and misleading statements alleged herein were not forward-
looking. To the extent any of the alleged false and misleading statements were
forward-looking, the federal statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements
under certain circumstances does not apply. Many of the specific statements alleged
were not identified as “forward-looking statements” when made. To the extent there
were any forward-looking statements, there were no meaningful cautionary
statements accompanying them. To be meaningful, cautionary statements must
identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those in the purportedly forward-looking statements. Such cautions were absent
from Walmart’s Class Period filings and oral disclaimers.
Alternatively, to the extent that the statutory safe harbor could apply to
any forward-looking statements pleaded herein, Defendants are liable for those false
and misleading forward-looking statements because, at the time each of those
forward-looking statements were made, the speaker knew that the particular
forward-looking statement was false or misleading and the forward-looking
statement was authorized and approved by an executive officer of Walmart who
knew that those statements were false or misleading when made. Moreover, to the
extent that Defendants issued any disclosures designed to warn or caution investors
of certain risks, those disclosures were also false and misleading.
COUNT I
Violations of Section 10(b) And Rule 10b-5
Promulgated Thereunder Against All Defendants
Investors repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained
above as if fully set forth herein.
This Count is asserted against Defendants is based upon Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
by the SEC.
During the Class Period, Defendants, individually and in concert,
directly or indirectly, disseminated or approved the false statements specified
above, which they knew or deliberately disregarded were misleading in that they
contained misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts necessary in order
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.
Defendants violated §10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 in that
they:
 employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud;
 made untrue statements of material facts or omitted to state
material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; or
 engaged in acts, practices and a course of business that operated
as a fraud or deceit upon plaintiff and others similarly situated in
connection with their purchases of Walmart securities during the
Class Period.
Defendants acted with scienter in that they knew that the public
documents and statements issued or disseminated in the name of Walmart were
materially false and misleading; knew that such statements or documents would be
issued or disseminated to the investing public; and knowingly and substantially
participated, or acquiesced in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or
documents as primary violations of the securities laws. These defendants by virtue
of their receipt of information reflecting the true facts of Walmart, their control over,
and/or receipt and/or modification of Walmart’s allegedly materially misleading
statements, and/or their associations with the Company which made them privy to
confidential proprietary information concerning Walmart, participated in the
fraudulent scheme alleged herein.
Individual Defendants, who are the senior officers and/or directors of
the Company, had actual knowledge of the material omissions and/or the falsity of
the material statements set forth above, and intended to deceive Plaintiff and the
other members of the Class, or, in the alternative, acted with reckless disregard for
the truth when they failed to ascertain and disclose the true facts in the statements
made by them or other Walmart personnel to members of the investing public,
including Investors and the Class.
As a result of the foregoing, the market price of Walmart securities was
artificially inflated during the Class Period. In ignorance of the falsity of
Defendants’ statements, Plaintiff and the other members of the Class relied on the
statements described above and/or the integrity of the market price of Walmart
securities during the Class Period in purchasing Walmart securities at prices that
were artificially inflated as a result of Defendants’ false and misleading statements.
Had Plaintiff and the other members of the Class been aware that the
market price of Walmart securities had been artificially and falsely inflated by
Defendants’ misleading statements and by the material adverse information which
Defendants did not disclose, they would not have purchased Walmart securities at
the artificially inflated prices that they did, or at all.
As a result of the wrongful conduct alleged herein, Plaintiff and other
members of the Class have suffered damages in an amount to be established at trial.
By reason of the foregoing, Defendants have violated Section 10(b) of
the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and are liable to the plaintiff
and the other members of the Class for substantial damages which they suffered in
connection with their purchase of Walmart securities during the Class Period.
COUNT II
Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
Against the Individual Defendants
Investors repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in
the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
During the Class Period, the Individual Defendants participated in the
operation and management of Walmart, and conducted and participated, directly
and indirectly, in the conduct of Walmart’s business affairs. Because of their senior
positions, they knew the adverse non-public information about Walmart’s
misstatement of revenue and profit and false financial statements.
As officers and/or directors of a publicly owned company, the
Individual Defendants had a duty to disseminate accurate and truthful information
with respect to Walmart’s financial condition and results of operations, and to
correct promptly any public statements issued by Walmart which had become
materially false or misleading.
Because of their positions of control and authority as senior officers,
