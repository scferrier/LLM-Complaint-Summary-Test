Vogel, Mark Alan Bentley, Peter Shane Donahue, Agata Agnieszka Powers, Avya Lindsey
Waiton, Timothy Michael Morgan, Tarsis Carvalho Humphreys, Zachary Michael Sellers, and
Brandon Michael Harrold (collectively “Plaintiffs”), by and through their undersigned
attorneys, commence this action against FxWinning Limited (“FxWinning”), CFT Solutions,
LLC (“CFT,” and together with FxWinning, the “Companies”), Renan de Rocha Gomes
Bastos, Rafael Brito Cutie, Arthur Percy, Roman Cardenas, and David Merino (individually
together the “Individual Defendants,” and together with the Companies the “Defendants”), and
allege as follows1:
INTRODUCTION
This action arises from Defendants’ numerous fraudulent actions and
misrepresentations regarding the Companies’ foreign exchange (forex) trading platform and
services, for which the Companies and Individual Defendants have converted tens of millions
of dollars belonging to Plaintiffs for Defendants’ benefit.
Defendants represented to Plaintiffs that Defendant Merino had invented an
algorithm that would allow clients such as Plaintiffs to receive high returns on forex trading,
which would be collectively run by CFT and its broker, FxWinning. Defendants pitched the
Companies as providing not just high returns, however, but they also guaranteed the security
of Plaintiffs’ funds – investments which would, in the end, total tens of millions of dollars.
But Defendants’ representations turned out to be false. While Defendants
initially permitted several withdrawals by Plaintiffs from their accounts through December
2022 – to lull Plaintiffs into a false sense of security and convince Plaintiffs to deposit
1 Plaintiffs Hind, Waiton, Stoeppelwerth, Jenkins, Malcolm, Salmeron, Floyd, Vogel, Bentley,
Donahue, Powers, Waiton, Morgan, Tarsis, Sellers, and Harrold have agreed to arbitrate their
claims against Defendants CFT, de Rocha, and Percy in Counts I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX,
X, and XI pursuant to the limited powers of attorney agreements they signed. They remain
plaintiffs here against Defendants FxWinning, Brito, Cardenas, and Merino.

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
additional funds – Defendants discontinued all withdrawals in early 2023 under the guise of
instituting new security-guided procedures to comply with requirements of its liquidity
provider, i.e., new Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
procedures.
Defendants’ purported justifications were farcical – and indeed fraudulent –
because, even after purportedly establishing the KYC and AML procedures and expressly
informing Plaintiffs in May and June 2023 that their KYC and AML updates were
“successfully completed” and that Plaintiffs would have their funds within fifteen working
days, Defendants have still failed to release a single dollar.
To this day, Defendants have wrongfully held – and continue to withhold – more
than $27,000,000.00 belonging to Plaintiffs.
For these and the following reasons, Plaintiffs bring this action to recover their
wrongfully withheld funds and seek damages against Defendants as a result of Defendants’
fraudulent and improper actions.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1331 because the case arises, in part, under Sections 5 and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of
1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e and 771(a)(1), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
This Court alternatively has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because
it arises, in part, under Sections 6 and 25 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b, 6e,
6o, and 25.
This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 because such claims are so closely related to the Securities claims
and/or Commodity Exchange Act claims that they are part of the same case and controversy.
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 7 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Personal jurisdiction exists over Defendants because this dispute arises out of,
or is related to, the Defendants’ contacts with this forum, including but not limited to operating
the Companies from Miami-Dade County, Florida (as both CFT Solutions and FxWinning have
their principal or other places of business in the state) and directing their operations to citizens
in Florida (among numerous U.S. citizens in several states). Indeed, FxWinning’s partner CFT
stated in its own lawsuit against FxWinning that FxWinning “operates, conducted, engaged in,
or carried on a business venture in Florida and breached the contract at issue in this action in
Florida by failing to perform acts required by the contract to be performed in Florida.”2
Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the acts
that form the basis of this action occurred in this district, the Companies operate out of Miami-
Dade County, Florida, and the Companies sold the investment accounts in their platform out
of Florida.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
Upon information and belief, CFT was established in 2019 by de Rocha. Upon
further information and belief, de Rocha hired Percy to be CFT’s COO.
CFT purports to offer investors a “High-Frequency Trading System” that
“use[s] . . . high-power computers . . . to execute a large number of orders at extremely high
speeds, detecting emerging trends in a fraction of a second,” that accordingly allows “traders
[to] make profits even with very small price fluctuations.”3
2 CFT’s lawsuit is captioned CFT Solutions, LLC et al. v. FxWinning LTD, and was filed on
May 5, 2023 as local case no. 2023-016392-CA-01 in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial
Circuit of Florida. In separate filings in that lawsuit, CFT has similarly described FxWinning
as operating a “fraudulent enterprise.” See Docket No. 48 for CFT’s Ex Parte Motion for
Alternative Service on Roman Cardenas.

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
CFT’s software allegedly conducts trades on the foreign exchange (forex)
market.
According to CFT, investors gain access to its software only by opening an
account with FxWinning (and in pari passu, that through the FxWinning brokerage account,
the investor can access CFT’s “High-Frequency Trading System”).
Upon information and belief, FxWinning was established in early 2020 by Brito
Cutie and Merino. Upon information and belief, Brito Cutie and Merino hired Cardenas to be
FxWinning’s vice president of operations in the United States.
FxWinning operates at least two websites, fxwinning.net and fxwinning.pro,
which are online platforms where customers can access their CFT/FxWinning accounts.
According to its website, FxWinning is a “brokerage firm” offering a “powerful
[ ] trading platform” “exclusive . . . to retail and institutional clients around the world” that
“guarantee[s] you the best spreads and trading conditions.”4 FxWinning’s description of its
platform and services mirrors CFT’s description of its own software. Upon information and
belief, the Companies’ platforms are one-and-the-same, if any such platform or software ever
existed.
FxWinning represents that it “has purchased Client Money Insurance (CMI) on
behalf of our clients and is a member of a network of responsible global financial service
providers offering additional layers of security.”5
Moreover, FxWinning represents that its platform is “transparen[t]” and that
FxWinning segregates all client funds from its separate company accounts.6

FxWinning represented on its FxWinning.net7 website that its servers were
located in New York and London, respectively, to facilitate fast transactions:
Upon information and belief, FxWinning.net continues to represent that its
servers are based in New York and London.
Collectively, CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, and Brito Cutie touted the
Companies’ services and platform to Plaintiffs to induce Plaintiffs to invest millions of dollars
with the Companies.
To that end, CFT created a Telegram channel on July 19, 2021 to “send
information about our HFT [High-Frequency Trading] system and some pertinent information
about the Forex world and the world economy.” The Telegram channel was directed
specifically to U.S. based investors, among others. Included here is a true and correct copy of
a screenshot of CFT’s Telegram channel dated July 19, 2021:

In December 2021, CFT posted that it would hold a “Mastermind” event in
Miami, Florida from January 21-23, 2022, for investors to meet the Companies’ Masterminds.
CFT stated that FxWinning “will also be present so that clients can meet executives from
fxwinning which is the broker we use and offers all the support so that we can run our software
at high performance.” Included here is a true and correct copy of a screenshot of CFT’s

FxWinning’s executives met U.S. based clients at the Miami, Florida
“Masterminds” event and upon information and belief knew and were informed, to the extent
FxWinning did not previously know, that its clients were based in the U.S. (in Florida, among
other states).
CFT continuously touted its link with its broker—FxWinning—which it
claimed was “regulated under one of the most difficult to obtain Forex regulations in the world”
(without specifying which regulations FxWinning was regulated under). Included here is a
true and correct copy of a screenshot of CFT’s Telegram channel dated March 28, 2022 (with
highlights added):

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
CFT stated in March 2022 that funds were transferred directly to the
Companies’ liquidity provider.
On April 10, 2022, CFT stated that it was “+44% positive this year 2022,”
compared to all other markets, which CFT contended “are all in the negative.” CFT told
Plaintiffs through its Telegram channel that “2022 is going to be an amazing year.”
And on May 24, 2022, CFT represented to Plaintiffs that the Companies were
“ending the month with an AMAZING result” and that even in a recession “Our software will
always perform better in situations of chaos and extreme volatility.” In so doing, CFT
acknowledged that it was its purported “software” that provided profits to investors, not any
independent action by the investors.
Defendants also represented higher returns were available to investors that
invested (either individually or as a pool) $4 million or more.
In addition to its Telegram channel, de Rocha hosted monthly Zoom sessions
exclaiming the benefits to investing with CFT and FxWinning, stating (through his translator
Renaud Adorno) that de Rocha had “zero” issues with FxWinning and trusted it over any other

potential broker. Plaintiffs viewed de Rocha’s Zoom sessions both before and after investing
with CFT and FxWinning.
As a result of Defendants’ representations, which were made in person by the
Companies’ executives, and includes the representations on their websites, on CFT’s Telegram
channel, and via de Rocha’s Zoom sessions, each of the Plaintiffs opened accounts with the
Companies and began depositing funds into their trading accounts:
a. Kristoffer Jon Hind opened his account (account number ending in *220) on or
about August 1, 2022.
b. Jason Thomas Waiton opened his account (account number ending in *982) on
or about September 1, 2022.

on or about September 12, 2022.
t. Brandon Michael Harrold opened his account (account number ending in *270)
on or about May 19, 2022.
Each of the Plaintiffs also signed limited power-of-attorney agreements with
CFT for CFT to effectuate trading on the FxWinning accounts. In exchange for its services,
CFT charged Plaintiffs either a 40% or 50% account management fee.
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 17 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Relevant here, Plaintiffs Campbell, Longmire, Phillips, and Yates signed an
approximately five-page limited power of attorney. The limited power of attorney provided
that CFT would “manage [the customer’s] trading account with a 50% account management
fee.” Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of Plaintiff Campbell’s limited
power of attorney.
Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs’ funds were pooled together to
effectuate CFT’s and FxWinning’s operation of its software.
Importantly, CFT maintained complete control over its software and the alleged
trading it and FxWinning conducted using its and FxWinning’s software. Plaintiffs did not
possess any control over any alleged trades on the Companies’ platform and instead were only
able to see their purported account balances.
Plaintiffs were not permitted to create an account and “start trading” until they
certified that they agreed to FxWinning’s terms and conditions, available on both the
fxwinning.net and fxwinning.pro websites.
Section 3.4 of the terms and conditions provides that at “all times” Plaintiffs
“have the right to withdraw [the amount owed as the balance of the account]”:
3.4 After the activation of the account, the Client will be able to see the
amount owed as the balance of the account in MyFxWinning (the
Company’s online portal) at all times and will have the right to withdraw
the same, upon request.
The terms and conditions provided no restrictions on Plaintiffs’ ability to
withdraw their funds.
But for Defendants’ representations (in person, through its agents and
representatives, online on FxWinning’s website, and on CFT’s Telegram channel and through
de Rocha’s Zoom sessions), including Defendants’ guarantees of security of Plaintiffs’ funds
and the promise of the “best spreads” available, Plaintiffs would not have opened their
accounts.

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Even after Plaintiffs opened their accounts, Defendants pushed Plaintiffs to
continuously deposit more and more money into their accounts—all of which greatly benefited
CFT as it earned a 40% or 50% fee based on a percentage of the funds in the accounts.
Upon information and belief, Percy benefited through Plaintiffs’ investments
and received at least $141,625.48 in commissions.
Defendants also invited Plaintiffs to a yacht party in January 2022, with de
Rocha (CFT’s CEO) and Cardenas (FxWinning’s VP) both in attendance, and discussed further
investment in the Companies and the returns that the Companies were earning.
Plaintiffs Longmire and Phillips personally attended the yacht party and relied
on de Rocha’s and Cardenas’ representations regarding the Companies’ returns to increase their
investments. Upon information and belief, de Rocha and Cardenas knew that Plaintiffs
Longmire and Phillips were U.S. residents.
Defendants also held conferences and invited Plaintiffs (among other potential
investors) as their guests to a “summit” in the Bahamas in December 2022 during which CFT
and FxWinning (through their executives, including but not limited to de Rocha) celebrated the
high returns that Plaintiffs were purportedly earning and pushed Plaintiffs to increase their
investments.
Plaintiff Campbell personally attended the Bahamas summit and heard and
relied on Defendants’ representations, including those by de Rocha. Upon information and
belief, Defendants knew that its visiting investors were U.S. residents and had traveled to the
Bahamas from the U.S.
To promote the platform and services during the summit to, among others, U.S.
investors, Defendants introduced attorneys general Matthew Whitaker (former acting United
States Attorney General) and Todd Rokita (Indiana Attorney General) as CFT’s latest board
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 19 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
members and paid them to speak regarding Defendants’ (particularly de Rocha’s)
professionalism and business judgment.
Indeed, Defendants went to great lengths to hold the Companies out as
legitimate, both in the United States and abroad, through the Companies’ websites, and at the
Companies’ events Defendants made numerous representations to encourage U.S. customers
to invest with Defendants.
To further convince investors of the security of its and FxWinning’s software,
CFT presented a purported KPMG audit report stating that all trades had been reviewed. Upon
information and belief, the representation regarding a KPMG audit report was false because
the audit report was fake.
Defendants also provided Plaintiffs what was purported to be the CFT
dashboard showing the success of the Companies’ forex trading:
Upon information and belief, CFT’s dashboard representation was false because the
Companies did not earn such high returns and/or did not make any trades at all.
CFT stated that the Companies’ trading was 71% successful and “one of the
best software in the world.” Upon information and belief, CFT’s (and FxWinning’s) success
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 20 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
rate was false because the Companies did not earn such high returns and/or did not make any
trades at all.
Around the same time as the Summit, CFT posted on its Telegram channel on
December 16, 2022, that the Companies would soon stop accepting new clients and thus
promote a limited supply, to increase demand on the accounts. CFT stated there were only
“2,000 vacancies left”: “You will see that when people start to see that they will no longer be
able to use our software, they will start to value it much more and will be desperate for a spot.
Congratulations to those who are taking advantage of this technology that God has given us
and are getting rich using this wonder called compound interest. 2023 the world will know
about our software but it will be too late for many.”
Following the December Bahamas summit, however, and beginning in or
around January 2023, Defendants began informing Plaintiffs that their withdrawals would be
delayed. Whereas withdrawals initially took 24-48 hours, Defendants represented that due to
the holidays and for other reasons, withdrawals would take several days to process.
By the middle of January, Defendants informed Plaintiffs that any requested
withdrawals would take up to two weeks.
Defendants continued to nevertheless request that Plaintiffs deposit additional
funds – despite disallowing any withdrawals. For example, de Rocha stated on CFT’s telegram
channel on February 3, 2023, that the Companies would soon close out new investments and
that “if interested, get in now.” CFT represented that “nobody new will be able to use the
software, only if one of you wants to give your software license to someone else.” CFT
accordingly represented that its “software license”—which CFT claimed entitled the individual
to its high returns—was transferrable.
By the end of February 2023, Defendants told Plaintiffs that no withdrawals
would be made. Defendants blamed the inability to process any withdrawals on new

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
KYC/AML requirements that FxWinning’s liquidity provider had purportedly instituted.
Defendants did not provide a timeline when the KYC/AML process would be complete.
CFT sold the KYC process as a positive and represented an increase in
regulatory oversight and would also increase profits: “After all the Kyc process and regulation
that the brokerage is now doing with the bodies, it will be easier because we will have access
to Asian and other liquidity providers that the brokerage did not have before.” CFT further
stated that things would “get A LOT better in the coming months” and for everyone to “Just
wait and watch.” Included here is a true and correct copy of CFT’s Telegram channel dated
February 19, 2023 (with highlights added):
By or around late March and early April 2023, Plaintiffs had submitted all
requested information to comply with Defendants’ purported updated KYC/AML procedures.
The information that Plaintiffs submitted to CFT and FxWinning included
documentation further showing the Plaintiffs’ U.S. residencies.
In April 2023, FxWinning advised Plaintiffs that the time to process
withdrawals would depend on the KYC/AML process.
On April 16, 2023, FxWinning posted the following on its website:
The KYC process continues to evolve, and many clients have already been
approved through emails. For those who were approved and had pending
withdrawals, we are happy to inform you that the withdrawals have been
processed and your accounts are properly normalized. . . .
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 22 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Our goal is to normalize all withdrawals as soon as possible, ensuring
security and compliance with applicable regulations. We value your trust
in our platform and strive to offer the highest level of service and
professionalism.
By or around late May and early June 2023, FxWinning informed Plaintiffs by
email that their applications/updated information were “successfully completed” and that
FxWinning would process Plaintiffs’ withdrawals within “15 working days”:
Dear customer,
We are pleased to inform that your KC and AML process has been
successfully completed. Your account is now able to withdraw normally.
This process was necessary due to instruction from our liquidity provider to
implement advanced KYC and AML procedures to all existing clients. This
ensures compliance with legal and regulatory standards to prevent money
laundering, thus guaranteeing the security and stability of our platform.
Remember that in case you have any pending withdrawal you will be able
to have this money in your wallet in 15 working days, once it is processed
we will send you the confirmation via email.
Despite representing by June 2023 that Plaintiffs’ withdrawals would be
processed within fifteen days, Defendants have yet to release any of Plaintiffs’ funds.
On June 12, 2023, FxWinning posted to its website that “We expect withdrawal
payments to become effective immediately, having received the green light to start this
process.”
On June 17, 2023, Plaintiff Campbell messaged Brito Cutie stating that he had
“put in a withdrawal request on Monday and haven’t gotten the confirmation email. No
response from support either.” Brito Cutie informed Campbell on June 20, 2023, that
FxWinning would have to close the company, but nevertheless reassured Campbell that the
“client portal will remain, so everyone can see all,” withdrawals would happen soon, and
“Nothing [is] lost as people believe.”
Despite FxWinning’s and Brito Cutie’s representations that the withdrawals
would be forthcoming, FxWinning posted the following on its website on June 20, 2023:

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Important Notice: FxWinning Limited regrets to inform you that due to
unforeseen circumstances, our services will cease on Thursday,
22.06.2023. Please close all open trades before Wednesday 21.06.2023
13:00 GMT+3 to avoid possible problems. Kindly withdraw your
remaining funds promptly, and our team will assist you in the process.
Withdrawals will be available until Friday 30.06.2023. We apologize for
any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding during this
challenging time. (Emphasis in original.)
FxWinning has, to date, failed to release any of Plaintiffs’ funds or process their
withdrawals, despite numerous requests to do so, and any “normalizing” or “approval” that
FxWinning and Brito Cutie stated would occur did not result in any withdrawals being
processed.
Contrary to FxWinning’s representations that it would segregate accounts and
provide the “highest standards of security and trust for clients funds,” none of FxWinning
representations (or CFT’s representations about FxWinning) were true when made.
Upon information and belief, whereas Defendants prevented any withdrawals
by Plaintiffs, Defendants (including de Rocha, Percy, Cardenas, Merino, and Brito Cutie)
withdrew millions of dollars for their own personal benefit.
Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants received substantial
commissions and profits (totaling millions of dollars) from each Plaintiff that signed up and
invested with the Companies (commissions and profits which were, upon information and
belief, based on the amount of money that Plaintiffs invested).
At present, the total value of Plaintiffs’ accounts is approximately
$27,311,827.00 :
a. Kristoffer Jon Hind has an account value of at least $444,367.59.
b. Jason Thomas Waiton has an account value of at least $701,392.67.
c. Christopher Campbell has account values of at least $10,847,597.00.
d. Paul Douglas Stoeppelwerth has an account value of at least $448,783.71.
e. Lucas Longmire has an account value of at least $9,359,107.30.

Upon information and belief, the Defendants have known (or should have
known) since the beginning of the creation of the Companies that the Companies were nothing
more than a fraudulent scheme to induce potential transfers of money to CFT and FxWinning,
no high rate of return would be possible, and that Plaintiffs would never receive a full
withdrawal from their accounts as they were promised. Most egregiously:
a. CFT represented that FxWinning was regulated under one of the most difficult
to obtain Forex regulations in the world. This statement was either knowingly
false or should have been known to have been false because, upon information
and belief, FxWinning was not regulated under one of the most difficult to
obtain Forex regulations in the world. This fact was also easily verifiable
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 25 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
through due diligence by CFT and its executives as account managers to the
investors and as partners to FxWinning.
b. CFT represented that it had conducted and been provided a KPMG audit report
stating that all trades had been reviewed. This statement was either knowingly
false or should have been known to have been false because, upon information
and belief, the audit report was fake and/or no trades had occurred. This fact
was also easily verifiable through due diligence by CFT and its executives as
account managers to the investors and as partners to FxWinning.
c. FxWinning represented that it had purchased Client Money Insurance (CMI) on
behalf of its clients and was a member of a network of responsible global
financial service providers offering additional layers of security. This statement
was either knowingly false or should have been known to have been false
because, upon information and belief, FxWinning did not purchase CMI, nor
was FxWinning a member of a network of responsible global financial service
providers offering additional layers of security. This fact was also easily
verifiable to CFT through due diligence by CFT and its executives as account
managers to the investors and as partners to FxWinning.
d. CFT created a dashboard purporting to show the exponential increase in the
value of each investors’ account. CFT’s dashboard representation was
knowingly false or should have been known to have been false because the
Companies did not earn such high returns and/or did not make any trades at all.
This fact was also easily verifiable to CFT through due diligence by CFT and
its executives as account managers to the investors and as partners to
FxWinning.

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Upon information and belief, Individual Defendants used their ill-gotten gains
to purchase real property and cryptocurrency.
Upon information and belief, de Rocha, through his shell entity BBRC,
purchased real property at 2608 Biarritz Drive in Miami Beach, Florida in or about September
2022 using his ill-gotten gains.
Upon information and belief, Merino purchased real property at 725 NE 24th St
in Miami, Florida in or about November 2022 for $4.7 million using his ill-gotten gains.
Merino’s assistant has confirmed that Merino knew FxWinning was fraudulent and used ill-
gotten gains for his personal benefit.8
Upon information and belief, Defendants have also withdrawn millions from
CFT and/or FxWinning accounts and/or cryptocurrency wallets belonging to CFT and/or
FxWinning, despite no other investor withdrawals being permitted.
Defendants’ actions have led to worldwide press beyond numerous lawsuits
already filed in the United States. For example, an article on Portal do Bitcoin is titled: “FX
Winning: Brazilian company is suspected of joining an international pyramid and leaving
investors with millionaire losses.” The article notes that “Through his company CFT Solutions,
Renan [de Rocha Gomes] Bastos was the main money raiser in Brazil for a global scheme that
has not paid customers since February.” A true and correct copy of the article, translated in
English using Google Translate, is available at: https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/fx-winning-
empresa-brasileira-e-acusada-de-integrar-piramide-internacional-e-deixar-investidores-com-
prejuizo-milionario/. The article notes that FxWinning was being investigated by the Mexican
government as a “possible financial pyramid” scheme and that regulators in Spain, France, and
other countries as well “are seeing more and more evidence of fraud in the FX Winning scheme,
8 See Exhibit C to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Ex Parte Temporary Injunction in Robles et al. v.
FXWinning LTD. et al., Case No. 2023-026279-CA-01, filed in the Circuit Court of the

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
and that this strengthens suspicions that the blocking of withdrawals was the result of the
collapse of a financial pyramid.” The article further notes that investors were deceived “by
Renan’s company” (i.e., CFT) because he claimed his “trading robot” only worked on FX
Winning and which supposedly generated average profits of 9% per month. The investors were
“told that this profit came automatically from the high-frequency algorithm supposedly
developed by CFT and integrated into FX Winning. All the customer needed to do was
deposit cryptocurrencies with the broker and wait for the magic to happen.” (Emphasis
added.) As the article states regarding the coordination between CFT and FxWinning, “The
entire CFT Solutions scheme only worked at FX Winning, presented by Renan as the fastest
broker on the market.” Finally, the article notes de Rocha’s prior promotions of “Cash Time
1” and “Wish Money,” separate possible financial pyramid schemes that similarly prevented
customers from withdrawing their money and establishing a pattern of conduct by de Rocha.
A separate article regarding Wish Money noted that its leaders, including de
Rocha, knew that Wish Money was a fraudulent pyramid scheme and that de Rocha stated he
could simply “clos[e] the company arbitrarily without talking to anyone,” which is “very easy.”
A true and correct copy of the article, translated in English using Google Translate, is available
at: https://br.cointelegraph.com/news/audio-reveals-wish-money-knew-about-financial-
pyramid-scheme.
A third article, from Brazil, further notes that CFT, de Rocha, and FxWinning
defrauded customers “from all over Brazil, Poland and the United States.” The article similarly
notes that de Rocha, “formerly of Wish Money, also participated in the possible FXWinning
fraud by trapping clients for the company.” A true and correct copy of the article, translated in

COUNT I
(Violation of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. § 77e and 77l(a)(1) – against
Defendants CFT and FxWinning)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
Section 5(a) of the Securities Act states: “Unless a registration statement is in
effect as to a security, it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly (1) to make use
of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of
the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise; or
(2) to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means
or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after
sale.” 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a).
Section 5(c) of the Securities Act states: “It shall be unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or
communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through
the use or medium of any prospectus of otherwise any security, unless a registration statement
has been filed as to such security[.]” Id. § 77e(c).
When the accounts to CFT and FxWinning were first created, they constituted
securities.
Section 2(1) of the Securities Act and Section 39(a)(10) of the Exchange act
define a “security” to include, inter alia, “any investment contract,” which the United States
Supreme Court has defined to be: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3)
with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. S.E.C. v. W.J. Howey, 328
U.S. 293, 298-299 (1946).
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 29 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
a. An investment of money. Plaintiffs invested millions of dollars with CFT and
FxWinning based on Defendants’ representations of a high-frequency trading
system and unique algorithm.
b. A common enterprise. “A common enterprise exists where the fortunes of the
investor are interwoven with and dependent on the efforts and success of those
seeking the investment or of third parties.” T.J. Eberhardt v. Waters, 901 F.2d
1578 (11th Cir. 1990). The thrust of the common enterprise test is that the
investors have no desire to perform chores necessary for a return and are
attracted to the investment solely by the prospects of a return. S.E.C. v. Unique
Fin. Concepts, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1332 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (rejecting defendants'
arguments that the investments offered were currency transactions exempt from
regulation where defendants actually offered a fractional interest in a currency
trading program (i.e., in an investment contract that involved foreign currency
options) and maintained complete control over the purported transactions).
CFT and FxWinning did not sell individual foreign currencies to Plaintiffs.
Instead, CFT and FxWinning touted their combined platform(s) and software,
to which CFT mandated that any account holder for CFT open an account
through FxWinning (and in pari passu, that through the FxWinning brokerage
account, the investor could access CFT’s “High-Frequency Trading System”).
CFT received both commissions from FxWinning for investor sign ups as well
as a management fee up to 50% from investors for managing their purported
accounts on FxWinning. CFT and FxWinning also held several joint marketing
events: in Miami at CFT Masterminds, in December in the Bahamas, and on a
Yacht with multiple Plaintiffs. Throughout the entire scheme, CFT pushed
Plaintiffs to continuously invest more and more in their CFT/FxWinning

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
accounts while touting the success of CFT’s and FxWinning’s trading platform
in-person and on its Telegram channel, among other forums. In short, investors’
fortunes in Defendants’ trading platform(s) were intrinsically tied together with
both CFT and FxWinning and reliant on CFT and FxWinning’s platform(s) and
unique HFT algorithm and purported account management, without any efforts
by Plaintiffs beyond their initial investment of money and account creation.
c. Expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Defendants touted
the platform(s) as offering extremely high returns that would make their
investors rich. CFT’s Telegram channel also stated that the “software licenses”
that enabled account holders to achieve such high returns were transferrable,
thus suggesting they could be sold and that, indeed, what CFT and FxWinning
offered were not foreign currencies in-and-of themselves, but the platform(s)
and software. And Plaintiffs’ expectation of profit was entirely dependent on
CFT and FxWinning’s platform(s) and the efforts of their executives and
officers.
Defendants promoted, solicited, or sold the accounts, i.e., the investments in
Defendants’ platform(s) and software, to Plaintiffs. But no registration statements have been
filed with the SEC or have been in effect with respect to Defendants’ platform(s) and software.
Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act provides in relevant part: “Any person
who offers or sells a security in violation of Section 77e of this title . . . shall be liable . . . to
the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity in any
court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest
thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or
for damages if he no longer owns the security.” 15 U.S.C. § 77l(a)(1).
Defendants have violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act.

(Violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and
17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5 – against Defendants CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, Cardenas, and
Brito Cutie)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
This claim is brought under § 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, against all
Defendants.
The Defendants: (a) employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; (b)
made untrue statements of material fact; and (c) engaged in acts, practices, and a course of
business that operated as a fraud and deceit upon Plaintiffs in violation of § 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.
As set forth above, Defendants, individually and in concert, directly and
indirectly, represented to Plaintiffs that their investment funds were held in accounts that would
be used by the Companies’ platform(s) and software for forex trading and that investors could
withdraw funds from the accounts at any time upon request.
Defendants’ representations were material to Plaintiffs and induced Plaintiffs to
invest their funds in Defendants’ schemes and artifices.
Defendants’ representations were made in connection with the purchase of
securities, as detailed above.
But Defendants knew that they in fact did not intend to honor the terms of
Plaintiffs’ investments and that the statements that Defendants made to solicit Plaintiffs’ funds
regarding the platform(s) and software were materially false and misleading.

Had Plaintiffs known that Defendants’ representations regarding the platform(s)
and software were false and misleading, Plaintiffs would not have invested with the
Companies.
As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, as alleged herein, Plaintiffs have
suffered economic damages in an amount to be established at trial.
Defendants are jointly and severally liable to Plaintiffs for substantial damages
that Plaintiffs have suffered in connection with their CFT and FxWinning accounts.
COUNT III
(Violation of the Commodities Exchange Act, Sections 6 and 25, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b, 6e, 6o,
and 25 – against Defendants CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
To the extent Defendants actually purchased and sold foreign currencies on
Plaintiffs’ behalf and did not sell a security, Defendants violated the Commodities Exchange
Act by selling such commodities.
Foreign exchange trading is subject to the Commodities Exchange Act. See,
e.g., Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Nawabi, No. 22-cv-00717 KJM JD (E.D. Cal.
Apr. 28, 2022) (concluding that the Commission had made a prima facie showing that
defendant committed violations of Sections 6b, 6k, 6m, and 6o by operating “a fraudulent
scheme in which Defendants solicited, accepted, and misappropriated funds for a pooled
investment in off-exchange leveraged or margined retail foreign currency exchange (‘forex’)
contracts” and “knowingly made fraudulent and material misrepresentations and omissions, in
both conversations and written communications, about their forex trading and returns to
persuade potential and existing pool participants (‘Pool Participants’) to transfer funds to
Defendants for the purpose of participating in a forex pool”); U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Comm’n v. Wright, No. 17 CV 4722-LTS-DCF (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2018) (concluding that
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 33 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act by engaging in fraudulent forex
transactions).
Commodity Exchange Act Section 6b makes it unlawful for any person, in or
in connection with the making of any contract of sale of any commodity to cheat or defraud
the other person, to willfully make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or
statement, or to willfully deceive or attempt to deceive another person by any means
whatsoever in regard to the contract.
Commodity Exchange Act Section 6e prohibits dealings by unregistered floor
traders or brokers in executing purchases and sales of any commodity.
Commodity Exchange Act Section 6o makes it unlawful for a commodity
trading advisor, pool operator, or associated person to, by use of the mails or other means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce, employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
client or participant, or engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates
as a fraud or deceit.
Commodity Exchange Act Section 25 provides that a private right of action to
any person who received trading advice from a violator for a fee, made through such person
any contract of sale of any commodity or swap, who deposited with or paid to such person
money, securities, or other property in connection with any order to make such contract or any
swap, who purchased from or sold to such person or placed through such person an order for
purchase or sale of an interest or participation in a commodity pool or a swap, or who used
manipulative devices or contrivances in connection with the swap or contract of sale of a
commodity.
As described above, Defendants each made false statements, used a false
scheme, and/or intended to and thereafter did cheat Plaintiffs in connection with contracts for

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
the sale of a commodity or a commodity pool, in violation of Sections 6b, 6e, and 6o of the
Commodity Exchange Act.
As a result of Defendants wrongful conduct, as alleged herein, Plaintiffs have
suffered economic damages in an amount to be established at trial, but at least $27,000,000.00.
COUNT IV
(Violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act, Sections 517.301 and
517.211 – against Defendants CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
The investments made by Plaintiffs were “securities” as defined by the Florida
Securities and Investor Protection Act, Section 517.301, Florida Statutes, et seq. (the “Florida
Act”).
Section 517.301 makes it unlawful for a person, in connection with the offer,
sale, or purchase of any investment or security, directly or indirectly:
a. To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;
b. To obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material
fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; or
c. To engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or
would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a person.
As alleged, Defendants violated the Florida Act by, among other things: (i)
employing a device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (ii) making untrue statements of material
facts and omitting to state material facts that would render the statements misleading in light
of the circumstances under which they are made; (iii) engaging in an act, practice, or course of
business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a person; and (iv) knowingly

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up, by any trick, scheme, or device, a material
fact, making any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using
any false writing or document, knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement or entry.
The Florida Act provides for civil liability for these violations:
Any person purchasing or selling a security in violation of s. 517.301, and every
director, officer, partner, or agent of or for the purchaser or seller, if the director, officer,
partner, or agent has personally participated or aided in making the sale or purchase, is
jointly and severally liable to the person selling the security to or purchasing the
security from such person in an action for rescission, if the plaintiff still owns the
security, or for damages, if the plaintiff has sold the security.
Section 517.211.
Plaintiffs are each “person[s] … purchasing the security” from Defendants, and
each Defendant constitutes either a person selling the security, or a director, officer or agent of
the seller who personally participated or aided in making the sale.
Defendants have directly sold securities to Plaintiffs or have aided in making
the sale of securities as a director, officer, partner, or agent of the seller for such securities.
Pursuant to the Florida Act, the Defendants are jointly and severally liable to
Plaintiffs as sellers of the securities.
Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, directly and indirectly injured and
damaged, as a result of Defendants’ schemes, acts, practices, and courses of business which
operated to deceive Plaintiffs relative to the investments in question, pursuant to the securities
laws of the State of Florida, and have suffered financial losses in an amount to be proven at
trial.

COUNT VII
(Fraud in the Inducement – against Defendants CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, Cardenas,
and Brito Cutie)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
As alleged herein, Defendants represented to Plaintiffs, among other things, that
CFT and FxWinning were partners, that investing money with FxWinning was the exclusive
means by which to gain access to CFT’s trading platform, that CFT and FxWinning were
operating successful companies, that Defendants would use investment funds to engage in
forex trading, and that investors could withdraw the funds invested in the Companies upon
request.
Defendants’ representations were false and intended to deceive and mislead
Plaintiffs as to the terms of the investment opportunity.
Defendants (including de Rocha, Brito Cutie, and Cardenas), acting personally
and as agents and executives of, and in concert with, CFT and FxWinning, fraudulently induced
Plaintiffs to transfer funds to the Companies.
As alleged herein, the Companies have failed to honor their own terms and have
improperly withheld more than $27 million of Plaintiffs’ funds.
As alleged herein, Defendants knew the Companies were operating under
common ownership, in concert, and were set up to defraud investors.

COUNT IX
(Conversion – against all Defendants)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
Defendants accepted millions of dollars from Plaintiffs as a result of
representations including the promise that Plaintiffs would have the ability to withdraw their
funds upon request, at any time.
To the contrary, Defendants have prevented the withdrawal of Plaintiffs’ funds
since January 2023.
As of the date of this complaint, Plaintiffs’ funds in their CFT/FxWinning
accounts total more than $27 million. Plaintiffs’ accounts are identified by the last three digits,
above.
Plaintiffs are the rightful owners of the funds in their accounts.
Inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ ownership rights, Defendants’ refusal to permit
Plaintiffs to withdraw funds from their accounts has deprived Plaintiffs of their funds
permanently or for an indefinite time.
The actions of Defendants constitute an unlawful conversion of Plaintiffs’
interest in the funds.
As a result, Defendants have wrongfully converted $27 million of Plaintiffs’
funds.
Plaintiffs are entitled to an award for their damages, plus costs and interest.

COUNT X
(Unjust Enrichment – against all Defendants)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
The Defendants will be unjustly enriched if they are allowed to retain Plaintiffs’
funds.
As set forth above, Plaintiffs transferred funds to the Companies through their
accounts.
Defendants received the funds, and upon information and belief Individual
Defendants also obtained commissions and other financial benefits from the deposit of
Plaintiffs’ funds including CFT’s receipt of account managements fees.
Defendants have failed to release Plaintiffs’ funds despite numerous requests in
accordance with Plaintiffs’ ownership rights in their funds, and their right to demand
withdrawal at any time upon request.
It would be inequitable and unjust for Defendants to retain the benefit of the
funds (and any commissions or other ill-gotten gains) under the circumstances.
Plaintiffs have been and will continue to suffer damages, in an amount no less
than $27,000,000.00, as a result of Defendants’ actions.

COUNT XI
(Civil Conspiracy – against all Defendants)
Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth
herein.
As set forth above, CFT, FxWinning, and the Individual Defendants acted with
a common purpose to defraud potential investors.
Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 41 of 44
CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
Defendants’ actions (including the representations discussed above) were done
in furtherance of Defendants’ common purpose.
Defendants established the Companies, and induced investors with promises of
a proprietary algorithm, high returns, and secure and segregated accounts, with a common
purpose to defraud Plaintiffs and divest Plaintiffs of millions of dollars. To wit:
a. Defendants CFT and FxWinning represented repeatedly that they had a platform
and software that could effectuate forex trading earning high returns for
Plaintiffs. But upon information and belief, no such platform or software
existed, no trading occurred, and instead CFT and FxWinning stole Plaintiffs’
money.
b. Defendant David Merino created the “software” and helped found FxWinning,
helping to launch the conspiracy to defraud Plaintiffs. Upon information and
belief, no “software” was ever created, though Merino was one of the architects
of the visual products and website that FxWinning demonstrated and made
available to Plaintiffs in order to convince them to invest.
c. Defendant Renan de Rocha Gomes Bastos founded CFT, oversaw CFT’s
operations as its CEO, was a primary salesperson for both CFT and
FxWinning’s platform, hosted Zoom sessions touting both CFT and
FxWinning’s success, and hosted Plaintiffs on a yacht and in the Bahamas at
which he pushed Plaintiffs to increase their investments.
d. Defendant Arthur Percy was CFT’s COO and similarly oversaw CFT’s
operations and finances, including, upon information and belief, the
management fees that CFT earned and commissions its executives and
representatives received, including for himself.

CASE NO. 1:23-cv-23139-SCOLA/GOODMAN
e. Defendant Rafael Brito Cutie was FxWinning’s co-owner and CEO. In addition
to creating and helping to found FxWinning and overseeing its daily operations,
upon information and belief, Brito Cutie oversaw the purported updated
KYC/AML procedures and falsely represented for several months that
investors’ funds were not lost and would be returned once the KYC/AML
processes were complete. Upon information and belief, Brito Cutie’s
representations were designed to buy Defendants time to syphon Plaintiffs’
money and distribute it through various means (including the blockchain) to the
Individual Defendants.
f. Defendant Roman Cardenas was FxWinning’s vice president in charge of its
U.S. operations in Florida and attended events (including on the Yacht with de
Rocha) at which he pushed Plaintiffs to increase their investments and
represented the high profits that Defendants’ platform and software earned.
Upon information and belief, discovery will uncover further acts that each
Defendant undertook as part of their shared conspiracy to defraud Plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs have suffered more than $27,000,000.00 in damages as a direct and
proximate result of Defendants’ conspiracy.
Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be
proven at trial, but at least $27,000,000.00, against Defendants, plus costs and interest.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment in their favor and against Defendants as
follows:
A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no
less than $27,000,000.00.
