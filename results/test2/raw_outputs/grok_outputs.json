      "summary": "Lead Plaintiffs United Association National Pension Fund (UANPF) and Saskatchewan Healthcare Employees’ Pension Plan (SHEPP) bring this securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of Carvana Co. ('Carvana') Class A common stock during the Class Period of May 6, 2020, to November 3, 2022, alleging a pump-and-dump scheme by Exchange Act Defendants Carvana, Ernest Garcia III (CEO/Chairman), Mark Jenkins (CFO), Ryan Keeton (Chief Brand Officer), Benjamin Huston (COO), and Ernest Garcia II (controlling shareholder). Additional Securities Act claims arise from purchasers in the April 2022 Public Offering against Carvana, certain directors/officers (Garcia III, Jenkins, Palmer, Maroone, Parikh, Platt, Sullivan), and underwriters (Citigroup, J.P. Morgan). Alleged misconduct: Defendants concealed that Carvana's hyper-growth in retail units was unsustainable, fueled by (i) lowered standards for buying low-quality vehicles from customers (leading to excess wholesale inventory, logistics strain); (ii) rapid expansion into 169 distant markets without infrastructure (causing high third-party costs, need for $4B ADESA acquisition); (iii) systematic title/registration violations (selling without title, illegal temporary plates from other states, resulting in state fines/suspensions); and (iv) pass-through sales with Garcia II's DriveTime inflating units without profit. Defendants touted scalable 'Amazon-like' model, efficient logistics, high GPU, sustainable growth via customer acquisitions, while burying true costs in SG&A. Key facts: 11 CWs detail poor vehicle quality, title chaos, logistics dysfunction; Garcia II sold $3.6B shares (modified 10b5-1 plans); other executives sold $200M+; state actions (MI, IL, NC, etc. suspensions/fines); stock fell 97%+ from $376 peak to $7.39 amid partial disclosures. Claims: Exchange Act §10(b)/10b-5 (scheme/misstatements), §20(a) (control), §20(A) (insider trading); Securities Act §11 (Registration Statement), §12(a)(2) (prospectus), §15 (control).

Defendants are Tesla, Inc., CEO Elon Musk, and Tesla's Board of Directors (Brad W. Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, James Murdoch, Kimbal Musk, and Linda Johnson Rice). The alleged misconduct centers on Musk's August 7, 2018 tweets ('Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured' and follow-ups like 'Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote'), an employee email/blog post, and an August 13 blog post, which falsely conveyed that funding for a $420/share going-private deal was secured and the deal was imminent, subject only to a shareholder vote. In reality, discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund were preliminary (a brief July 31 meeting with no terms agreed, including price, and contingent on a Middle East factory deemed a 'non-starter' by a board member); no funding commitments existed; no advisors retained; no shareholder outreach; Musk viewed odds at 50% with 'a lot of uncertainty'; structure for retail investors unprecedented/impossible. Musk's statements, disseminated via his Twitter (designated official Tesla channel since 2013), caused Tesla stock to surge ~11% (to $379.59), harming buyers at inflated prices and shorts (~$1.1B mark-to-market losses) forced to cover; options traders damaged by volatility. Price declined on revelations (e.g., Aug 17 NYT interview admitting no funding secured, no tweet review). Tesla republished Musk's statements. Board allegedly failed to oversee/correct Musk's Twitter use. SEC sued Musk (false statements) and Tesla (disclosure controls); both settled ($20M penalties each, Musk stepped down as Chair). Claims: Count I - §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against Tesla/Musk (fraud/scheme via false statements/omissions); Count II - §20(a) against Board (controlling person liability). Damages seek billions.",

Board's post-tweet actions (Aug 8 vague press release not affirming 'secured'; special committee; halting Musk tweets) do not aid/abet primary violation but suggest non-involvement. No allegations of Board scienter, specific misleading statements by directors, or failure-to-correct as primary violation (Tesla charged only with controls under Rule 13a-15, not §10b-5).

Alleged Misconduct: Defendants violated federal securities laws by making false/misleading statements and omissions in earnings calls, SEC filings (2023 10-K, Q1 2024 10-Q), and conferences, downplaying macroeconomic pressures (e.g., rising rates making customers price-sensitive), overstating stability/expansion of revenue from existing enterprise customers (95% of revenue, top 10 'big whales' like TikTok, Netflix at 37%), and claiming focus on existing customer growth despite internal knowledge of declines (throttled traffic, cancellations like Indeed/USAA, discounts, stagnant renewals), competitors catching up, and shift to new customer focus via 2024 sales comp plan; omitted known trends under Item 303. Key Facts: Supported by 7 detailed confidential witnesses (CWs: sales/account execs/managers 2021-2024) describing 2023 declines, customer demands, quota misses (only 30% met), all-hands meetings (Nightingale admitting big customer throttling Nov 2023), weekly Customer Ops meetings tracking low traffic (red status, tiger teams), Fastly App data, war room post-Q1 2024; discontinued DBNER/NRR metrics Q1 2024; insider sales (Nightingale ~$6M, Kisling ~$2M).

Plaintiffs allege that on July 25, 2023, in a press release and Q2 earnings call, Defendants falsely misrepresented that Vicor had entered a new agreement with a 'significant existing customer' (implied to be Nvidia or Google) for its next-generation 4G lateral power distribution design, expected to ramp production and deliveries in Q4 2023, reversing Vicor's declining revenues and backlog. This caused VICR stock to surge from $59 to over $93 (with 4.5M shares traded), forcing Plaintiffs to cover their short positions (initiated May-July 2023) at substantial losses (~$35/share average). On October 24, 2023 Q3 earnings call, Defendants allegedly backtracked, denying specificity about any single customer, pivoting to medium/long-term growth from new unidentified customers, causing the stock to crash over 20% to ~$39 (again 4.5M volume). A September 2024 press release (post-lawsuit) claimed $30M in non-cancellable bookings based on customer's 'allocation understanding,' which Plaintiffs call a cover-up lacking SEC filings or proof. Legal claims: Count One - Violations of §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) against all Defendants (misrepresentations/omissions with scienter, materiality, reliance via efficient market, causation, damages); Count Two - Violations of §20(a) control person liability against Vinciarelli.

No loss causation: October 'disclosure' denies prior specificity but reveals no new 'truth' contradicting July statements. Scienter not strongly inferred (Tellabs, 551 U.S. 308): generic motives (Vinciarelli's ownership, $1M insider sales post-surge, anti-short squeeze) insufficient without contemporaneous falsity evidence; 'core operations' inference weak given Vicor's access/explanations; backpedaling consistent with non-binding customer plans.

Evidence includes analyst reports speculating discovery during CIS sale due diligence (announced Oct/Nov 2021), updated Dec. 7, 2021 installation manual warnings on cracking, and Jan. 20, 2022 preannouncement causing 16.9% stock drop (from $19.02 to $15.80).

Defendants: Walmart Inc. ('Company'), CEO Douglas C. McMillon, CFO M. Brett Biggs ('Individual Defendants'). Alleged Misconduct: Walmart systematically violated CSA (2011-2020+) by filling invalid opioid prescriptions (ignoring red flags, pill mills), failing to report suspicious orders as distributor (until 2018); concealed via omissions in SEC filings (no disclosure of 2011 DEA MOA, >50 DEA admonition letters, 2016-2020 EDTX DOJ Criminal/Civil Investigations despite near-indictment 2018, board/exec awareness of severe risks); false claims of full liability disclosures (violating Item 103 Reg S-K, ASC 450 GAAP), boilerplate risks as hypothetical when actual, false 'opioid stewardship' PR, tainted SOX certs. Key Facts: Internal docs (2013-15) admit no SOM/RTF systems, sales over compliance; 2016 DEA raid triggers Criminal Investigation; 2018 EDTX intent to indict (averted via lobbying/hiring ex-DOJ Brand); parallel Civil Investigation escalates (Working Group, omnibus subpoena); Opioid MDL findings/verdicts confirm violations; Corrective Disclosures: Mar 25, 2020 ProPublica exposé (~5% stock drop); Dec 22, 2020 DOJ complaint (~1.9% drop).

Some plaintiffs have agreed to arbitrate specified claims against CFT, de Rocha, and Percy, but proceed against FxWinning, Brito, Cardenas, and Merino. Alleged Misconduct: Defendants fraudulently promoted a high-frequency trading (HFT) platform and algorithm promising high returns (e.g., 410% profits), fund security, regulation, insurance, and unfettered withdrawals, while pooling funds, charging fees (40-50%), and exerting total control via limited powers of attorney. Initial small withdrawals lulled investors; larger ones blocked from early 2023 under pretext of KYC/AML procedures (falsely claimed completed), resulting in $27M+ withheld. Misrepresentations included fake KPMG audit, non-existent regulation/CMI, fabricated dashboards/returns, and no actual trading; Defendants allegedly pocketed funds for personal use (e.g., real estate). Key Facts: Accounts opened Feb. 2021-Feb. 2023 (class period approximated thereby); promotions via Telegram, Zoom, websites, events (Miami Mastermind, yacht party, Bahamas summit with paid speakers); joint marketing; international press/regulatory scrutiny as Ponzi scheme. Legal Claims: Eleven counts including federal securities (Securities Act §§5/12(a)(1), Exchange Act §10(b)/Rule 10b-5), CEA fraud, Florida securities violations, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud in inducement, negligent misrepresentation, conversion, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy.

Lead Plaintiffs are The Phoenix Insurance Company Ltd. and The Phoenix Pension & Provident Funds; consolidated Plaintiff is City of Melbourne Firefighters’ Retirement System.

Alleged misconduct: Defendants touted ATI's 'high retention,' 'low turnover,' 'competitive compensation,' and 'attractive recruiting/retention capabilities' for physical therapists (key to business), projected 2021 revenue of $731M, Adj. EBITDA $119M, 90+ new clinics, and reported overstated goodwill ($1.33B) and intangibles ($644M), while omitting severe attrition (up to 41% vs. industry ~20%), toxic culture, furloughs, understaffing, inability to meet demand/staff clinics, rising labor costs, and inevitable guidance cuts/impairments. Supported by 7 former employees (FEs from HQ/clinics) detailing weekly/monthly reports to execs (Diab/Jordan received/discussed attrition), databases, meetings. Key facts: Pre-Class attrition spiked late 2020; merger rushed; post-merger July 26, 2021 disclosure admitted attrition prevented meeting demand, cut guidance (revenue to $640-670M, EBITDA $60-70M, clinics 55-65), HR chief Coco terminated (stock fell 62% over 2 days); Diab terminated Aug; Aug 16 impairments ($433M goodwill, $34M trade name for H1 2021); Oct 19 further cuts (revenue $620-630M, EBITDA $40-44M, lower visits; stock -22%); SEC document request Nov 2021.

Key facts: Phase 2a (launched Oct. 2019, enrollment completed Sep. 2020) required patients with 'meaningful word recognition deficits,' but undisclosed criteria leaked on tinnitus forums (e.g., Tinnitus Talk post Feb. 13, 2020, revealing ≤85% word recognition score needed); desperate tinnitus sufferers allegedly faked tests to enroll for early access, tainting the study with self-selection bias. Evidence includes forum posts, CW1 (Senior Manager of Clinical Operations, Trial Manager for Phase 2a, reported to LeBel), who confirmed patients faked tests, criteria disseminated online, investigators reported discrepancies to LeBel, and Company monitored forums. Defendants allegedly knew of bias by Class Period start but claimed proper enrollment ('all subjects have meaningful word recognition deficits'), data would inform FDA pivotal trials, etc. Lucchino accelerated insider sales (avg. 57k shares/month Class Period vs. 15k pre, netting $9M).

      "summary": "This is a securities class action brought by Lead Plaintiffs Handelsbanken Fonder AB, Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, State of Rhode Island Employees’ Retirement System, and Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund against Wells Fargo & Co. ('Wells Fargo' or 'the Bank') and Individual Defendants Timothy J. Sloan (former CEO), John R. Shrewsberry (former CFO), Charles W. Scharf (CEO), C. Allen Parker (former General Counsel and interim CEO), and Elizabeth 'Betsy' Duke (former Board Chair) (collectively, 'Insider Defendants'). The proposed Class consists of all persons who purchased or acquired Wells Fargo common stock during the Class Period from February 2, 2018, to March 12, 2020, and were damaged thereby. The alleged misconduct involves Defendants' false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Wells Fargo's compliance with 2018 Consent Orders imposed by the Federal Reserve Board ('FRB'), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC'), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB') following prior scandals involving unauthorized accounts and other abuses. These Orders required submission of Stage 1 Plans detailing remediation, followed by implementation (Stage 2) and validation (Stage 3); non-compliance prolonged an FRB-imposed asset cap limiting growth. Key facts: Defendants repeatedly assured investors that compliant plans were 'in place,' the Bank was 'executing' or 'implementing' them, and the asset cap would lift soon (e.g., H1 2019), despite regulators' multiple written rejections of Stage 1 Plans as 'materially incomplete,' 'poor-quality,' 'a plan for a plan,' with rebukes, extension requests, internal admissions of failure (e.g., 'totally biffed it'), Sloan's false congressional testimony, toned-down SEC disclosures, resignations (Sloan, Duke), clawbacks, and 2020 House Financial Services Committee Reports confirming misrepresentations. Truth emerged gradually via earnings calls (Jan/Apr 2019, Jan 2020) extending timelines and admitting substantial work remaining, culminating in House Reports/hearings (Mar 2020), causing over $54B in market cap losses. Legal claims: Count I (§10(b)/Rule 10b-5) against Wells Fargo, Sloan, Shrewsberry, Parker, Duke; Count II (§20(a) control liability) against all Insider Defendants.",

Alleged misconduct: Facing SPAC deadline pressure and redemptions reducing trust from $205M to ~$62M, TDAC rushed merger with non-energy Lottery (online lottery platform) despite inadequate due diligence.

The alleged misconduct involves false and misleading statements about Spectrum's drug candidate poziotinib ('pozi'), an investigational TKI for previously treated NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 mutations. Spectrum sought accelerated FDA approval ('AA') via NDA filed November 2021, based on Phase 2 Cohort 2 data (16 mg QD dose), with PINNACLE Phase 3 confirmatory trial planned at 8 mg BID.

Joseph Wright, and Treasurer/SVP/CAO/former CFO Brenda R. Schroer. Alleged misconduct: Defendants made false/misleading statements touting Concho's validated, low-risk 'manufacturing mode' or 'large-scale development' in Permian Basin (tight well spacing, cube/zipper fracturing, multi-well pads like flagship 23-well Dominator project), claiming proper modeling for spacing/parent-child interference, dispersed risk, and justifying raised production forecasts/guidance (e.g., 20-30% growth). Key facts: Internal warnings from former employees (FEs 1-9) ignored by executives (esp. Giraud in meetings he led); no/inadequate risking/modeling; ~90% 2018 budget on high-risk projects lacking balance; live data showed early failures; Dominator/other projects underperformed peers (low IP rates); post-Class Period admissions (spacing 'too tight' on Dominator/multiple projects, rig cuts from 33 to 18, guidance slashed, 16% proved reserves cut due to spacing tests). Stock fell 22% ($97.68 to $75.97) on high volume Aug. 1, 2019, after 2Q19 results. Claims: Count I - §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 (all Defendants); Count II - §20(a) control liability (Individuals).",

Giraud), temporal proximity to drop; (4) reliance/loss causation via efficiency/inflation/drop tied to truth (¶¶406-412). Not puffery/boilerplate; safe harbor inapplicable (mixed present/puff/forward-looking w/o adequate cautions)."
