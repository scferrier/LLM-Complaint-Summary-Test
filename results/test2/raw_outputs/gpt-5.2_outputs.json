      "summary": "This putative securities class action is brought by Lead Plaintiffs United Association National Pension Fund (“UANPF”) and Saskatchewan Healthcare Employees’ Pension Plan (“SHEPP”) on behalf of (1) a class of purchasers of Carvana Co. (“Carvana” or the “Company”) Class A common stock from May 6, 2020 through November 3, 2022 (the “Class Period”), and (2) a separate Securities Act class of purchasers in Carvana’s April 2022 public offering (the “2022 Public Offering”).\n\nParties. The principal defendant is Carvana, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, whose Class A common stock trades on the NYSE (CVNA). The “Exchange Act Defendants” include Carvana and four senior executives/founders—Ernest Garcia III (CEO/President/Chairman), Mark Jenkins (CFO), Ryan Keeton (Chief Brand Officer), and Benjamin Huston (COO)—and Carvana’s controlling shareholder and co-founder Ernest Garcia II (Garcia Senior). The complaint alleges Garcia Senior controlled Carvana through a dual-class structure conferring approximately 80%+ voting power and exercised de facto control despite a prior fraud felony conviction that allegedly barred him from NYSE-company employment. \n\nFor the Securities Act claims tied to the 2022 Public Offering, defendants include Carvana; certain signatories to the registration statement (Garcia Junior, Jenkins, Stephen Palmer (VP Accounting/Finance), and directors Michael Maroone, Neha Parikh, Ira Platt, and Gregory Sullivan); and underwriters Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.\n\nAlleged fraudulent conduct / misconduct. Plaintiffs plead a “classic pump-and-dump scheme” in which defendants allegedly: (i) inflated Carvana’s reported retail unit growth and portrayed it as sustainable and profitable, while (ii) concealing that growth depended on unsustainable and unlawful practices that increased costs and regulatory exposure, and (iii) used the inflated stock price to sell approximately $3.87 billion of insider holdings (with Garcia Senior allegedly realizing over $3.6 billion).\n\nKey factual allegations supporting the claims. The complaint centers on three operational themes allegedly concealed or misrepresented:\n\n1) Growth-at-any-cost vehicle acquisition and inventory quality. Plaintiffs allege Carvana abruptly accelerated buying cars from customers (including trade-ins) by lowering verification and purchasing standards, overpaying for poor-quality vehicles, accepting misrepresented vehicles, and tolerating internal overrides of appraisals. Confidential witnesses describe “buy everything” directives, acceptance of inoperable/unsafe vehicles, and a resulting surge in vehicles that had to be diverted to wholesale.\n\n2) Unsustainable geographic expansion and logistics costs. Plaintiffs allege Carvana expanded into 150+ new markets without sufficient inspection/reconditioning infrastructure (IRCs), causing long-distance vehicle moves, reliance on expensive third-party logistics, and rising SG&A/logistics costs. Plaintiffs contend defendants touted a “capital-light,” scalable logistics network while internally facing dysfunction, inventory backlogs, and rising per-unit costs—especially in markets far from IRCs.\n\n3) Title and registration violations and regulatory backlash. Plaintiffs allege Carvana systematically sold vehicles before holding title, failed to timely register vehicles, and issued out-of-state temporary tags, contrary to state law. Confidential witnesses describe pervasive missing-title problems, internal tracking spreadsheets, repeated revamps of the title department, customer complaints, and management awareness. Plaintiffs cite regulatory actions and suspensions/probations in multiple states (including North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, Ohio, Maryland) and allege these were foreseeable consequences of the concealed practices.\n\nAdditional alleged misconduct includes (a) “pass-through” retail sales arrangements with DriveTime (a Garcia-affiliated entity) that allegedly inflated reported retail unit sales without economic substance for Carvana in some instances, and (b) alleged manipulation of a key profitability metric (Total GPU) by excluding outbound logistics and title/registration expenses from cost of sales, thereby overstating per-unit profitability.\n\nAlleged misstatements/omissions. Plaintiffs identify a large set of statements in earnings releases, shareholder letters, SEC filings (10-Qs/10-K), conference calls, and presentations that allegedly misrepresented: (i) the sustainability and profitability of retail unit growth; (ii) the rigor and profitability of buying cars from customers; (iii) the efficiency and scalability of the logistics network and “capital-light” expansion; (iv) the quality of inventory and inspections; (v) the scope and severity of title/registration problems (often minimized as limited, unusual, or pandemic-related); and (vi) the causes of cost increases (attributing them to “transitory” macro factors rather than defendants’ operational choices).\n\nClass period and significant dates. The Exchange Act class period is May 6, 2020 through November 3, 2022. Key dates/events alleged include: March 30, 2020 direct offering enabling Garcia Senior to buy low; May 6, 2020 start-of-period disclosures; August 10–11, 2021 disclosure of North Carolina suspension; October 22, 2021 Wall Street Journal report on state scrutiny; April 20–29, 2022 Q1 2022 results and equity/debt financings tied to ADESA; May 10–11, 2022 layoffs/operating plan; June 24–28, 2022 Barron’s “Undriveable Cars” exposé; October 7–10, 2022 Michigan suspension; and November 3–7, 2022 Q3 2022 results and sharp stock decline. The Securities Act sub-class concerns the April 2022 Public Offering: shelf registration filed April 20, 2022; prospectus supplement filed April 25, 2022; offering completed April 26, 2022; plaintiffs allege they purchased in the offering on April 22, 2022 at $80/share.\n\nLegal claims asserted. Exchange Act claims: (Count I) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (misstatements/omissions and scheme liability) against the Exchange Act Defendants; (Count II) Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Exchange Act Defendants; and (Count III) Section 20A insider trading against Garcia Senior, Jenkins, Keeton, and Huston (based on contemporaneous trading). Securities Act claims for the 2022 Public Offering: (Count IV) Section 11 against issuer, signatories, and underwriters; (Count V) Section 12(a)(2) against Securities Act defendants (including underwriters) for offers/sales by means of a prospectus; and (Count VI) Section 15 control-person liability against the Individual Securities Act Defendants.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission (or a deceptive scheme), (2) scienter, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, (5) economic loss, and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require particularity as to the “who, what, when, where, and why” of the alleged misstatements, and a “strong inference” of scienter that is “cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.”\n\n1) Material misstatements/omissions and falsity. The complaint pleads a detailed set of challenged statements in SEC filings, earnings calls, shareholder letters, and investor presentations, and ties them to specific alleged contrary facts: (i) that retail unit growth was driven by lowered purchasing/verification standards, overpaying and accepting poor-quality vehicles, and a resulting increase in wholesale disposals; (ii) that market expansion was not “capital-light” and created long-distance logistics costs and constraints; (iii) that Carvana’s title/registration practices allegedly violated state laws and created pervasive delays; and (iv) that the Company’s profitability presentation (Total GPU) allegedly omitted significant per-unit costs (outbound logistics and title/registration) that management allegedly considered part of unit economics.\n\nAt the pleading stage, these allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege falsity and misleading half-truths. Defendants’ statements were not limited to vague corporate optimism; plaintiffs identify concrete representations about how vehicles were assessed (“quality,” “expected reconditioning costs,” “in-demand and profitable vehicles”), about the efficiency and predictability of the logistics network, about the ability to expand markets with “limited incremental investment,” and about the scope of title/registration problems. When a defendant chooses to speak on a subject, it must speak fully and truthfully; plaintiffs plausibly allege defendants’ descriptions of the drivers of growth, profitability, and operational capability omitted known adverse facts that rendered the statements misleading.\n\nTo the extent some statements (e.g., “our business gets better as it gets bigger,” “we remain firmly on the path,” “best experiences,” “excited”) could be characterized as puffery, the complaint also pleads numerous actionable statements of present or historical fact and operational capability. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied as to falsity/materiality.\n\n2) Scienter. Plaintiffs plead multiple scienter indicia that, taken together, support a strong inference at least as compelling as nonfraudulent explanations: (a) magnitude and timing of insider sales (alleged billions in sales, concentrated before major negative disclosures); (b) allegations of Garcia Senior’s control and involvement; (c) confidential witness accounts describing pervasive operational problems (inventory quality, titles, logistics) and management awareness through meetings, all-hands calls, and leadership summits; (d) allegations that key executives responsible for the relevant operations (particularly the COO) had access to internal metrics and systems (Tableau/SQL, title spreadsheets) reflecting the adverse conditions; and (e) alleged minimization of known regulatory issues as “small in scope” or “miscommunication.”\n\nAt this stage, the Court does not weigh competing inferences as to ultimate truth; it asks whether plaintiffs plead particularized facts supporting a cogent inference of at least recklessness. The complaint meets that burden.\n\n3) Reliance. Plaintiffs plead reliance under Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption for an NYSE-traded security and also invoke Affiliated Ute for omissions. These allegations suffice at the motion stage.\n\n4) Loss causation. Plaintiffs plead a series of partial corrective disclosures tied to the alleged concealed risks and practices (state suspensions and press investigations into title/registration; disclosures of operational constraints and cost issues; layoffs and operating-plan changes; and the eventual disclosure of declining retail sales) and plead stock price declines in temporal proximity. That is sufficient to plead loss causation and economic loss.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count I is denied."

          "claim": "Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 20(a) imposes joint and several liability on a “controlling person” who controls a primary violator, unless the defendant acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs must allege (1) a primary violation of the Exchange Act and (2) control.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is sustained, plaintiffs have adequately alleged a primary violation.\n\nControl. Plaintiffs plead that Garcia Junior and Jenkins, as CEO/Chairman and CFO who signed SEC filings and spoke on earnings calls, exercised control over the Company’s public statements and disclosures. Plaintiffs also plead that Huston and Keeton, as senior officers and founders, had operational authority and participated in communications to the market. As to Garcia Senior, plaintiffs plead majority voting power, de facto control, related-party dominance, and influence over corporate decisions.\n\nThese allegations plausibly plead control for Section 20(a) purposes. Any good-faith defense is fact-intensive and not resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count II is denied."

          "claim": "Section 20(A) of the Exchange Act (insider trading)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 20A provides a private right of action against a person who violates the Exchange Act by trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, to contemporaneous traders. Plaintiffs must plead: (1) a predicate Exchange Act violation (typically Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 insider trading), (2) a purchase or sale by the defendant while in possession of material nonpublic information, and (3) contemporaneous trading by the plaintiff.\n\nPredicate violation and material nonpublic information. Because the complaint adequately pleads a primary securities fraud scheme and management knowledge of concealed operational and regulatory problems, it plausibly pleads that senior insiders possessed material nonpublic information about the sustainability of growth, per-unit economics, title/registration violations, and the scope of regulatory exposure at the times alleged.\n\nTrading and contemporaneousness. The complaint pleads specific insider sales by Garcia Senior, Jenkins, Keeton, and Huston and pleads contemporaneous purchases by plaintiffs (with detailed tables). That suffices at the pleading stage.\n\nDefendants’ arguments that some sales were pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans do not warrant dismissal at this stage; the existence, timing, and modification of such plans are fact issues and, in any event, do not negate the plausibility of possession of MNPI for Section 20A pleading purposes.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count III is denied."

          "claim": "Section 11 of the Securities Act (2022 Public Offering)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 11 imposes liability on issuers, signatories, directors, and underwriters for a registration statement that, at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading. Issuer liability is strict; other defendants may assert due diligence defenses, not resolved on a motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs must plead standing (purchase traceable to the offering) and material misstatement/omission.\n\nStanding/traceability. Plaintiffs allege they purchased shares directly in the 2022 Public Offering from an underwriter at the offering price. That is sufficient.\n\nMaterial misstatement/omission. Plaintiffs allege the registration statement incorporated the 2021 10-K and other disclosures that touted scalable, cost-efficient logistics, “capital-light” expansion, robust inventory acquisition and inspection, and framed title/registration issues largely as risks and operational challenges rather than ongoing widespread violations and delays. Plaintiffs allege that, by April 2022, Carvana was already experiencing mounting logistics constraints and costs, inventory quality problems and excess wholesale, and widespread title/registration failures that had already triggered regulatory discipline in some jurisdictions.\n\nAt the pleading stage, these allegations plausibly state that the offering documents contained materially misleading half-truths and inadequate risk disclosures (risk-factor warnings do not immunize a registrant if the warned-of risk has already materialized and is not fairly disclosed).\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count IV is denied."

          "claim": "Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act (2022 Public Offering)",
          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 12(a)(2) provides rescission/damages against a statutory “seller” who offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication containing a material misstatement or omission. A defendant is a statutory seller if it (1) passed title to the plaintiff, or (2) successfully solicited the purchase for its own financial gain. Plaintiffs must also plead that the securities were sold pursuant to a prospectus.\n\nMisstatement/omission. For the reasons stated under Section 11, plaintiffs plausibly plead material misstatements/omissions in the prospectus materials.\n\nStatutory seller requirement. Plaintiffs allege they purchased in the offering directly from Citigroup; that suffices to plead Citigroup as a statutory seller. Plaintiffs also plead underwriter solicitation generally. However, the complaint does not plead with sufficient specificity that all non-selling defendants (e.g., issuer and individual signatories/directors) directly solicited plaintiffs’ purchases within the meaning of Pinter v. Dahl, as opposed to participating in preparing offering documents.\n\nThus, the Section 12(a)(2) claim is sustained as to Citigroup (and, to the extent plaintiffs can plead and prove solicitation, potentially as to other underwriters), but dismissed as to defendants for whom the complaint does not plausibly allege statutory-seller status.\n\nAccordingly, Count V is dismissed in part."

Plaintiffs must plead (1) a primary violation and (2) control.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Section 11 claim survives, plaintiffs have pleaded a primary Securities Act violation.\n\nControl. Plaintiffs plead that the individual Securities Act defendants were senior officers and directors who signed the registration statement and allegedly had the power to influence and control the issuer’s statements in the offering documents. Those allegations suffice at the pleading stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count VI is denied."

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action brought by Lead Plaintiff Glen Littleton on behalf of a putative class of all persons and entities who purchased or sold Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) securities (including common stock and exchange-traded options) during the period August 7, 2018 through August 17, 2018 (the “Class Period”), and were allegedly damaged thereby.\n\nParties. Plaintiff is Glen Littleton, who alleges he purchased and sold Tesla common stock and options during the Class Period. Defendants are: (1) Tesla, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California, whose common stock traded on NASDAQ under ticker TSLA; (2) Elon R. Musk, Tesla’s CEO and (at the time) Chairman and principal public spokesperson; and (3) Tesla’s Board of Directors, sued as “control persons” under Section 20(a): Brad W. Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio J. Gracias, James Murdoch, Kimbal Musk, and Linda Johnson Rice (collectively, the “Board”).\n\nAlleged fraudulent conduct/misconduct. The complaint centers on Musk’s August 7, 2018 public statements—primarily via Twitter, which Tesla had previously identified as an “official channel” for dissemination of company information—announcing that he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420” and that “Funding [was] secured,” and later that “Investor support is confirmed” and that the “only reason” the transaction was not certain was a shareholder vote. Plaintiff alleges these statements (and related tweets and Tesla blog communications) were materially false and misleading because no financing was actually secured, key deal terms had not been negotiated, and the going-private transaction was at most a preliminary, uncertain concept.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity. Plaintiff alleges that, despite the market impression created by Musk’s tweets and related communications, Musk had not reached any binding commitment or agreement to fund a $420-per-share going-private transaction, had not negotiated key terms (including price) with any funding source, had not retained advisors at the time of the initial tweets, had not assessed shareholder/institutional/retail feasibility, and had not determined regulatory requirements. The complaint describes Musk’s contacts with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (“PIF”) as preliminary and contingent, including a purported contingency about building a Tesla production facility in the Middle East, which at least one Board member allegedly viewed as a “non-starter.” The complaint also alleges Musk privately believed the probability of consummating a going-private transaction was only about 50% at the time.\n\nMarket impact and loss allegations. Plaintiff alleges the August 7 “funding secured” tweet caused immediate market disruption: NASDAQ halted trading; Tesla’s stock rose materially (closing up about 10% that day); and short sellers and options traders suffered losses due to price movement and increased implied volatility. The complaint alleges that as information emerged casting doubt on the truth of “funding secured” (including press reports of SEC investigation and, critically, a New York Times interview published online after market close August 16 and in print August 17 stating the PIF had not committed cash and no one reviewed the tweet before posting), Tesla’s stock fell sharply, including an approximately 9% drop on August 17, 2018.\n\nScienter/motive allegations. Plaintiff alleges Musk acted intentionally or with deliberate recklessness, motivated in part by animus toward short sellers (citing prior anti-short statements and conduct) and also by Tesla’s need to keep its stock price above a convertible bond conversion price to avoid cash repayment. Plaintiff further relies on the SEC enforcement actions filed in late September 2018 and subsequent settlements (including penalties and governance reforms) as support for an inference of scienter and as corroboration that the statements lacked an adequate factual basis.\n\nBoard-related allegations. Plaintiff alleges the Board, having identified Musk’s Twitter as an official disclosure channel and having oversight responsibility for Tesla’s public disclosures, had the power to control or correct Musk’s statements and failed timely to do so. The complaint cites the Board’s August 8 press release referencing discussion of funding and “appropriate next steps,” and alleges the Board later directed Musk to refrain from tweeting about the transaction without prior Board discussion.\n\nClaims asserted. The complaint asserts two causes of action: (1) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against Tesla and Musk for material misrepresentations/omissions and a fraudulent scheme in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; and (2) Section 20(a) against the Board as control persons of Tesla.\n\nSignificant dates. July 31, 2018: Musk meets with PIF representatives. August 2, 2018: Musk emails Board about an “Offer to Take Tesla Private at $420.” August 7, 2018: “Funding secured” tweet and follow-on tweets; NASDAQ trading halt; Tesla employee email/blog post; “Investor support is confirmed” tweet. August 8, 2018: Board press release; reports of SEC inquiry. August 13, 2018: Musk Tesla blog post attempting to explain “funding secured”; tweet about working with Silver Lake/Goldman as advisors. August 14, 2018: Tesla announces special committee; press reports question advisor engagement. August 16–17, 2018: New York Times interview/article reporting funding was far from secure; stock drops sharply on August 17. (Post-class-period context: August 24, 2018: Musk announces “Staying Public.” September 27–29, 2018: SEC files actions; October 16, 2018: judgments/settlements approved.)",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require particularity as to the alleged misstatements and why they were misleading, and require facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission. The complaint identifies with specificity the challenged statements (date/time, speaker, medium, and content), including: “Funding secured,” “Investor support is confirmed,” and statements implying shareholders could choose to cash out at $420 or remain invested in a private Tesla with periodic liquidity. These are not vague puffery; they are concrete assertions about the status of financing and investor support for a massive transaction and, if false, are plainly material to a reasonable investor. The complaint pleads falsity by alleging that no binding financing commitment existed, key terms (including price) were not discussed with the principal purported source (PIF), advisors were not retained at the time, and substantial contingencies remained. At the pleading stage, these allegations adequately state that “funding secured” and the related certainty-implying statements were misleading.\n\nDefendants’ likely arguments that the statements were merely preliminary “consideration” or forward-looking do not warrant dismissal on this record. Even if “considering” suggests some tentativeness, the phrase “Funding secured” is an assertion of present fact. Likewise, “Investor support is confirmed” and “only reason … is … shareholder vote” plausibly communicate that the transaction is effectively locked up except for a vote. The complaint plausibly alleges those impressions were false.\n\n2. Scienter. Under the PSLRA, the Court must consider whether the pleaded facts, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference that Musk acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness. The complaint alleges Musk personally controlled the relevant information: he was the participant in the PIF discussions; he allegedly had not negotiated price or terms; he allegedly believed the deal had only a 50% chance; and he allegedly knew of significant contingencies and missing steps. Those allegations support an inference that Musk knew (or was deliberately reckless in not knowing) that “funding secured” and the accompanying certainty framing lacked an adequate factual basis.\n\nThe complaint also pleads motive and opportunity—animus toward short sellers and the desire to pressure shorts—though motive is not required. The allegations of prior anti-short statements and conduct, coupled with the immediate market impact and Musk’s continued reiteration of certainty, further support scienter.\n\nThe Court does not treat the SEC settlements as admissions of liability in this private action, but the complaint’s reliance on the SEC’s contemporaneous allegations and the undisputed fact of enforcement proceedings and remedial measures may be considered as part of the overall mosaic at the pleading stage. In any event, the complaint independently pleads particularized facts about what Musk allegedly knew and did not have in hand when he made the statements.\n\nAs to Tesla, the complaint plausibly pleads corporate scienter through Musk as CEO and the alleged authorized use of his Twitter as an official disclosure channel, together with agency principles. At minimum, the complaint plausibly alleges Musk spoke with apparent authority on Tesla’s behalf and that his scienter is attributable to Tesla for pleading purposes.\n\n3. Connection with purchase/sale; reliance. The statements were made publicly and are alleged to have affected the market for Tesla stock and options. The complaint pleads an efficient market for TSLA and invokes Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. At the motion to dismiss stage, those allegations are sufficient to plead reliance for a class of market participants.\n\n4. Economic loss and loss causation. The complaint alleges that the stock price rose on the alleged misrepresentations and declined as the market learned information undermining the “funding secured” narrative, including the New York Times reporting that the PIF had not committed cash and that no one vetted the tweet. The complaint ties the August 17 decline to corrective disclosures and the dissipation of inflation. While some intervening reporting (SEC investigation news) may have contributed, loss causation does not require a single revelation or a full confession; it is enough to plead that the truth became known through a series of partial disclosures and that the price decline was plausibly caused by the materialization of the concealed risk or the revelation of the falsity. The complaint adequately pleads that linkage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim against Musk and Tesla."

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 20(a) imposes joint and several liability on a “controlling person” who controls a primary violator, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation. To plead Section 20(a), a plaintiff must allege (1) a primary violation by the controlled person/entity and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator’s general operations and the specific transaction or activity giving rise to the violation.\n\n1. Primary violation. Because the Section 10(b) claim is adequately pleaded at this stage, the primary-violation element is satisfied for pleading purposes.\n\n2. Control. The complaint’s control allegations as to the individual directors are largely conclusory. It alleges that directors, by virtue of their positions and oversight duties, had the power to influence Tesla’s disclosures and had “authority over and/or controlled” Musk’s Twitter because Tesla identified it as an official channel. But Section 20(a) requires more than status as a director and generalized oversight responsibilities; it requires plausible allegations of actual power to control the specific conduct at issue.\n\nHere, the alleged misstatements were made by Musk on August 7, 2018 without prior review by anyone, and the complaint itself emphasizes that no one saw or vetted the tweet before publication. That allegation undercuts the inference that the Board exercised actual control over the specific communications at the time they were made.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that after August 7, a director (Gracias) instructed Musk to refrain from tweeting about privatization without prior Board discussion, and that the Board issued an August 8 press release and later formed a special committee. Those allegations tend to show reactive governance steps after the initial alleged fraud, not preexisting control over the specific misstatements when made. Post hoc ability to influence future communications is not, without more, a plausible allegation that each director controlled the specific acts giving rise to the primary violation.\n\nNor does the complaint plead particularized facts showing that each director had the ability to prevent Musk’s tweets, directed or induced the challenged statements, or participated in drafting/approving them. The complaint does not allege, for example, that the Board approved the “funding secured” language, instructed Musk to make the statements, or had a disclosure-control mechanism in place that they exercised and overrode. Indeed, the complaint’s narrative is that such controls were lacking.\n\nBecause the complaint does not plausibly allege the requisite control by each individual director over the specific fraudulent conduct, the Section 20(a) claim against the Board is dismissed. Dismissal is without prejudice to amendment if Plaintiff can plead nonconclusory facts showing actual control (and, where required by circuit law, culpable participation) by the individual directors in the challenged communications."

Defendants are Netflix and four senior executives: Reed Hastings (Co-CEO/Chair), Ted Sarandos (Co-CEO), Spencer Neumann (CFO), and Gregory Peters (COO) (collectively, the “Individual Defendants”).\n\nThe complaint alleges that Netflix’s revenue model depended primarily on paid subscriptions and that investors focused heavily on “paid net adds” as a key operating metric.

According to the complaint, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic Netflix attributed slowing subscriber growth to “COVID pull-forward” dynamics and “choppiness,” while assuring investors that markets—particularly the U.S. and Canada (“UCAN”)—remained only about “60% penetrated” with “ample runway” and “headroom” for growth.\n\nThe alleged fraud centers on Netflix’s purported failure to disclose the true extent of account sharing and the resulting effective market saturation. Plaintiff alleges that, unbeknownst to investors, Netflix had extensive internal data showing that account sharing was massive (over 100 million additional households globally and over 30 million in UCAN) and that this meant Netflix was far more penetrated than its reported subscriber counts and public statements suggested—approximately 83–84% penetrated in UCAN (not ~60%), and approximately 35–36% globally (not ~24–25%). Plaintiff alleges that this undisclosed effective saturation materially hindered Netflix’s ability to add new paying subscribers, and that Netflix’s engagement and retention metrics were also misleadingly portrayed because non-paying sharers inflated viewing/engagement and reduced churn by increasing the perceived value of subscriptions.\n\nKey alleged misstatements/omissions include: (i) repeated assurances that UCAN was roughly 60% penetrated and that Netflix had significant headroom and runway for growth; (ii) repeated attribution of slowing acquisition and paid net adds primarily to COVID pull-forward, production delays, and macro conditions, while denying structural issues such as saturation; and (iii) risk-factor disclosures in Forms 10-K and 10-Q describing account sharing as a contingent risk (“if … abused” / “if … efforts … are ineffective”) rather than disclosing that multi-household sharing was already pervasive and materially affecting growth.\n\nThe complaint identifies two principal corrective-disclosure events. First, on January 20, 2022 (Q4’21 results), Netflix missed paid net adds guidance and issued weak Q1’22 guidance; the stock fell about 21.7% on January 21, 2022. Plaintiff characterizes this as a partial revelation of acquisition problems, though Netflix continued to attribute weakness to COVID/macro factors and denied structural saturation. Second, on April 19, 2022 (Q1’22 results), Netflix disclosed that it estimated over 100 million additional households were sharing accounts (including over 30 million in UCAN) and admitted that high household penetration including sharing, combined with competition, created revenue-growth headwinds; Netflix also reported a subscriber decline and forecast further declines. The stock fell about 35% on April 20, 2022.\n\nThe complaint asserts two causes of action: (1) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants for alleged material misstatements/omissions and a fraudulent scheme; and (2) Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Individual Defendants predicated on the alleged primary violation by Netflix and the executives’ control over Netflix’s public statements and SEC filings.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 (against all Defendants)",
          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity and scienter must be pled with particularity, and the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that each defendant acted with the required state of mind.\n\n1) Material misrepresentation/omission.\n\n(a) Actionable statements (sufficiently pled). The complaint plausibly pleads falsity and materiality as to a core set of statements about market penetration/headroom and the causes of slowing acquisition.\n\nFirst, the repeated “~60% UCAN penetration” statements (e.g., January 19, 2021 earnings call; March 8, 2022 conference) are pled as concrete, quantitative assertions about the degree of penetration in Netflix’s most important market. Plaintiff alleges that Netflix itself later disclosed that UCAN had “over 30m” additional sharing households on top of ~75m paying households, and that sharing as a percentage of paying membership “hasn’t changed much over the years.” Taking those allegations as true at the pleading stage, the complaint plausibly alleges that Netflix’s public “penetration” figure omitted a known and very large category of households already consuming Netflix (non-paying sharers) and thereby conveyed a materially misleading picture of how much incremental subscriber growth remained in UCAN.\n\nSecond, statements assuring “a lot of headroom,” “ample runway,” “no structural change,” and attributing weak acquisition primarily to “COVID pull-forward,” “choppiness,” and macro factors are plausibly alleged to be misleading when coupled with the alleged undisclosed fact that Netflix had extensive internal data showing account sharing materially increased effective penetration and was inhibiting acquisition growth. The April 19, 2022 disclosure—“high household penetration—when including … sharing—combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds,” and that COVID “obscured” the issue—supports a plausible inference that saturation from sharing was a known alternative explanation that rendered prior categorical denials of structural change potentially misleading.\n\nThird, the complaint plausibly pleads that certain risk-factor statements about account sharing in the 2020 and 2021 Forms 10-K (and related 10-Q language) could be misleading to the extent they presented account sharing as a hypothetical risk (“if … abused” / “if … efforts … are ineffective”) while allegedly omitting that multi-household sharing was already pervasive at the alleged scale and already hindering growth. Risk disclosures can be actionable when they warn of a risk as merely potential when the risk has already materialized.\n\n(b) Non-actionable statements (dismissed). Other categories of statements are not actionable as pled.\n\n• Puffery/immaterial optimism. Generalized statements such as “the business remains healthy,” “fundamentals … pretty solid,” “optimistic about long-term growth,” and similar corporate optimism are, in substantial part, non-actionable puffery absent specific, verifiable content. While plaintiff ties these statements to alleged undisclosed sharing data, many are too vague to be material misrepresentations.\n\n• Metrics-inflation theory (engagement/churn). The complaint alleges that engagement was “artificially inflated” and churn “artificially suppressed” by account sharing. But it does not identify a specific false numerical engagement or churn figure that Netflix reported (as opposed to qualitative characterizations), nor does it plead with particularity what Netflix’s reported engagement/churn was, what it would have been absent sharing, and why Netflix’s descriptions were false rather than merely incomplete. At most, the allegations suggest that account sharing is a confounding factor in interpreting engagement and retention; that does not, without more particularized pleading, convert general statements about engagement/retention into actionable misrepresentations.\n\nAccordingly, the Section 10(b) claim is sustained only to the extent it is predicated on (i) the UCAN penetration/headroom/runway representations and (ii) statements and risk disclosures that plausibly misattributed slowing acquisition primarily to COVID/macro factors while omitting the alleged known impact of account sharing on effective penetration and growth.\n\n2) Scienter.\n\nThe PSLRA requires a “strong inference” of scienter that is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\nAs to Netflix and the Individual Defendants, the complaint pleads scienter adequately for the surviving misstatement categories. The alleged subject matter—subscriber growth, penetration, and account sharing—goes to Netflix’s core operations and key performance indicators. The complaint alleges that Netflix monitored account sharing for years, reportedly used credential-sharing analytics, and internally discussed password sharing as “lost revenue” and a limiter on subscriber goals. It further alleges that Netflix began testing monetization/crackdown approaches “early last year” (i.e., early 2021) and that Peters stated on April 19, 2022 that Netflix had been working on this “a little bit over a year,” supporting an inference that management understood account sharing’s scale and its relationship to growth during the Class Period. The later disclosure that sharing levels “hasn’t changed much over the years” supports the inference that the relevant information existed throughout the Class Period.\n\nThe competing non-fraudulent inference—that Netflix reasonably viewed “penetration” as referring to paying households only and that the timing and magnitude of sharing estimates were uncertain—does not defeat scienter at this stage because plaintiff alleges (i) Netflix had internal data quantifying sharing, (ii) executives were asked directly about saturation and account sharing and responded with categorical denials of structural issues, and (iii) Netflix later characterized the issue as a key factor that COVID had “obscured,” suggesting it was knowable and material.\n\nScienter is not adequately pled, however, to the extent the claim rests on the more generalized “healthy fundamentals” puffery or the metrics-inflation theory, for which the complaint does not plead with particularity what was known, when, and how the challenged statements were false.\n\n3) Reliance.\n\nAt the pleading stage, plaintiff adequately invokes the Basic fraud-on-the-market presumption for Netflix’s NASDAQ-traded common stock, alleging an efficient market and public dissemination. To the extent the case involves options trading, reliance and classwide proof may present additional issues at class certification, but they do not warrant dismissal on the pleadings here.\n\n4) Loss causation.\n\nPlaintiff adequately pleads loss causation as to the surviving theory. The complaint identifies two price drops tied to disclosures about slowing acquisition and, later, the extent of account sharing and high household penetration. The April 19, 2022 disclosure is plausibly pled as a corrective disclosure of previously concealed information (the scale of sharing and its impact on penetration and growth). The January 20, 2022 event is plausibly pled as a partial materialization/corrective event concerning acquisition weakness; whether and to what extent that decline is attributable to the alleged fraud versus other disclosed factors is a loss-causation merits question not resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n\n5) Scheme liability.\n\nTo the extent plaintiff pleads a “scheme” under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), the claim survives only insofar as it is coextensive with the adequately pled misstatement/omission theory and not an impermissible attempt to repackage misstatement claims without additional deceptive conduct.\n\nDisposition. The motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed to the extent it is based on non-actionable puffery and the inadequately pled engagement/churn inflation theory, and otherwise sustained as described above."

          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a claim under Section 20(a), plaintiff must plead: (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person; and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. Many courts also require culpable participation, though the precise requirement varies by circuit; at the pleading stage, allegations of control coupled with a plausible primary violation generally suffice.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is sustained in part against Netflix (and, in part, against the Individual Defendants as speakers/signatories), the complaint adequately pleads a predicate primary violation.\n\nControl. The complaint alleges that Hastings, Sarandos, Neumann, and Peters were top executives with authority over Netflix’s public statements and SEC filings; that certain filings were signed by Hastings, Sarandos, and Neumann; and that they participated in earnings calls and investor conferences where the challenged statements were made. These allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage to plead control.\n\nCulpable participation/defenses. To the extent culpable participation is required, the same allegations supporting scienter for the surviving Section 10(b) theory—core-operations nature of subscriber/penetration metrics, alleged internal tracking and testing to monetize sharing during the Class Period, and later admissions about the role of sharing and unchanged sharing percentages—plausibly support culpable participation.\n\nDisposition. The motion to dismiss the Section 20(a) claim is denied. The claim may proceed to the extent it is predicated on the surviving portions of the Section 10(b) claim."

      "summary": "This consolidated securities class action is brought by lead plaintiffs Martin Dugan, Leon Yu, and Max Wisdom Technology Limited on behalf of two overlapping proposed classes: (1) a Securities Act class of purchasers of Talis Biomedical Corporation (“Talis”) common stock pursuant and/or traceable to Talis’s February 11, 2021 initial public offering (“IPO”) Registration Statement; and (2) an Exchange Act class of purchasers of Talis common stock on the open market between March 30, 2021 and March 15, 2022 (inclusive).\n\nDefendants fall into two groups. For the Securities Act claims, defendants are Talis (issuer) and the Individual Defendants who signed the Registration Statement: CEO/co-founder Brian Coe, CFO J. Roger Moody, and directors Felix Baker, Raymond Cheong, Melissa Gilliam, co-founder/director Rustem Ismagilov, director/Chair Kimberly Popovits, and directors Matthew Posard and Randal Scott. For the Exchange Act claims, defendants are Talis and three officer defendants: Coe, Moody, and Robert Kelley (Chief Commercial Officer during much of the period and CEO from December 2021).\n\nThe complaint centers on alleged misstatements and omissions concerning the development and commercialization readiness of the “Talis One,” a point-of-care molecular diagnostic platform that Talis pivoted to develop for COVID-19 testing in 2020. Plaintiffs allege that, by the time of the IPO, Talis had no functioning commercial product and no viable near-term path to commercialization, but nevertheless marketed the IPO with statements portraying the device as highly accurate, regulatory-ready, and capable of being manufactured at scale.\n\nKey alleged misconduct and supporting facts:\n\n1) FDA EUA submission/comparator assay problems. Talis submitted an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) application to the FDA on January 29, 2021. Plaintiffs allege that the submission was “doomed from inception” because Talis used an insufficiently sensitive comparator assay (a benchmark test used to calculate PPA/NPA), contrary to FDA guidance requiring a “high sensitivity” comparator. Plaintiffs allege the Registration Statement touted detailed performance metrics (including high PPA/NPA and “FDA-authorized” comparators) while omitting that the comparator assay was inadequate and that the FDA had already requested additional information pre-IPO. Post-IPO, in late February 2021, the FDA informed Talis it could not ensure the comparator assay had sufficient sensitivity; Talis withdrew the EUA submission and disclosed this on March 8, 2021.\n\n2) Product design and reliability/high invalid rates. Plaintiffs allege that, before the IPO, the Talis One had serious design defects and high “invalid” test rates (tests yielding unusable results), known internally. The Registration Statement allegedly described the product as “highly accurate” and “reliable,” while framing defects and reliability issues as hypothetical risks rather than existing conditions.\n\n3) Manufacturing scale and instrument order representations. Plaintiffs allege that the Registration Statement falsely claimed Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” for delivery beginning Q4 2020 through Q1 2021 and that automated cartridge lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month would come online in Q1 2021 and scale to full capacity through 2021. According to plaintiffs, Talis had only ordered “components for up to 5,000 instruments” (revealed in the March 15, 2022 Form 10-K) and lacked any realistic ability to achieve the promised cartridge scale in 2021.\n\n4) Post-IPO Exchange Act statements. For the Exchange Act class period (March 30, 2021–March 15, 2022), plaintiffs challenge repeated statements in SEC filings and earnings calls asserting Talis was “on track,” “on plan,” “ready to go,” in “final stages of validation” of automated cartridge lines, and could ship promptly following EUA approval. Plaintiffs allege these statements were false because manufacturing was not validated, production was not scalable, and invalid rates remained unacceptably high.\n\nCorrective disclosures and stock-price declines alleged include: March 8, 2021 (withdrawal of first EUA submission); August 10, 2021 (admission of extended timelines); August 30, 2021 (Coe’s abrupt departure); November 15–16, 2021 (phased/limited rollout and delay); December 8, 2021 (new CEO Blaser’s abrupt departure after one week); and March 15, 2022 (no launch timeline; manufacturing insufficient; unacceptable invalid rates; external consultants; workforce reduction; disclosure that only components for up to 5,000 instruments were ordered).\n\nClaims asserted: (i) Section 11 of the Securities Act against Talis and the Individual Defendants (strict liability as to issuer; negligence as to signatories), (ii) Section 15 of the Securities Act against the Individual Defendants as control persons, (iii) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against Talis and the officer defendants for the Exchange Act class period, and (iv) Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the officer defendants as control persons.\n\nSignificant dates: October 15, 2020 (draft S-1 filed); January 29, 2021 (first EUA submission); February 11, 2021 (IPO pricing/effectiveness); February 12, 2021 (trading begins); March 8, 2021 (withdrawal disclosure); March 30, 2021 (start of Exchange Act class period; 2020 Form 10-K); August 10, 2021 (timeline delay admission); August 30, 2021 (Coe steps down); November 8, 2021 (EUA obtained for second submission); December 1/8, 2021 (Blaser becomes CEO then departs); March 15, 2022 (end of Exchange Act class period; major negative disclosures).",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a Section 11 claim, plaintiffs must allege that the registration statement, when it became effective, contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading. Scienter, reliance, and loss causation are not elements (though defendants may raise negative causation as an affirmative defense). Claims sounding in fraud must satisfy Rule 9(b), but plaintiffs expressly disclaim fraud as to the Securities Act counts and plead negligence/strict liability.\n\nApplication. The complaint plausibly alleges multiple actionable misstatements/omissions in the IPO Registration Statement.\n\n(1) Comparator assay / EUA submission. Plaintiffs allege that Talis chose to speak in detail about PPA/NPA, limits of detection, and use of “FDA-authorized” comparators, and also disclosed that FDA requested “additional information” during preliminary review. Having spoken, Talis had a duty not to omit material facts necessary to make those statements not misleading. The alleged omission—that the comparator assay used for the EUA submission lacked sufficient sensitivity under FDA guidance and thus undermined the reliability of the touted agreement metrics—plausibly renders the described test-performance narrative misleading. Materiality is plausibly alleged because FDA authorization and test accuracy were central to valuation for a development-stage diagnostics company trying to monetize COVID testing in a time-sensitive market.\n\n(2) Manufacturing scale and “5,000 instruments.” Plaintiffs plausibly plead falsity as to the statement that Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” for near-term delivery, based on later admissions that it had ordered only “components for up to 5,000 instruments,” and that delivery timing differed. At the pleading stage, that is sufficient to allege a materially false statement of present fact. Likewise, statements that automated cartridge lines were scheduled to come online in Q1 2021 and scale to full capacity (one million/month) through 2021 are plausibly misleading if, as alleged, Talis lacked a realistic ability to achieve that capacity and was already materially behind internal deadlines.\n\n(3) Reliability/invalid rates. The Registration Statement’s affirmative statements describing the platform as designed for “highly accurate” and “reliable results,” coupled with risk-factor language framing defects and reliability issues as potential future risks, are plausibly misleading if Talis already faced known high invalid rates and significant design problems. Risk disclosures are not a safe harbor for failing to disclose that the risk has already materialized.\n\nRule 8/9(b). The Securities Act allegations are pleaded with sufficient particularity even under Rule 9(b) standards: they identify the challenged statements, the alleged contemporaneous contrary facts, and the basis for those facts (including FDA events and later company disclosures). Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Section 11."

The complaint plausibly alleges control by the Individual Defendants based on their roles as CEO/CFO and directors who signed the Registration Statement and allegedly had power to influence its contents and the offering. Signature and board/officer status, together with allegations of authority over disclosures and the offering process, suffice at this stage. Any “no knowledge” defense is fact-intensive and not resolved on a motion to dismiss. The motion is denied as to Section 15."

          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must plead: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness); (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity and scienter must be pleaded with particularity, and scienter must be supported by facts giving rise to a strong inference that is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\nMaterial misstatements/omissions. Plaintiffs identify specific statements in SEC filings and earnings calls during the Exchange Act class period: repeated assertions that automated cartridge lines would scale to meet demand through 2021 and reach one million/month capacity; that the company was “on track” and “ready to go” to ship promptly after EUA; that cartridge lines were in the “final stages of validation”; that “results really look terrific” and Talis was “way ahead” in ability to produce product; and that Talis had ordered “5,000 instruments.” Plaintiffs plead contemporaneous contrary facts: internal missed deadlines, inability to scale, lack of validated production lines, high invalid rates, and later admissions that only components were ordered. At the pleading stage, these allegations plausibly establish falsity and materiality because they go to the core question for investors: whether Talis could commercialize and manufacture its only product.\n\nScienter. The complaint pleads a strong inference of scienter as to the officer defendants and corporate scienter as to Talis. It relies on multiple confidential former-employee accounts describing known manufacturing failures, unrealistic timelines, and high invalid rates; allegations that Coe was directly briefed in May 2021 about manufacturing timeline problems; allegations that supply-chain issues were raised to personnel reporting to CFO Moody; and the centrality of the Talis One to the company. It further alleges contemporaneous documentary/structural facts supporting access to contrary information: the NIH RADx contract’s milestone and reporting requirements concerning manufacturing and production rates; the thinXXS supply agreement’s forecasting and volume-commitment structure; and the FDA’s requirement to track and report invalid rates post-EUA. The alleged repeated and specific reassurances about manufacturing readiness and “validation,” juxtaposed with later admissions that the company was only “beginning to evaluate” cartridge performance months later and still could not commercialize due to manufacturing yield/consistency and unacceptable invalid rates, support an inference of at least deliberate recklessness.\n\nDefendants’ alternative inference—that these were good-faith but overly optimistic projections typical of a development-stage company—does not defeat the claim at this stage because plaintiffs allege not merely failed predictions, but misstatements of then-existing conditions (e.g., “final stages of validation,” “ordered 5,000 instruments,” readiness to ship promptly) and omission of known problems already undermining those claims.\n\nReliance. Plaintiffs plead market efficiency and invoke Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption, which is sufficient at the pleading stage.\n\nLoss causation. Plaintiffs plead a series of partially corrective disclosures and materialization of concealed risks (August 2021 delay admission; leadership departures; November 2021 phased rollout delay; March 15, 2022 disclosure of unacceptable invalid rates, manufacturing insufficiency, no timeline, external consultants, and correction re “components” vs. “instruments”), along with associated stock declines. That plausibly pleads loss causation.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim."

Because the Section 10(b) claim survives, the complaint pleads a primary violation by Talis.

These allegations plausibly plead control. Any good-faith defense is not resolved on a motion to dismiss. The motion is denied as to Section 20(a)."

      "summary": "This putative securities-fraud class action is brought by court-appointed Lead Plaintiff Sjunde AP-Fonden (“AP7”) on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Lucid Group, Inc. (“Lucid”) common stock between November 15, 2021 and August 3, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were damaged thereby. Defendants are: (1) Lucid (a Delaware corporation headquartered in Newark, California, trading on Nasdaq as “LCID”), and (2) two individual officers—Peter Rawlinson (CEO/CTO) and Sherry House (CFO) (together, the “Individual Defendants”).\n\nThe complaint alleges a scheme to mislead investors about Lucid’s ability to ramp production of its only commercially available vehicle, the Lucid Air, and about the real reasons production was falling short. According to the complaint, Lucid’s business success depended on mass production and delivery of the Air; investors and analysts were “laser-focused” on production guidance, and Lucid repeatedly touted aggressive production targets (notably 20,000 vehicles in 2022) in connection with and after its July 2021 SPAC merger that took the company public.\n\nThe alleged fraudulent conduct centers on Defendants’ repeated public statements during the Class Period that Lucid remained confident it could meet (i) 20,000 vehicles in 2022, then (ii) after a February 28, 2022 cut, 12,000–14,000 vehicles in 2022—while allegedly concealing that Lucid was suffering from severe, pervasive, Lucid-specific internal logistics and production problems that made those targets unattainable. The complaint alleges Defendants instead attributed the production shortfalls primarily to external, industry-wide supply chain and logistics disruptions, and assured investors Lucid was mitigating those issues. Plaintiffs allege this created a materially misleading impression that Lucid was internally ready and able to scale, constrained mainly by transient external factors.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity and omission include extensive accounts from former employees and contractors describing: (1) dysfunctional inventory and warehouse-management systems (failed SAP implementations; reliance on inaccurate third-party systems and manual spreadsheets; inability to locate parts; inaccurate counts); (2) a warehouse operating far above capacity (parts stacked unsafely, aisles blocked, parts crushed/damaged); (3) inability to get parts to the Arizona manufacturing plant in time, leading to frequent “hot calls” and repeated line shutdowns; (4) reflashing/sequencing/quality-check failures that caused parts to be rejected or unusable; (5) significant scrapping of parts (including alleged management awareness and approvals); and (6) design/manufacturability problems causing supplier inability to meet specifications, last-minute design changes, and rework.\n\nScienter allegations include that Rawlinson and senior management allegedly knew before the Class Period that the 20,000 target was unattainable. A key allegation is that in October 2021 or early November 2021 Rawlinson told a small group of employees Lucid would produce fewer than 10,000 vehicles in 2022 and instructed confidentiality. The complaint also alleges Rawlinson regularly visited the warehouse and plant, received internal reports, and took steps to “band-aid” logistics issues—supporting an inference he knew the problems were severe and ongoing. As to motive, the complaint alleges Rawlinson’s compensation included large performance-based RSUs tied to market-cap milestones, and Lucid also conducted a December 2021 convertible notes offering raising approximately $2.0 billion when the stock was allegedly inflated.\n\nThe complaint pleads two partial corrective disclosures: (1) February 28, 2022—Lucid cut 2022 production guidance from 20,000 to 12,000–14,000, and the stock fell about 13% (from $28.98 to $24.99). Plaintiffs allege this was only a partial revelation because Defendants still blamed external supply chain issues and concealed the internal logistics dysfunction; and (2) August 3, 2022—Lucid again cut guidance to 6,000–7,000 and disclosed that internal logistics-process immaturity and inability to get the right parts to the line were “primary bottlenecks,” with the stock falling about 9.7% (from $20.56 to $18.56).\n\nThe legal claims asserted are: (Count I) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants, based on alleged material misrepresentations and omissions regarding production guidance and the causes of production constraints; and (Count II) Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Individual Defendants based on the alleged primary violation.\n\nSignificant dates: Feb. 22, 2021 (SPAC merger announced); July 23, 2021 (merger closed); July 26, 2021 (LCID begins trading); Sept. 28, 2021 (Lucid announces start of production); Oct. 30, 2021 (first deliveries); Nov. 15, 2021 (start of Class Period; first public-company quarterly results; reaffirmed 20,000 guidance); Dec. 8, 2021 (convertible notes offering announced); Feb. 28, 2022 (guidance cut to 12,000–14,000); May 5, 2022 (reaffirmed 12,000–14,000); Aug. 3, 2022 (end of Class Period; guidance cut to 6,000–7,000; internal logistics disclosed).",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007). Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity must be pleaded with particularity, and scienter must be pleaded with particularity giving rise to a “strong inference” that is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission (PSLRA). The complaint identifies specific statements during the Class Period, including: (a) November 15, 2021 press release and earnings call (confidence in achieving 20,000 units in 2022; risks framed as industrywide supply chain/logistics, mitigated); (b) November 16, 2021 CNBC interview (factory “ready for 34,000 units per annum,” and supply-chain issues framed as industrywide with mitigation plans); (c) February 14, 2022 Arizona legislature remarks (20,000 units; Lucid in “enviable position” vs larger OEMs; capacity to fill orders); (d) February 28, 2022 guidance cut to 12,000–14,000, framed as extraordinary supply chain/logistics challenges and quality focus; (e) May 5, 2022 reaffirmation of 12,000–14,000, again conditioned on supply chain/logistics disruptions and mitigation plans; and (f) other similar statements through May 2022.\n\nAt the pleading stage, plaintiffs adequately allege falsity in two interrelated ways: (i) the production guidance itself allegedly lacked a reasonable basis because Defendants allegedly knew internally that production would be under 10,000 for 2022; and (ii) Defendants allegedly misled investors by attributing the primary constraints to external, industrywide supply-chain/logistics issues while omitting severe Lucid-specific internal logistics/inventory/warehouse dysfunction and design/manufacturability problems that were allegedly already materially impairing production.\n\nStatements of production “guidance” can be actionable where plaintiffs plead particularized facts showing the speaker lacked a reasonable basis or did not genuinely believe the projection when made. Here, the complaint pleads, with detail, that Rawlinson allegedly told employees in October/early November 2021 that Lucid would produce fewer than 10,000 vehicles in 2022 and instructed confidentiality; multiple former employees allegedly corroborate broad internal understanding that targets would be missed; and the complaint provides extensive factual allegations (inventory-system failures, overcapacity, inability to locate parts, hot calls, line shutdowns, scrapping, and design issues) that plausibly support why the guidance could be unattainable.\n\nAdditionally, once Defendants chose to speak about the reasons for production constraints—repeatedly emphasizing industrywide supply chain disruptions and mitigation—they assumed a duty to speak fully and not misleadingly. At the pleading stage, the alleged omission of severe internal logistics dysfunction is plausibly material because production capacity and ramp feasibility were central valuation drivers, and the complaint plausibly alleges the market reacted to production guidance and explanations.\n\nDefendants’ likely arguments that some statements are puffery (e.g., “progress,” “confident,” “mitigation plans,” “quality focus”) do not warrant dismissal of the claim as a whole because the complaint also targets concrete, verifiable guidance numbers and specific causal explanations about what was constraining production. Similarly, the PSLRA safe harbor does not require dismissal at this stage because plaintiffs plead particularized facts supporting actual knowledge of falsity as to forward-looking guidance (including the alleged internal <10,000 admission and contemporaneous operational facts), and many challenged statements are mixed present/future statements (e.g., describing current bottlenecks, current readiness, current mitigation).\n\n2. Scienter (Tellabs; PSLRA). Plaintiffs plead a strong inference of scienter as to Rawlinson. The complaint alleges: (a) an internal admission by Rawlinson in October/early November 2021 that 2022 production would be <10,000 and instruction to keep it confidential; (b) repeated, detailed warnings to Rawlinson about warehouse dysfunction and inability to get parts to the line; (c) Rawlinson’s frequent visits to the warehouse and plant and receipt of internal reports; and (d) repeated public reaffirmations of higher guidance notwithstanding those alleged facts.\n\nAs to House, the complaint pleads scienter adequately at the motion-to-dismiss stage. It alleges House signed key SEC filings/press releases containing the guidance and explanations; attended or was involved in meetings about inventory-control problems; denied or was involved in denials of full physical inventory requests allegedly for “books” reasons; and received requests to approve scrapping material. While the inference of House’s scienter may be weaker than Rawlinson’s, Tellabs requires a holistic assessment. Given the centrality of production guidance to Lucid’s business, the repeated nature of the statements, her role as CFO signing the challenged disclosures, and the pleaded allegations that she was informed of inventory/logistics dysfunction, plaintiffs plead at least deliberate recklessness sufficient at this stage.\n\nLucid’s scienter is adequately pleaded through the alleged scienter of its senior officers and the detailed allegations that information about production constraints and warehouse dysfunction was known and communicated within management.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead reliance via the fraud-on-the-market presumption (Basic Inc. v. Levinson) based on an efficient market for Nasdaq-traded LCID and analyst coverage, and alternatively via Affiliated Ute for omissions. At the pleading stage, that suffices.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead two alleged corrective disclosures/partial revelations: February 28, 2022 (guidance cut to 12,000–14,000; stock drop ~13%) and August 3, 2022 (guidance cut to 6,000–7,000 and disclosure that internal logistics immaturity was a primary bottleneck; stock drop ~9.7%). These allegations plausibly connect the revelation of the concealed risk/true state of production constraints to price declines. Whether other market forces contributed is a merits question not resolved on a motion to dismiss where plaintiffs plausibly plead a causal link.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

          "claim": "Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability) (against Rawlinson and House)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead Section 20(a) control-person liability, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a primary violation of the federal securities laws by the controlled person; and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. Many courts also require culpable participation, though the precise formulation varies by circuit; at the pleading stage, allegations of control plus participation in the challenged statements typically suffice.\n\n1. Primary violation. Because the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim is adequately pleaded and survives, the first element is satisfied.\n\n2. Control. The complaint pleads that Rawlinson was CEO/CTO and House was CFO during the Class Period; both allegedly had authority over Lucid’s public statements, participated in earnings calls, and House signed key SEC filings/Forms 8-K. Those allegations plausibly establish control at the pleading stage.\n\n3. Culpable participation/role. Plaintiffs further allege each Individual Defendant’s direct involvement in the challenged disclosures and access to information about production constraints. That is sufficient to plead Section 20(a) at this stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

      "summary": "This putative securities-fraud class action is brought by court-appointed Lead Plaintiff New England Teamsters Pension Fund on behalf of purchasers of Cutera, Inc. (“Cutera” or “CUTR”) common stock during March 1, 2022 through March 21, 2024 (the “Class Period”). Defendants are Cutera and seven current/former senior executives: former CEO David Mowry; former CFO Rohan Seth; former Executive Chairman/Chairman J. Daniel Plants; former Interim CEO Sheila Hopkins; current CEO Taylor Harris; current CFO/Interim CFO Stuart Drummond; and former SVP/General Counsel Vikram Varma.\n\nThe complaint alleges a company-wide fraud centered on (1) undisclosed, pervasive failures of inventory management and internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), and (2) a rushed and ultimately unsuccessful rollout of Cutera’s acne laser device “AviClear,” which allegedly exacerbated inventory and operational chaos and harmed Cutera’s core business (“Core Capital”). Plaintiffs contend defendants repeatedly told investors the opposite: that internal controls were effective or being remediated, that AviClear’s launch and demand were strong, and that Cutera’s core business remained healthy.\n\nKey factual allegations include:\n\n• Inventory/ERP/internal controls failures: Cutera allegedly lacked adequate inventory controls and had a botched implementation of SAP/ERP and Salesforce beginning in early 2022, with inadequate training and oversight. Former employees (CWs) describe discrepancies between system-record inventory and physical inventory, lack of warehouse access controls, backorders, inability to fulfill parts/orders, and a January 2023 extended plant shutdown (additional ~3 weeks beyond the normal annual count) driven by audit/inventory-count issues. Plaintiffs allege these deficiencies caused Cutera to overstate inventory and understate cost of revenue, gross margin, and losses in 1Q and 2Q 2023.\n\n• AviClear rollout allegedly driven by executive compensation incentives: Plaintiffs allege an “AviClear Incentive Plan” (also referred to as the “Acne Equity Grant”) rewarded executives based on the number and speed of AviClear placements, not utilization. Plaintiffs allege this incentive caused defendants (especially Mowry and Plants) to push aggressive placements (including via a leasing/subscription model and giving devices away/bundling), divert sales/manufacturing resources from Core Capital, and rush product readiness, resulting in reliability issues, customer dissatisfaction, and returns.\n\n• Misstatements/omissions: Throughout the Class Period, defendants allegedly made materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings, earnings calls, and press releases concerning (a) the effectiveness/remediation of internal controls and inventory management; (b) the success, demand, adoption, and utilization of AviClear; and (c) the health of Core Capital. The complaint emphasizes SOX certifications signed by various CEO/CFO combinations and alleges those certifications were false given the later restatement and disclosed material weaknesses.\n\n• Corrective disclosures / significant dates:\n  - April 2022: limited commercial launch of AviClear; March 2022 FDA clearance referenced.\n  - Jan. 9, 2023: preliminary 2022 revenue below expectations, attributed in part to sales focus on AviClear; stock fell >23%.\n  - Mar. 16, 2023: disclosure of inability to timely file 2022 Form 10-K and material weaknesses (including inventory count controls); stock fell ~12.5%.\n  - Apr. 11–12, 2023: Mowry and Plants terminated “with cause,” outlook withdrawn; stock fell >28%.\n  - May 9, 2023: poor 1Q 2023 results; disclosure of extended plant shutdown; Seth resigned as CFO; stock fell ~30% over two sessions.\n  - Aug. 8–9, 2023: disclosure of reliability/service issues and declining AviClear utilization; stock fell ~22–25%.\n  - Nov. 8–9, 2023: disclosure of $8–$9M inventory shortfall vs. system of record, delay of 10-Q, and intent to restate 1Q/2Q 2023; stock fell ~42.6%.\n  - Mar. 5, 2024: issuance of restated 1Q/2Q 2023 financials (inventory overstatement; cost-of-revenue understatement) and disclosure of an additional material weakness in risk assessment; stock fell ~3.3%.\n  - Mar. 21–22, 2024: disclosure of excessive inventory (notably AviClear), large inventory reserves, and expected additional AviClear returns; stock fell >30% (and further next day). Plaintiffs allege this date fully revealed the fraud.\n\nLegal claims asserted:\n• First claim: Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5(b) against Cutera and all Individual Defendants, based on alleged material misstatements/omissions concerning internal controls/inventory, AviClear rollout success, and financial statements (including restated quarters).\n• Second claim: Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Individual Defendants, predicated on a primary Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 violation.\n\nThe complaint alleges reliance under the fraud-on-the-market presumption and pleads loss causation via the above series of partial corrective disclosures culminating on March 21, 2024.",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.; Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity must be pled with particularity, and scienter must be pled with facts giving rise to a strong inference that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission (falsity and materiality). The complaint pleads with sufficient particularity multiple categories of actionable statements.\n\n(a) Statements about internal controls and inventory/accounting. Plaintiffs identify specific SEC filings and SOX certifications in which CEO/CFO signatories represented that disclosure controls and ICFR were designed and effective to provide reasonable assurance of reliable GAAP reporting. The complaint then pleads concrete, later-disclosed facts: (i) an $8–$9 million inventory shortfall vs. the system of record revealed in November 2023; (ii) the March 2024 restatement of 1Q and 2Q 2023 financials correcting inventory overstatements and corresponding cost-of-revenue understatements; and (iii) disclosure of material weaknesses, including an additional material weakness in risk assessment.\n\nAt the pleading stage, a restatement and disclosure of material weaknesses do not automatically establish fraud, but they are strong, particularized factual support for falsity as to statements asserting accurate financials and effective controls during the affected periods. Here, plaintiffs also plead operational facts (botched ERP implementation, lack of training/oversight, physical access/control issues, parts backlogs, and an extended audit-driven shutdown) that plausibly connect the misstatements to contemporaneous conditions.\n\n(b) Statements touting AviClear “successful launch,” “growing adoption,” “strong demand,” and denials that customers stopped using AviClear. Some of these statements are potentially nonactionable puffery (e.g., generalized optimism), but several are pleaded as concrete factual assertions about adoption/demand and customer behavior (e.g., “AviClear has seen growing physician adoption and steadily increasing patient demand”; and Mowry’s categorical “No” to whether any customer stopped using AviClear). The complaint pleads contrary internal facts from multiple former employees: low utilization, customer dissatisfaction, attempted returns, and internal discussions of poor performance by mid-2022. At this stage, those allegations suffice to plead falsity and materiality.\n\n(c) Statements about Core Capital strength and resource allocation. Plaintiffs plead that defendants repeatedly represented Core Capital was strong and that the sales process was “aligned,” while internally directing the sales force to prioritize AviClear placements and thereby harming Core Capital sales. The complaint cites contemporaneous analyst reports reflecting management’s admissions that the sales force “took their eye off the ball” on the core business. These allegations plausibly support that the challenged statements were misleading by omission (failing to disclose the extent of diversion and its impact).\n\nMateriality is plausibly alleged because the challenged topics—ICFR/inventory accuracy, restated financial metrics, and the success of a “transformative” product line—are the sort of information a reasonable investor would consider important.\n\n2. Scienter. Plaintiffs plead a strong inference of at least deliberate recklessness. The complaint alleges: (i) repeated internal warnings and complaints reaching senior leadership (including direct customer complaints to the CEO); (ii) the centrality of inventory management and AviClear to Cutera’s operations; (iii) the magnitude and persistence of inventory discrepancies culminating in an $8–$9M shortfall and restatement; (iv) the extended plant shutdown tied to audit/inventory count issues; (v) executive compensation incentives tied to AviClear placements; and (vi) abrupt leadership changes (Mowry and Plants terminated “with cause,” Seth resignation).\n\nWhile defendants may ultimately argue a nonculpable inference (poor execution, negligent controls, or accounting mistakes during a systems transition), at the motion-to-dismiss stage the pleaded facts, taken collectively, support an inference that is at least as compelling: senior executives allegedly knew of serious inventory/control breakdowns and AviClear performance issues while making affirmative public assurances and signing SOX certifications.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead an efficient market for CUTR (Nasdaq listing, analyst coverage, trading volume) and invoke Basic fraud-on-the-market reliance. That is sufficient at this stage.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead a series of stock drops tied to disclosures about revenue misses linked to AviClear, late filings and material weaknesses, executive terminations, plant shutdown and operational issues, the inventory shortfall and restatement, and later disclosures of excessive inventory (notably AviClear) and inventory reserves. Under Dura and Ninth Circuit pleading standards, plaintiffs need only plausibly allege that the revelation of the truth (or materialization of the concealed risk) caused the loss. The complaint does so with specific dates, content of disclosures, and price reactions.\n\n5. PSLRA safe harbor/puffery. To the extent some statements are forward-looking or vague corporate optimism, defendants may later narrow the actionable set. But the complaint also targets present-tense assertions about controls, adoption/demand, utilization, and the accuracy of financial statements, which are not immunized by the safe harbor. At the pleading stage, the presence of some nonactionable statements does not warrant dismissal of the entire claim.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5(b) claim."

Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is adequately pleaded, the complaint sufficiently alleges a primary violation by Cutera.\n\nControl. The complaint alleges each Individual Defendant’s senior officer/director role during the Class Period and their authority over SEC filings, earnings calls, press releases, and SOX certifications, including that several signed the challenged filings. Those allegations plausibly plead control at the pleading stage.\n\nGood faith. Good faith is an affirmative defense not typically resolved on a motion to dismiss unless it is apparent on the face of the complaint. It is not.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 20(a) claim."

      "summary": "This putative securities class action is brought by Lead Plaintiff Dr. Myo Thant and named plaintiff Branden Schenkhuizen on behalf of purchasers of Rain Oncology Inc. (f/k/a Rain Therapeutics Inc.) common stock. Plaintiffs allege that Rain and certain officers and directors misled investors about (i) the strength and implications of Phase 1 data for Rain’s lead drug candidate milademetan (an MDM2 inhibitor), (ii) the propriety and risk of skipping Phase 2 and proceeding directly to a pivotal Phase 3 trial (“Phase 2 Bypass”), and (iii) Rain’s clinical-stage status and its role in prior clinical trials.\n\nParties. Defendant Rain is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Newark, California, whose common stock traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “RAIN” during the class period. The “Individual Defendants” are Avanish Vellanki (Chairman and CEO) and Richard Bryce (EVP and Chief Medical Officer). The “Director Defendants” (Franklin Berger, Aaron Davis, Gorjan Hrustanovic, Tran Nguyen, Peter Radovich, and Stefani A. Wolff) served on Rain’s Board at the time of the April 2021 IPO and signed the registration statement.\n\nAlleged misconduct and theory. Plaintiffs’ core theory is that Rain’s IPO pitch and subsequent public disclosures touted milademetan as “de-risked” and supported by Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial data such that Rain could appropriately skip Phase 2 and rapidly commence a pivotal Phase 3 trial in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (the MANTRA trial). Plaintiffs allege this was misleading because Phase 2 Bypass is appropriate only in narrow circumstances when a drug’s mechanism of action and safety profile are well characterized; milademetan, as a first-in-human MDM2 inhibitor with known class hematologic toxicities, allegedly did not meet those criteria. Plaintiffs further allege Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial (U101) was intended to identify a “recommended Phase 2 dose,” and that the key efficacy data Rain highlighted (median PFS 7.4 months vs ~2.0–2.2 months SOC) came from only 16 patients on an intermittent 260 mg schedule—too small and insufficiently optimized to justify Phase 3 without Phase 2 dose refinement.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity/omissions. Plaintiffs allege: (1) Daiichi Sankyo’s U101 trial ran July 2013–October 2020; it initially contemplated dose escalation and dose expansion, but the expansion component was abandoned because effective dosing was not tolerable, prompting intermittent schedules; (2) the 260 mg intermittent schedule (days 1–3 and 15–17 of a 28-day cycle) was identified during the trial and administered to only 16 DDLPS patients; (3) Rain licensed milademetan in September 2020 and then represented in IPO materials and later SEC filings that the Phase 1 trial “validated” a dosing schedule that “mitigate[d] safety concerns” and supported commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial; (4) Rain repeatedly described itself as “late-stage” despite having just initiated its first company-sponsored trial in July 2021 and having no prior clinical trials conducted by Rain itself; (5) Rain’s SEC filings and presentations allegedly included “pipeline” graphics implying Rain conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 work, despite the Phase 1 being conducted by Daiichi Sankyo and Rain skipping Phase 2; and (6) Rain and executives allegedly used “best-in-class” language for milademetan despite SEC comments during the IPO process directing removal of such inferences.\n\nConfidential witness and SEC-comment allegations. Plaintiffs rely in part on a former employee (Senior Director, Program Management) who allegedly reported to Vellanki and states that Phase 2 is typically needed to “dial in” dosing in oncology; that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 did not dial in dosing; that the Phase 1 results were a “recommended Phase 2 dose” and not a Phase 3-ready dose; and that both Vellanki and Bryce understood these limitations. Plaintiffs also allege SEC comment letters during the IPO process admonished Rain to remove “late-stage” characterizations, revise pipeline tables to accurately source the Phase 1 trial to Daiichi Sankyo and remove planned trials, and remove “best-in-class/first-in-class” inferences; plaintiffs allege Rain resumed the challenged characterizations after the IPO.\n\nClass period and significant dates. The Exchange Act class period is April 23, 2021 through May 19, 2023 (inclusive). The IPO final prospectus was filed April 23, 2021 (offering price alleged $17/share; ~7.5 million shares; net proceeds alleged $121.9 million). Rain commenced the Phase 3 MANTRA trial on July 20, 2021. On September 20, 2021, Daiichi Sankyo published separate intimal sarcoma trial results at 260 mg showing high rates of hematologic toxicities; plaintiffs allege the stock declined from $15.88 (Sept. 17) to $13.21 (Sept. 20). On May 22, 2023, Rain announced MANTRA topline results: primary endpoint not met (median PFS 3.6 months vs 2.2 months; HR 0.89; p=0.53) and significant Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events; Rain announced it would not pursue further development in DDLPS; the stock fell from $9.93 (May 19) to $1.22 (May 22). Rain later suspended development and pursued strategic alternatives, culminating in a December 13, 2023 announcement of a tender offer acquisition by Pathos AI.\n\nClaims asserted. Plaintiffs assert: (1) Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against Rain, Vellanki, and Bryce based on alleged material misstatements/omissions and a fraudulent scheme concerning Phase 2 Bypass, dosing validation, “late-stage” status, pipeline depictions, and “best-in-class” claims; (2) Exchange Act Section 20(a) control-person claims against Vellanki and Bryce; (3) Securities Act Section 11 against Rain and the Director Defendants based on alleged material misstatements/omissions in the IPO registration statement/prospectus, including alleged Item 105 risk-factor deficiencies regarding the heightened risk from Phase 2 Bypass; and (4) Securities Act Section 15 control-person claims against the Director Defendants.",

          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness); (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity and scienter must be pleaded with particularity, and plaintiffs must plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Actionable misstatements/omissions—Phase 1 data “validated” dosing / supported Phase 2 Bypass. Plaintiffs plausibly plead falsity and materiality as to repeated statements (in the IPO prospectus and later SEC filings) that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial “validated” a dosing schedule that “mitigate[d] safety concerns” and that “[b]ased on these data” Rain could commence a pivotal Phase 3 trial. The complaint alleges concrete, contemporaneous facts: Daiichi Sankyo’s protocol objective was to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose; the intermittent 260 mg schedule was identified mid-trial; the key DDLPS efficacy data came from only 16 patients; and the Phase 1 dose-expansion component was abandoned due to tolerability issues. Taking those allegations as true at the pleading stage, a reasonable investor could view “validated” and “shown to mitigate safety concerns” as statements of present fact about the sufficiency/robustness of the Phase 1 dataset and dose optimization, not mere puffery. The alleged omission—that the Phase 1 result was expressly a “recommended Phase 2 dose” and that Daiichi Sankyo’s plan contemplated Phase 2 testing—also plausibly renders the affirmative “validated”/“based on these data” framing misleading.\n\nDefendants argue (as is typical in this genre of case) that disagreements about trial design, whether Phase 2 Bypass is appropriate, and how to interpret early data are nonactionable opinions. But under Omnicare principles, opinions can be actionable where plaintiffs plead that the speaker omitted material facts about the basis for the opinion that rendered it misleading to a reasonable investor. Here, plaintiffs plead that defendants presented the Phase 1 dataset as having de-risked and validated dosing for a pivotal trial while allegedly knowing the dataset was small, the dose was a Phase 2 recommendation, and tolerability/dose optimization remained unresolved. At this stage, those allegations suffice to plead a misleading half-truth.\n\n2. “Late-stage” company statements. Plaintiffs also plausibly plead that repeated descriptions of Rain as a “late-stage” precision oncology/biotechnology company were misleading in context. The complaint alleges Rain had not conducted clinical trials prior to July 2021 and was relying on a third-party Phase 1 trial. Whether “late-stage” is sometimes used colloquially in biotech is not dispositive; the SEC-comment allegations pleaded in the complaint support that the term carried a specific meaning in Rain’s offering context and that regulators viewed it as potentially misleading. At minimum, plaintiffs plausibly allege that calling Rain “late-stage” conveyed that Rain had a late-stage asset supported by adequate clinical development work and organizational experience in late-stage trials—an inference plaintiffs allege was false.\n\n3. Pipeline tables/graphics implying Rain conducted Phase 1/2. Plaintiffs plausibly plead falsity and materiality as to pipeline depictions in later 10-Qs/10-Ks and presentations that allegedly implied Rain conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 work, despite Daiichi Sankyo conducting Phase 1 and Rain skipping Phase 2. The SEC-comment allegations that the SEC required similar tables to be revised during the IPO process reinforce plausibility that such depictions could mislead reasonable investors about the maturity of the program and Rain’s role.\n\n4. “Best-in-class” statements. The complaint challenges statements that milademetan had the “potential to be” or was “best-in-class.” Much of this is classic, nonactionable corporate optimism and opinion not capable of objective verification, particularly where framed as “potential.” Absent specific allegations that defendants possessed contrary head-to-head data or a defined, objective benchmark showing the claim was false when made, these allegations do not plead falsity with the particularity required by the PSLRA. To the extent any “best-in-class” statement could be read as a concrete representation of proven superiority on safety/efficacy, the complaint does not identify contemporaneous data establishing that falsity.\n\nAccordingly, the motion is denied as to the Phase 2 Bypass/dose-validation and “late-stage”/pipeline-misrepresentation theories, and granted as to the “best-in-class” theory.\n\nScienter. Plaintiffs plead a strong inference of scienter as to the surviving theories. The complaint alleges: (i) repeated, consistent statements over time about validation and de-risking; (ii) the centrality of milademetan and the MANTRA trial to Rain’s business; (iii) SEC comment letters directed to Vellanki (copied to senior scientific leadership) warning about misleading “late-stage,” pipeline, and “best-in-class” inferences; (iv) a confidential witness alleging Vellanki and Bryce understood the Phase 1 dose was a recommended Phase 2 dose and that dose optimization remained unresolved; and (v) that Rain’s strategy was an aggressive “Phase 2 Bypass” adopted to save time and money. While defendants may ultimately offer nonfraudulent explanations (e.g., good-faith scientific judgment), at the pleading stage the inference that senior executives knowingly or recklessly overstated the sufficiency of Phase 1 data and minimized the heightened risk of skipping Phase 2 is at least as compelling as competing inferences.\n\nReliance, loss causation, and damages. Plaintiffs plead market efficiency and invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption; at this stage, that suffices. Loss causation is plausibly alleged through corrective disclosures/materialization of risk tied to (a) September 20, 2021 publication of high hematologic toxicity at the 260 mg dose in another study and (b) May 22, 2023 failure of MANTRA and disclosure of elevated Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events and lack of efficacy. The alleged price declines are temporally linked to these disclosures.\n\nResult. Count I is sustained as to alleged misstatements/omissions concerning (1) Phase 1 data “validating” dosing and supporting Phase 2 Bypass/mitigating safety concerns, (2) Rain’s “late-stage” characterization, and (3) pipeline depictions implying Rain conducted Phase 1/2. It is dismissed to the extent predicated solely on generalized “best-in-class” statements."

Many courts also consider culpable participation, but at the pleading stage in this Circuit, adequately alleging control plus a primary violation generally suffices; defendants may assert a good-faith defense.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Court sustains Count I in part against Rain (and also as to primary liability theories against the Individual Defendants), the complaint adequately pleads an underlying primary violation at this stage.\n\nControl. Plaintiffs allege Vellanki was CEO/Chairman and signed and SOX-certified multiple SEC filings containing the challenged statements, and Bryce was EVP/CMO and was quoted in press releases promoting the pivotal Phase 3 initiation and the program’s prospects.

Section 11 imposes liability for material misstatements or omissions in a registration statement on the issuer (strict liability) and on signatories/directors and other specified persons (subject to due diligence defenses). Plaintiffs must plead (1) a registration statement contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading; and (2) the plaintiff purchased shares traceable to the registration statement. Scienter, reliance, and loss causation are not elements (though negative causation may be a defense).\n\nMaterial misstatement/omission in the April 23, 2021 IPO prospectus/registration statement. Plaintiffs plausibly plead that the prospectus’s statements that the Phase 1 trial “validated” a dosing schedule that had been “shown to mitigate safety concerns” and that “[b]ased on these data” Rain anticipated commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial could be materially misleading for the same reasons discussed under Count I: the complaint alleges the Phase 1 outcome was a recommended Phase 2 dose based on a small subset, that tolerability/dose optimization remained unresolved, and that Daiichi Sankyo’s plan contemplated Phase 2 testing.\n\nItem 105 risk-factor theory. Plaintiffs also plausibly plead an omission theory under Item 105 of Regulation S-K: that Rain disclosed only generic clinical-trial risk (early results may not predict later results) while omitting the allegedly heightened, offering-specific risk created by its decision to bypass Phase 2 despite the asserted lack of a well-characterized safety profile and dose optimization. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs need only plausibly allege that the omitted risk was among the “most significant” factors making the offering speculative or risky and that the omission rendered the risk disclosures misleadingly incomplete.\n\nTraceability. Named plaintiff Schenkhuizen alleges he purchased shares pursuant to and/or traceable to the IPO registration statement. That suffices at this stage.\n\nResult.

      "summary": "This putative federal securities class action is brought by Lead Plaintiff and named plaintiff Ken Kula (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) on behalf of all persons and entities (excluding Defendants and related insiders) who purchased or otherwise acquired Fastly, Inc. (“Fastly” or the “Company”) securities during the class period November 15, 2023 through August 7, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Defendants are Fastly (a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California, whose common stock trades on the NYSE under ticker FSLY), its Chief Executive Officer Todd Nightingale, and its Chief Financial Officer Ronald Kisling (together, the “Individual Defendants”).\n\nFastly provides an edge cloud platform and content delivery network (“CDN”) services. The complaint alleges Fastly’s revenue is highly concentrated in existing enterprise customers and particularly its “top 10” large customers (often media/streaming accounts), with approximately 95% of revenue derived from customer usage of the platform and the top ten customers comprising roughly 37% of FY 2023 revenue. Plaintiffs allege that because Fastly’s business model depends heavily on usage-based revenue from large customers, reductions in traffic/usage, customer rerates (discount demands), and churn among enterprise customers would materially impair revenues.\n\nThe core alleged misconduct is that, beginning in November 2023 and continuing through at least August 7, 2024, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about: (1) the extent to which macroeconomic pressures (rising interest rates, budget tightening) were affecting Fastly’s business; (2) the stability of customer retention and the continued expansion/spend of existing enterprise customers (including top customers) on Fastly’s platform; (3) the causes of revenue weakness (attributing weakness to international traffic while allegedly omitting that multiple large customers were simultaneously “throttling down” usage); (4) the adequacy and progress of Fastly’s “engagement model” and efforts to stabilize/restore growth in key large accounts; and (5) Fastly’s strategic focus—publicly emphasizing expansion of existing customers while allegedly shifting sales incentives and strategy toward new-customer acquisition due to stagnation/declines in existing-customer growth.\n\nKey factual allegations are supported primarily by seven confidential witnesses (“CW1–CW7”), former employees in sales, account management, product/program management, and customer operations. The witnesses describe, among other things: (i) beginning in 2023, customers increasingly demanded steeper discounts at renewal and threatened to leave; (ii) enterprise customers cancelled or failed to renew (examples include Indeed and USAA); (iii) by late 2023, sales quota attainment deteriorated and new business “fell off a cliff”; (iv) Fastly management—including Nightingale—discussed at quarterly “all hands” meetings that large customers were “throttling down” traffic and that revenue from “big whales” was decreasing; (v) Fastly tracked customer throughput/traffic internally and discussed top-customer usage in regular meetings (including a red/yellow/green status system), with senior executives attending; (vi) in 2024 Fastly changed sales compensation to prioritize “new logos” over renewals/upsells, allegedly discouraging focus on existing-customer expansion; and (vii) Fastly had not timely delivered a requested “staging environment” product for major customers Apple and Amazon, allegedly undermining assertions of progress with major accounts.\n\nThe complaint identifies several significant dates and disclosures:\n\n• November 15, 2023: At an RBC conference, Nightingale stated macro pressures were largely confined to SMB/mid-market and that competitors were seeing slowing growth but “we’re not seeing that.” Plaintiffs allege this was misleading because macro pressures and discounting were already affecting Fastly, including large customers.\n\n• February 14, 2024 (after market): Fastly announced Q4 and FY 2023 results and provided FY 2024 revenue guidance of $580–$590 million. On the earnings call, Nightingale stated “customer retention efforts were stable” and denied fundamental changes beyond deal elongation; Kisling stated guidance assumed continued expansion of existing customers; Nightingale attributed weakness to international traffic. Plaintiffs allege these statements omitted/contradicted known declines in large-customer traffic and pricing pressure. February 15, 2024: stock fell from $23.54 to $16.34 (down 30.59%).\n\n• February 22, 2024: Fastly filed its FY 2023 Form 10-K, signed by Nightingale and Kisling with Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. Plaintiffs challenge statements that enterprise customers “continue to leverage our platform, increasing their spend” and risk-factor language describing reductions in usage or loss of major customers as hypothetical, despite alleged known ongoing declines.\n\n• May 1, 2024: Fastly issued Q1 2024 results and held an earnings call disclosing that the “biggest factor” in revenue pressure was reduced revenue from a small number of largest customers, increased rerates/discounts without commensurate traffic expansion, and volatility including reversal of vendor consolidation. Fastly cut FY 2024 revenue guidance to $555–$565 million. May 2, 2024: stock fell to $8.79 (down 32.02%). Plaintiffs characterize this as a corrective disclosure.\n\n• May 1, 2024: Fastly filed its Q1 2024 Form 10-Q, also signed and SOX-certified by Nightingale and Kisling. Plaintiffs challenge statements emphasizing focus on expanding existing-customer usage and risk factors still framed as hypothetical.\n\n• August 7, 2024: Fastly announced Q2 2024 results and held an earnings call disclosing continuing demand challenges and sequential revenue declines among some largest customers (primarily large media accounts), with top-10 revenue share falling to 34% from 38% in Q1, and further reduced FY 2024 guidance to $530–$540 million. August 8, 2024: stock fell to $5.86 (down 14.33%). Plaintiffs allege this was the “full truth” revealing ongoing large-customer declines and Fastly’s shift toward new customer acquisition to mitigate concentration risk.\n\nPlaintiffs assert two Exchange Act causes of action: (Count I) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants based on alleged material misstatements/omissions, scienter, reliance (fraud-on-the-market and/or Affiliated Ute), loss causation, and damages; and (Count II) Section 20(a) control-person liability against Nightingale and Kisling predicated on a primary violation by Fastly and their control of the Company’s public statements and SEC filings. The complaint also references Item 303 of Regulation S-K (MD&A known trends/uncertainties) as a basis for omissions, but does not plead a standalone statutory claim separate from the Section 10(b) theory.",
      "claim_rulings": [
        {
          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 (against all Defendants)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. At the pleading stage, Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA require Plaintiffs to plead with particularity the statements alleged to be false or misleading, why they are false, and facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation or omission. Plaintiffs identify specific statements, speakers, dates, and contexts, including: (a) the November 15, 2023 RBC conference statements minimizing macro headwinds and stating competitors saw slowing growth but Fastly was not seeing that; (b) February 14, 2024 earnings-call statements that retention was “stable,” that guidance assumed continued expansion of existing customers, and that weakness was attributable to international traffic and mere deal elongation; (c) February 22, 2024 10-K statements that enterprise customers were increasing spend and driving revenue growth, and risk factors describing loss/reduction of major customers and reduced usage as hypothetical; (d) May 1, 2024 10-Q statements emphasizing focus on expanding existing customers; and (e) May 1–2, 2024 earnings-call statements suggesting the new “engagement model” for top accounts was already producing progress.\n\nAt this stage, the complaint plausibly alleges falsity and misleading omission. The alleged “truth” is not merely that macro conditions existed or that customer behavior could change, but that (i) significant pricing pressure and discount demands were already occurring (beginning March/April 2023 and continuing), (ii) multiple large customers had already reduced traffic/usage (“throttled down”), and (iii) management knew by late 2023 that top-customer traffic and revenue were declining. The complaint supports those allegations with multiple confidential witnesses describing contemporaneous internal discussions at quarterly all-hands meetings, internal traffic monitoring tools, and weekly customer-ops throughput meetings. Those allegations, taken as true, plausibly render misleading statements that Fastly was not seeing macro headwinds, that retention and existing-customer expansion were stable, and that risks of major-customer pullbacks were merely hypothetical.\n\nDefendants’ likely arguments that certain statements are nonactionable puffery or opinion do not warrant dismissal on this record. Some statements (e.g., generalized optimism) may ultimately be inactionable, but Plaintiffs also plead concrete assertions about macro exposure (“we’re not seeing that”), retention stability, and the drivers of revenue weakness (attributing weakness to international traffic while allegedly omitting contemporaneous, known top-customer traffic declines). Those are the type of representations that can be material to investors in a usage-based, customer-concentrated business.\n\nSimilarly, risk-factor “hypotheticals” can be actionable where the complaint plausibly alleges the risk had already materialized and the disclosure therefore misleads by omission. Plaintiffs plead that large-customer usage declines were ongoing by late 2023 and that Defendants knew it, yet the 10-K and 10-Q framed reduction-in-usage/loss-of-major-customer risks as contingent. That is sufficient at the pleading stage.\n\n2. Scienter. Under the PSLRA, Plaintiffs must plead facts giving rise to a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness. Plaintiffs do so here. The complaint alleges: (a) repeated internal reporting and meetings addressing top-customer traffic/throughput, including quarterly all-hands where Nightingale allegedly discussed decreasing revenue from “big customers” and customers “throttling down”; (b) weekly customer-ops meetings tracking top-customer throughput with executive attendance and escalation (“tiger teams”) for persistently underperforming major accounts; (c) the centrality of top customers to Fastly’s revenue model (top ten ~37% of revenue; ~95% usage-based revenue), supporting a core-operations inference that senior executives would closely monitor top-customer traffic and rerates; (d) Kisling’s later admission that the problematic rerate/discount dynamics arose in late March/early April 2024, coupled with allegations that renewal negotiations begin months earlier, supporting an inference that management had visibility into significant pricing pressure when February 2024 guidance and “stable retention” statements were made; (e) alleged suspicious timing of discontinuing disclosure of DBNER and quarterly NRR beginning Q1 2024, which Plaintiffs allege would have highlighted weakening existing-customer expansion; and (f) alleged insider sales by Nightingale and Kisling during the Class Period.\n\nTaken together, these allegations support a strong inference of at least deliberate recklessness as to the truth of statements about macro headwinds, existing-customer expansion, and the stability/trajectory of large-customer usage. While Defendants may ultimately offer competing inferences (e.g., ordinary-course sales, good-faith optimism, or uncertainty in forecasting), the Court’s task at this stage is to determine whether the inference of scienter is “cogent and at least as compelling” as opposing inferences. On the pleaded facts—particularly the alleged internal discussions specifically about large customers throttling usage, and the later partial disclosures attributing guidance cuts to a small number of largest customers—the scienter inference is sufficiently strong.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead an efficient market for Fastly’s NYSE-traded stock and invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption. That is adequate at the motion-to-dismiss stage. To the extent Plaintiffs also rely on omissions, Affiliated Ute may apply, but Plaintiffs need not elect a single reliance theory now.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead price declines following alleged corrective disclosures on February 15, 2024 (Q4/FY 2023 results and market reaction), May 2, 2024 (guidance cut and disclosure that the biggest factor was reduced revenue from a small number of largest customers, rerates without traffic expansion, and volatility), and August 8, 2024 (continued declines among largest customers and further guidance cut). The May and August disclosures plausibly revealed the previously concealed risk that large customers were driving the revenue shortfall through reduced traffic and pricing pressure. At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs need only allege that the revelation of the truth was a substantial cause of the stock drop; they have done so.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count I is denied."

Those allegations plausibly establish control over the content and dissemination of the allegedly misleading statements.\n\nDefenses (good faith). Whether the Individual Defendants can establish a good-faith defense is a fact-intensive issue not resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss Count II is denied."

      "summary": "Plaintiffs (seven individuals residing in various U.S. states and Canada/UAE) allege they were short sellers of Vicor Corporation (“Vicor”) common stock in 2023 and were harmed by allegedly false and misleading statements made by Vicor and its CEO, Patrizio Vinciarelli.\n\nDefendants are (1) Vicor, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Massachusetts whose common stock trades on NASDAQ (VICR), and (2) Patrizio Vinciarelli, Vicor’s founder and long-time CEO/President, alleged to control Vicor’s governance through super-voting stock and to have signed Vicor’s periodic reports.\n\nThe alleged misconduct centers on statements made in connection with Vicor’s Q2 2023 earnings release and earnings call on July 25, 2023. Plaintiffs allege that Vicor, through Vinciarelli, represented that Vicor had an agreement with an “existing” and “significant” customer for Vicor’s next-generation “4G” lateral power distribution network (PDN) design, with deliveries expected to begin and “ramp” in Q4 2023. Plaintiffs contend the statements conveyed a concrete, near-term customer commitment that would reverse Vicor’s then-weak bookings/backlog trends. They allege the market understood the “existing” significant customer to be one of Vicor’s two major customers (Nvidia or Google). The complaint quotes the July 25 call where Vinciarelli said the customer was “an existing customer” and, when asked if it would be significant, responded: “This is a significant customer.”\n\nPlaintiffs allege the July 25 statements were false when made because “clearly no such customer existed,” or alternatively because Vicor lacked a reasonable basis to portray the arrangement as a concrete near-term ramp without disclosing that it was tentative or subject to reversal. They point to the alleged “cover up” as evidence of falsity and scienter: during Vicor’s Q3 earnings call on October 24, 2023, Vicor did not mention the previously touted customer/ramp, and when analysts asked for updates, Vicor executives allegedly dodged, refused to discuss “any one customer,” and suggested growth would come in the “medium to long term” via diversification away from the “two big guys.” Plaintiffs characterize these October 24 responses as effectively retracting or contradicting the July 25 message, without admitting that the supposed customer had backed out.\n\nPlaintiffs plead market reaction and loss: Vicor closed at $59 on July 25, 2023, then opened at $77.40 on July 26 and closed at $93.70 (intra-day high over $94), with trading volume spiking to over 4.5 million shares. Plaintiffs allege that due to the price spike and in reliance on the July 25 announcement and the market’s assimilation of it, they were forced to cover their short positions (including some derivatives), suffering substantial losses. They allege a corrective disclosure occurred on/after the October 24, 2023 call, after which Vicor’s stock fell sharply: Vicor closed at $53.19 on October 24, opened at $39.01 on October 25, and volume again approached 4.5 million shares.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that after litigation was filed, Vicor issued a September 3, 2024 press release “respond[ing] to allegations,” purportedly stating it had “booked” $30 million in “non-cancellable, non-returnable” orders reflecting what Vicor “understood to be” a customer allocation for a new program. Plaintiffs argue this post hoc explanation is inconsistent, was not timely disclosed, and supports an inference that the July 25 statements lacked a proper factual basis. Plaintiffs also allege motive and opportunity: Vinciarelli’s large equity stake and options, the effect of stock price increases on his net worth, prior insider sales in 2021, and alleged insider sales exceeding $1 million in the days after July 25, 2023.\n\nLegal claims: (1) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 (including 10b-5(b) misstatements/omissions and also scheme language) against Vicor and Vinciarelli; and (2) Section 20(a) control-person liability against Vinciarelli.\n\nClass period and key dates: Plaintiffs propose a class of persons who took short positions in Vicor stock prior to and on July 25, 2023 and covered their short positions in the days following and including October 24, 2023 (the “Class Period”). Significant dates include: May 1, 2023 (approximate start of plaintiffs’ shorting activity); July 25, 2023 (Q2 earnings release/call and alleged misstatements); July 26, 2023 (stock surge and alleged forced covering); October 24–25, 2023 (Q3 call and alleged corrective disclosure/price drop); and September 3, 2024 (post-suit Vicor press release).",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5",
          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private damages claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or deliberate recklessness); (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005). Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), plaintiffs must plead with particularity each allegedly false statement, why it was false or misleading when made, and must plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)-(2); Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007).\n\n1) Material misstatement/omission not adequately pleaded. The complaint quotes the July 25, 2023 earnings call and plausibly alleges the market took away that Vicor had a meaningful near-term customer ramp. But the pleading fails at the critical step required by the PSLRA: alleging particularized facts showing the statements were false when made.\n\nThe core falsity allegation is conclusory: “clearly no such customer existed.” The complaint does not identify any internal report, contemporaneous contract status, customer communication, witness account, or other concrete factual basis showing that, as of July 25, 2023, Vicor had no significant existing customer planning a Q4 ramp, or that Vicor’s statements about a ramp were knowingly untrue. The later October 24, 2023 call is pleaded as a “reversal,” but the transcript excerpts show primarily (i) a refusal to discuss customer-specific details and (ii) generalized discussion of diversification and longer-term opportunities. A later refusal to provide specificity, or a change in tone, does not itself establish that the earlier statements were false when made.\n\nNor does the complaint plead a clear “corrective disclosure” revealing the truth of the alleged falsity. The October call excerpts do not contain an admission that no customer existed, that the July statements were wrong, or that an identified Q4 ramp was cancelled. At most, the complaint alleges defendants did not repeat the earlier optimism and declined to discuss a particular customer. That is not enough to plead falsity with the specificity the PSLRA requires.\n\nThe complaint’s alternative theory—Vicor had only a tentative understanding and omitted risks/qualifications—also is not adequately pleaded as an actionable omission. Plaintiffs do not identify a specific omitted fact that rendered the July 25 statements misleading (e.g., that there were no purchase orders, that the customer had not committed, that Vicor lacked capacity, or that the customer had communicated uncertainty). The pleading instead infers tentativeness from the fact that the company later spoke differently. That is hindsight pleading.\n\n2) Scienter not strongly inferred. Even assuming arguendo the July 25 statements were misleading, the complaint does not plead facts giving rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with scienter.\n\nThe main scienter allegations are: (a) Vinciarelli’s position and access to information; (b) the importance of the customer to Vicor’s business; (c) the later October call’s evasiveness; (d) Vinciarelli’s equity stake and the stock-price impact on his net worth; and (e) allegations of insider sales by “certain Vicor insiders” after July 25.\n\nPosition/access and importance are insufficient on their own; the PSLRA requires particularized facts showing contemporaneous knowledge of falsity. The October call’s refusal to discuss customers is at least as consistent with a non-fraudulent inference (e.g., customer confidentiality, evolving program timing, or competitive sensitivity) as with fraud.\n\nMotive allegations are also weak as pleaded. Vinciarelli’s large holdings create a generalized desire for a higher stock price shared by most corporate executives and do not, without more, strongly imply fraudulent intent. The complaint does not allege Vinciarelli himself sold shares during the relevant period, and it does not plead the alleged other insiders’ sales with the specificity typically required (who sold, how many shares, when, under what plans, and why the sales were unusual in amount or timing). Without particularized, unusual insider trading allegations tied to the alleged fraud, these assertions do not create a strong inference of scienter.\n\n3) Reliance and the proposed “short-seller” class. Plaintiffs plead reliance in an atypical posture: they were short sellers who bought to cover after a price increase. While Section 10(b) can, in principle, apply to purchasers who cover short positions, the complaint’s reliance theory is not coherently pleaded under Basic.\n\nBasic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption is designed for purchasers (or sellers) who transacted at a market price allegedly distorted by defendants’ misstatements. Here, plaintiffs allege they were “forced” to cover because the price rose. That is not the same as alleging they relied on the integrity of the market price in deciding to buy; it suggests compelled risk management in response to price movement, which may be driven by many factors including short squeeze dynamics unrelated to the alleged misstatement. The complaint does not plead facts showing that each plaintiff’s decision to cover was caused by believing the July 25 statements, as opposed to margin requirements, risk limits, or other trading constraints.\n\nFurther, plaintiffs’ class definition is limited to persons who were short before July 25 and covered through October 24. That framing underscores that the alleged injury is not the classic inflationary overpayment injury but rather losses from covering into a price spike. The complaint does not adequately plead how Basic or Affiliated Ute presumptions apply to this class-wide theory, particularly where the alleged misrepresentation caused an increase (not decrease) and the class members’ relevant transactions are purchases to cover.\n\n4) Loss causation is not adequately pleaded. Loss causation requires a plausible allegation that the revelation of the truth concealed by the fraud caused the economic loss. Dura, 544 U.S. at 342-46.\n\nThe complaint identifies the October 24/25 price drop as the loss-causing event, but it does not plead a corrective disclosure that revealed the falsity of the July 25 statements. The October call excerpts show non-specific discussion and refusal to discuss customer details, not a disclosure that the July 25 “significant customer” statement was false. Absent a pleaded revelation of the truth (as opposed to disappointment, changed expectations, or general negative performance news), plaintiffs do not plausibly connect the later price decline to the alleged fraud.\n\nBecause plaintiffs do not plead falsity with PSLRA particularity, do not plead a strong inference of scienter, and do not adequately plead reliance and loss causation in this short-seller covering posture, the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed. Dismissal is without prejudice to amendment unless amendment would be futile; on this record, plaintiffs may attempt to plead particularized facts (e.g., contemporaneous documents, witness allegations, specific order/contract facts, and a true corrective disclosure) if they exist."

      "summary": "This is a Securities Act putative class action arising from Robinhood Markets, Inc.’s July 2021 initial public offering. Lead Plaintiffs Vinod Sodha and Amee Sodha allege they purchased Robinhood common stock issued pursuant and traceable to the IPO registration statement/prospectus and were damaged when the truth about Robinhood’s business trajectory and operational shortcomings emerged.\n\nParties. Plaintiffs sue (1) Robinhood Markets, Inc. (the issuer/registrant); (2) “Individual Defendants” consisting of senior executives and directors who signed the registration statement: CEO/President/co-founder Vladimir Tenev, CFO Jason Warnick, co-founder/Chief Creative Officer Baiju Bhatt, and directors Jan Hammer, Paula Loop, Jonathan Rubenstein, Scott Sandell, and Robert Zoellick; and (3) the IPO underwriters (Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Mizuho, JMP, KeyBanc, Piper Sandler, Rosenblatt, BMO, BTIG, Santander, Academy, Loop Capital, Ramirez, and Siebert).\n\nAlleged misconduct. Plaintiffs contend the IPO Offering Documents (Registration Statement declared effective July 28, 2021 and final Prospectus filed July 30, 2021) contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions. The core theory is that Robinhood marketed itself as executing a “democratize finance” strategy centered on safety/reliability, customer-centricity, responsive support, and long-term customer success, and simultaneously presented KPI and revenue information that purportedly conveyed ongoing massive growth through June 30, 2021. Plaintiffs allege those statements were misleading because (a) Robinhood allegedly was not following its stated “safety-first” and customer-first principles (e.g., insufficient fraud controls, inadequate customer support/training, and app design features that encouraged frequent trading and risky products), and (b) by June–July 2021 (immediately pre-IPO) Robinhood’s performance metrics and revenue were allegedly deteriorating sharply, contradicting the growth narrative.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity/omissions. Plaintiffs rely on confidential witnesses (former employees/contractors) and later-disclosed KPI data. They allege, among other things: (i) inadequate fraud detection and significant backlogs in fraud reviews; (ii) customer support infrastructure and training deficiencies; (iii) easy access to complex products (options/margin) for inexperienced customers; (iv) internal tracking of KPIs in real time (Looker dashboards) and discussion of declining MAU/attrition at all-hands/management meetings attended by Tenev and Bhatt; and (v) pre-IPO KPI deterioration in June and July 2021 including alleged declines in MAUs (from ~24.1M in May 2021 to 21.3M in June to 19.5M in July), crypto trading volume (from ~$127B in May to ~$30B in June to ~$13B in July), AUC deterioration (from ~$98.5B in May to ~$94.7B in July), stagnation in net cumulative funded accounts (~22.3–22.5M May–July), and declining ARPU (alleged to have fallen materially from Q1 2021 levels).\n\nPlaintiffs also plead that the Offering Documents’ risk disclosures (e.g., risks of outages, cybersecurity breaches, declining trading volumes/crypto volatility, and slowing growth) were misleading because the risks had allegedly already materialized by the time of the IPO. They further allege violations of SEC disclosure requirements, specifically Item 303 (known trends/uncertainties) and Item 105 (risk factors), based on the alleged known KPI/revenue deterioration and operational/customer-trust issues.\n\nClass definition and period. The proposed class consists of all persons/entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Robinhood common stock “issued in connection with the Company’s IPO,” i.e., shares purchased pursuant and traceable to the July 2021 offering (not a traditional Exchange Act “class period”). Significant dates: July 1, 2021 (draft S-1 filed); July 25, 2021 (final amendment filed); July 28, 2021 (Registration Statement effective); July 30, 2021 (IPO priced at $38 and final Prospectus filed). Plaintiffs allege partial corrective disclosures beginning October 26–27, 2021 (Q3 2021 results showing KPI/revenue declines), and continuing through later disclosures and reporting in 2021–2022, including November 2021 cybersecurity incident disclosure and April 28, 2022 reporting that included monthly KPI data allegedly revealing the pre-IPO declines.\n\nClaims asserted. Plaintiffs bring three Securities Act causes of action: (1) Section 11 against all defendants; (2) Section 12(a)(2) against all defendants; and (3) Section 15 control-person liability against the Individual Defendants predicated on the Section 11 claim. Plaintiffs expressly disclaim scienter/fraud and proceed on strict liability/negligence theories typical of Securities Act claims.",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a Section 11 claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege (1) it purchased securities issued pursuant and traceable to a registration statement, and (2) the registration statement contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Section 11 does not require scienter, reliance, or loss causation at the pleading stage (though damages/negative causation may be litigated later). Materiality is assessed under the substantial-likelihood/total-mix standard.\n\nApplication. Plaintiffs adequately plead traceability to the IPO offering and identify multiple categories of allegedly actionable misstatements/omissions in the Offering Documents. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court accepts as true well-pleaded allegations that, by June–July 2021, Robinhood’s key engagement and transaction metrics were declining sharply (MAU declines, crypto volume collapse, AUC deterioration, stagnating funded accounts, and falling ARPU), and that Robinhood tracked these metrics in real time and nonetheless presented IPO investors with KPI tables/estimates and narrative emphasizing continued growth and positioning for continued expansion.\n\nThe alleged omissions are plausibly material. Robinhood’s IPO materials highlighted KPIs (MAU, AUC, NCFA, ARPU) as central indicators of engagement and revenue correlation. A sharp, near-term reversal in those same KPIs immediately before pricing—particularly where the issuer provided a June 30, 2021 estimate and described increases as driven by new users—could significantly alter the total mix for a reasonable IPO investor evaluating sustainability of growth and the valuation implied by the offering price.\n\nDefendants’ principal counterarguments (as typically raised on such motions) do not warrant dismissal on this record. First, many challenged statements are not mere puffery; plaintiffs target concrete KPI estimates/tables and specific representations about current-quarter KPI levels and drivers. Second, cautionary “risk factor” language about potential future declines does not immunize alleged omissions of then-existing, already-occurring KPI deterioration; risk disclosures are not adequate if they speak of risks as hypothetical when the complaint plausibly alleges the risk has already materialized. Third, to the extent some statements about mission, customer focus, or “safety-first” are aspirational, plaintiffs also allege contemporaneous operational facts (fraud backlogs, inadequate controls/support, and internal recognition of customer attrition/NPS decline) that, if proven, could render certain qualitative statements misleading in context.\n\nAccordingly, plaintiffs have plausibly stated a Section 11 claim against the issuer, signatories, and underwriters (subject to statutory defenses such as due diligence and negative causation, which are not resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion)."

          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 12(a)(2) imposes liability on a person who offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication containing a material misstatement or omission, to a purchaser from that seller. A plaintiff must plausibly allege statutory standing by pleading that the defendant was a “seller,” meaning either (1) the defendant passed title directly to the plaintiff (direct seller), or (2) the defendant solicited the purchase, motivated at least in part by its own financial interest (Pinter v. Dahl). Conclusory allegations that defendants “promoted” or “solicited” are insufficient; the complaint must connect particular defendants to the plaintiff’s purchase in a manner that makes seller status plausible.\n\nApplication. While plaintiffs adequately plead material misstatements/omissions in the prospectus for purposes of Section 12(a)(2), they do not adequately plead seller/solicitation standing as to “all defendants.” The complaint alleges in generalized terms that defendants “promoted, solicited, and sold” shares and that underwriters conducted roadshow activities, but it does not plausibly allege that Lead Plaintiffs purchased their shares from any particular underwriter (or from Robinhood) or that any particular defendant directly solicited Lead Plaintiffs’ purchases. The pleading does not identify the offering channel used by Lead Plaintiffs, the counterparty to their transaction, or any individualized solicitation.\n\nCourts routinely dismiss Section 12(a)(2) claims at the pleading stage where plaintiffs plead only group allegations of solicitation in an IPO without alleging from whom they purchased or how a particular defendant solicited their purchase. That defect is not cured by alleging that underwriters generally sold allotted shares or that executives participated in a roadshow; without a plausible nexus to plaintiffs’ purchases, seller status remains speculative.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is granted as to the Section 12(a)(2) claim, with leave to amend typically appropriate if plaintiffs can plead facts supporting statutory seller standing (not addressed here because the requested output is claim disposition)."

Section 15 imposes joint and several liability on persons who control a primary violator of Sections 11 or 12, unless the control person had no knowledge of or reasonable ground to believe in the facts giving rise to the violation. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs must plausibly allege (1) a primary violation and (2) control by the defendant.\n\nApplication. Plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded a primary Section 11 violation for the reasons stated above. They also plausibly allege control by the Individual Defendants: Tenev (CEO/President and director), Warnick (CFO), Bhatt (co-founder and director), and the director defendants who signed the registration statement. Executive officers and directors who sign the registration statement and are alleged to have power to influence corporate policy and disclosures generally suffice to plead control at this stage.\n\nBecause Section 15 is derivative, the survival of the Section 11 claim supports the Section 15 claim. Defendants’ potential good-faith/no-knowledge defense is fact-intensive and not resolved on a motion to dismiss where plaintiffs allege, among other things, that key KPIs were tracked internally and discussed in meetings attended by top leadership.\n\nAccordingly, the Section 15 claim against the Individual Defendants survives."

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Steamfitters Local 449 Pension & Retirement Security Funds brings this putative federal securities class action on behalf of purchasers or acquirers of SunPower Corporation (“SunPower”) publicly traded securities during August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Defendants are (1) SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR), headquartered in San Jose, California; (2) Peter Faricy, SunPower’s CEO and President during the Class Period (and a director at the start of the period; became Chairman on November 1, 2021); and (3) Manavendra S. Sial, SunPower’s CFO and EVP during the Class Period.\n\nThe complaint alleges a scheme to mislead investors about (i) the status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business (including margin performance and balance sheet impacts), (ii) whether SunPower was on track to meet FY2021 financial guidance, and (iii) the nature and magnitude of product-quality risks—specifically, defects/cracking in third-party connectors used in SunPower’s commercial solar systems. SunPower had divested manufacturing in 2020 and relied on third-party suppliers for key components; the complaint alleges that defects in “factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment” had already developed “in nearly all” commercial systems, requiring SunPower to incur “tens of millions” in replacement/retrofit costs, rendering prior upbeat statements and “risk factor” disclosures misleading.\n\nKey alleged misstatements/omissions include: (1) August 3, 2021 2Q21 earnings press release and call: Faricy stated results reflected “continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses” and that SunPower remained “on track to achieve our 2021 financial outlook”; Sial stated CIS (heavy commercial) was “significantly better” year-over-year “from a margin point of view” and would be profitable in the back half of the year. (2) August 4, 2021 2Q21 Form 10-Q: risk disclosures framed quality problems as hypothetical (“If we have quality issues…,” “potential future… failures”) and warned of supplier-quality risks, which plaintiff alleges was misleading because the cracking issue already existed and was pervasive. (3) October 5, 2021 call regarding Blue Raven acquisition and CIS “strategic options”: while revising guidance downward due to CIS delays/costs and exploring a CIS sale, defendants allegedly continued to portray commercial as a “point of strength,” “market share leader,” and “very healthy,” implying issues were merely lumpiness/permitting/supply chain rather than an existing widespread defect. (4) November 3, 2021 3Q21 earnings call: Faricy stated SunPower had “found our footing” with its “healthiest balance sheet in years”; November 4, 2021 3Q21 Form 10-Q repeated the same “hypothetical” quality-risk disclosures.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that on December 7, 2021 SunPower posted an updated safety/installation manual adding new warnings about “stress cracking” in connectors and handling practices, which plaintiff characterizes as a partial disclosure consistent with an already-known cracking problem.\n\nCorrective disclosure and alleged loss causation: On January 20, 2022 after market close, SunPower issued a press release (Form 8-K) preannouncing it would miss guidance and would record approximately $27 million in supplier-quality related charges in 4Q21 and $4 million in 1Q22 due to a “cracking issue” that developed over time in certain factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment across CVAR (light commercial) and CIS. The Company stated it would proactively replace all impacted connectors largely during 2022. The next trading day, January 21, 2022, SunPower’s stock fell from $19.02 to $15.80 (down 16.9%) on elevated volume. Analysts cited the breadth (“nearly all” C&I systems since 2019) and suggested the issue likely surfaced during due diligence for the CIS sale process.\n\nThe legal claims asserted are: (1) Count I—Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants, based on alleged materially false and misleading statements/omissions and a fraudulent course of conduct; and (2) Count II—Section 20(a) control-person liability against the individual defendants.\n\nSignificant dates: April 19, 2021 Faricy became CEO; August 3–4, 2021 2Q21 earnings release/call and 10-Q; October 5, 2021 strategic options call; November 3–4, 2021 3Q21 earnings release/call and 10-Q; December 7, 2021 updated manual posted; January 20, 2022 press release disclosing cracking issue and charges (end of Class Period); January 21, 2022 stock drop; February 6, 2022 CIS sale to TotalEnergies announced (post-Class Period).",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5",
          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity must be pleaded with particularity, and scienter must be pleaded with particularity giving rise to a strong inference that is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission (falsity).\n\n(a) Actionable statements sufficiently pleaded. The complaint plausibly pleads falsity as to a subset of statements that conveyed that SunPower’s commercial business was executing well and that the Company was on track with FY21 outlook, while allegedly concealing an already-existing, widespread connector cracking defect that would require tens of millions in remediation costs.\n\nThe January 20, 2022 disclosure describes a cracking issue in factory-installed connectors in third-party commercial equipment, found through a “product quality assessment,” with expected charges of ~$31 million across 4Q21/1Q22 and proactive replacement “largely during 2022.” Coupled with allegations that the issue affected “nearly all” commercial systems and had developed “over time” (with analysts placing affected systems back to 2019), the complaint plausibly alleges that, during at least part of the Class Period, the defect and its financial implications were not merely a contingent risk but an existing condition reasonably likely to materially impact results.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, statements such as Faricy’s August 3, 2021 assertion of “continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses” and that the Company remained “on track to achieve our 2021 financial outlook,” and Sial’s statements that CIS was “significantly better” from a “margin point of view” and expected to be profitable in the back half, are not mere puffery on this pleading record. They speak to current operational performance and trajectory and were made in the context of guidance and segment profitability. If, as alleged, nearly all commercial systems were already affected by a defect requiring large remediation charges, then describing the commercial segment as executing well and implying guidance remained on track could be misleading by omission.\n\nSimilarly, the October 5, 2021 characterization of the commercial business as a “point of great strength” and “very healthy,” while simultaneously attributing guidance variance to lumpiness/permitting/schedule delays, is plausibly misleading if defendants knew the segment’s economics and timing were materially impaired by an existing pervasive defect and looming remediation.\n\n(b) Risk-factor “hypothetical” warnings (Forms 10-Q) — dismissed. The complaint’s theory that the 2Q21 and 3Q21 Forms 10-Q were actionable because they warned only that SunPower “might” face quality issues “if” products were defective, when the defect had already manifested, is not adequately pleaded as a standalone actionable misrepresentation on these facts.\n\nRisk disclosures are actionable when they “speak of risks as hypothetical when in fact they have already materialized,” but plaintiffs must plead with particularity that the risk had in fact materialized at the time and that defendants knew of it. Here, while the complaint alleges the cracking issue had already developed in nearly all commercial systems, it pleads that allegation largely in conclusory terms and by inference from (i) the January 20, 2022 disclosure that the issue developed “over time,” (ii) later analyst commentary suggesting the issue existed since 2019 and may have surfaced in due diligence, and (iii) the December 7, 2021 manual update. Those allegations plausibly support that the issue existed by late 2021 and certainly by January 2022, but they do not plead with the required particularity that, as of August 4, 2021 or November 4, 2021, defendants knew the defect had manifested broadly and that the specific risk-factor language was rendered misleading at those times. The complaint does not identify internal reports, dates of discovery, warranty reserve discussions, customer complaints, field failure rates, or other contemporaneous facts tying knowledge of a pervasive defect to the dates the 10-Qs were filed. Without more, the risk-factor statements are too generalized and forward-looking to be actionable as pleaded.\n\n(c) Certain statements are nonactionable puffery/opinion — dismissed in part. Statements such as “we have found our footing” and generalized optimism about being “well positioned” or having “solid” results may be puffery, but where they are intertwined with concrete assertions about being on track with guidance and segment profitability, they may contribute to the overall misleading impression. The Court dismisses the claim to the extent it is predicated solely on vague corporate optimism untethered to concrete facts.\n\n2. Scienter.\n\nAs to the surviving subset of statements (commercial execution/trajectory and on-track guidance statements), the complaint pleads a strong inference of scienter sufficient to survive at this stage.\n\nThe alleged defect concerned a core aspect of SunPower’s commercial business—factory-installed connectors in third-party commercial equipment—and the remediation allegedly affected “nearly all” commercial systems with charges of approximately $31 million and operational replacement efforts throughout 2022. The magnitude and pervasiveness alleged support an inference that senior management would have been aware of the issue (or at minimum reckless in not knowing) when speaking about commercial margins, profitability, and guidance.\n\nIn addition, the complaint alleges that during the Class Period SunPower was actively exploring and then pursuing a sale of the CIS business, with management describing the process as advanced and aiming to complete it by year-end. It is plausible that a widespread defect requiring significant remediation and potentially affecting safety/warranty exposure would be identified and escalated during operational reviews and diligence efforts connected to a sale process. While analyst speculation alone is not proof, it contributes to the inference when combined with the timing of (i) the October 5 strategic options announcement, (ii) the December 7 manual update adding cracking warnings, and (iii) the January 20 disclosure and immediate quantified charges.\n\nDefendants’ opposing inference—that the cracking issue was only identified later through a “product quality assessment” and that earlier statements reflected then-known scheduling/permitting issues—may ultimately prove more persuasive on a fuller record, but at the pleading stage the inference that senior executives knew of (or were deliberately reckless regarding) a pervasive defect and its financial impact when making specific performance/guidance statements is at least as compelling.\n\n3. Reliance.\n\nThe complaint adequately pleads reliance via the fraud-on-the-market presumption (SunPower traded on NASDAQ; public statements; alleged efficient market) and alternatively invokes Affiliated Ute for omissions. At this stage, those allegations suffice.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss.\n\nThe complaint adequately pleads loss causation by alleging a corrective disclosure on January 20, 2022 revealing the cracking issue and associated charges and guidance miss, followed by a statistically significant price drop (16.9%) on heavy volume on January 21, 2022. That is a plausible causal link between the alleged concealed risk (pervasive cracking defect and remediation costs) and the economic loss.\n\nConclusion. The motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as to Count I. The claim survives to the extent it is based on specific statements and omissions concerning the commercial segment’s performance/trajectory and the Company being on track to meet FY21 outlook, allegedly rendered misleading by concealment of an existing widespread connector cracking defect and its expected remediation costs. The claim is dismissed to the extent it is predicated solely on generalized puffery and to the extent it relies on the Forms 10-Q risk-factor disclosures as independently actionable misstatements/omissions, for failure to plead contemporaneous knowledge and materialization with PSLRA particularity."

A viable primary violation under Section 10(b) is a prerequisite.\n\nBecause the Court sustains Count I in part, the complaint adequately pleads a primary violation.\n\nControl.

According to the complaint, ImmunityBio’s business depended heavily on FDA approval of Anktiva, and defendants repeatedly touted “GMP manufacturing capacity at scale,” “ready-to-scale facilities,” and that the multinational manufacturer used for Anktiva had “cGMP-compliant facilities” with “robust process development and validation and quality oversight.” At the same time, defendants allegedly framed cGMP/manufacturing risks as hypothetical.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity/omissions. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the CMO manufacturing Anktiva drug substance—identified as AGC Biologics’ Bothell, Washington facility—was “plagued” by serious, recurring cGMP failures. Allegations include: (i) FDA issued Form 483s after inspections in March 2021 (16 observations) and July 2021 (3 observations); (ii) chronic delays in batch record release/disposition (sometimes months late); (iii) deviation investigations opened late and left open for extended periods; (iv) critical deviations allegedly closed without CAPA; (v) missed stability-testing windows; (vi) running out of reference material; (vii) multiple failed PPQ runs (six attempts to obtain three successful runs). The complaint relies on four confidential witnesses (including a former AGC facility general manager) and an FDA compliance expert (Todd D. Clark) to characterize these issues as serious and likely to prevent approval.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that after FDA notified AGC in November 2022 of an unusually intensive pre-license inspection (two weeks; six inspectors), ImmunityBio leadership (including Adcock and Soon-Shiong) became highly concerned, conducted a mock inspection in January 2023, learned of continuing deficiencies, and could not remediate them before FDA’s February 2023 inspection. The February 2–10, 2023 pre-license inspection allegedly resulted in a “scathing” 15-page Form 483, with an “Official Action Indicated” (OAI) classification, citing systemic problems in deviation management, data integrity, sanitation/contamination controls, SOP adherence (including stability testing outside windows), and quality-unit oversight. The complaint also alleges a separate pre-license inspection at the fill/finish CMO in January 2023 yielded a five-item Form 483 (validation and maintenance deficiencies).\n\nCorrective disclosure and loss. The complaint alleges the market first learned the truth on May 11, 2023, when ImmunityBio disclosed it had received an FDA Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) dated May 9, 2023, stating FDA could not approve the BLA “in its present form” due to deficiencies relating to pre-license inspections of the Company’s third-party CMOs and additional CMC issues. ImmunityBio’s stock allegedly fell about 55% on May 11, 2023.\n\nLegal claims asserted. Count I asserts violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (misrepresentations/omissions and scheme) against all defendants. Count II asserts control-person liability under Section 20(a) against the individual defendants.\n\nClass period and significant dates. The complaint pleads a Class Period of March 10, 2021 through May 10, 2023 (inclusive), although the class-action allegations section contains an apparent inconsistency referencing March 7, 2021. Significant dates include: March 9, 2021 merger closing; March 10, 2021 start of trading and Form 8-K; March 2021 and July 2021 FDA Form 483s at AGC; May 23, 2022 BLA submission; late July 2022 FDA filing/acceptance and PDUFA date of May 23, 2023; January 11–16, 2023 fill-site inspection and Form 483; February 2–10, 2023 AGC pre-license inspection and Form 483/OAI; May 9, 2023 CRL; May 11, 2023 public disclosure and stock drop.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (misrepresentations/omissions and scheme liability)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must plausibly allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or deliberate recklessness); (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance (often via Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption in an efficient market, or Affiliated Ute for primarily omission-based claims); (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity and scienter must be pleaded with particularity, and the complaint must give rise to a “strong inference” of scienter that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission. The complaint identifies numerous affirmative statements in SEC filings and press releases touting that ImmunityBio had established “GMP manufacturing capacity at scale,” “ready-to-scale facilities,” and that the multinational manufacturer used for Anktiva had “cGMP-compliant facilities” with “robust” validation and quality oversight. The complaint also challenges repeated risk-factor language describing cGMP/manufacturing failures as things that “could” occur, while allegedly omitting that the relevant CMO had already been cited by FDA (Form 483s in March and July 2021), was experiencing chronic batch/disposition and deviation-management failures, and later received a severe pre-license Form 483/OAI during the pendency of the BLA.\n\nAt the pleading stage, these allegations plausibly support falsity and misleading omission. While generalized statements about “capacity at scale” and “expertise” can be non-actionable puffery, the complaint pleads more than aspirational marketing. It alleges concrete statements about cGMP compliance of the specific third-party manufacturer for Anktiva and repeatedly represented manufacturing readiness in the context of the Company’s only near-term value driver (Anktiva approval). Coupled with allegations of known, persistent cGMP failures at the very facility producing the drug substance for the pending BLA, plaintiff plausibly alleges that at least some statements were misleading by omission.\n\nThe “risk factor” theory is also plausibly pleaded. Risk disclosures that warn a problem “may” occur can be actionable when the risk has already materialized or is known to be imminent. Here, plaintiff alleges FDA had already issued Form 483s, the facility had ongoing systemic deficiencies, and by February 2023 FDA had issued a severe Form 483/OAI in the pre-license inspection—yet the Company continued to characterize approval as merely “unclear” and continued to tout GMP capacity and robust cGMP compliance. Those allegations plausibly plead that the disclosures were misleading in context.\n\nMateriality is plausibly alleged because (i) ImmunityBio allegedly had no meaningful revenues and depended on Anktiva approval; (ii) cGMP compliance is a prerequisite to biologics approval; and (iii) the alleged corrective disclosure (CRL based on CMO inspection deficiencies) caused a dramatic price decline.\n\n2. Scienter. The complaint pleads scienter with particularity and supports a strong inference of at least deliberate recklessness. It alleges: (a) the centrality of Anktiva approval to ImmunityBio’s business; (b) multiple FDA Form 483s at AGC during the Class Period; (c) detailed CMO reporting obligations under a quality agreement, including sharing deviations, batch records, and inspection observations; (d) frequent executive-level meetings between Adcock/COO and AGC about delays and deviations; (e) heightened concern and a mock inspection shortly before FDA’s February 2023 inspection; (f) real-time involvement during the FDA inspection, including daily executive calls demanded by Soon-Shiong and Adcock’s travel to the site; and (g) continued public statements after the February 2023 inspection suggesting only uncertainty as to approval and continuing to tout GMP/cGMP strength.\n\nTaken holistically, these allegations support an inference that defendants knew, or were deliberately reckless in not knowing, that the challenged statements and omissions were misleading. Defendants may ultimately argue benign inferences (e.g., reliance on CMO remediation efforts, belief issues were manageable, or that statements concerned internal NK-cell manufacturing rather than Anktiva’s outsourced drug substance). But at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the pleaded facts about executive involvement, the timing and severity of FDA observations, and continued positive/complacent messaging plausibly yield a strong inference of scienter at least as compelling as competing explanations.\n\n3. Reliance. The complaint pleads market efficiency (NASDAQ listing, analyst coverage, trading volume, SEC reporting) and invokes Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. That suffices at this stage. To the extent the case is omission-heavy, plaintiff also pleads Affiliated Ute. Defendants’ rebuttal arguments (price impact, lack of efficiency, individualized reliance) are not resolved on the pleadings.\n\n4. Loss causation and damages. The complaint plausibly alleges loss causation by identifying a corrective disclosure: the May 11, 2023 announcement of the CRL stating FDA could not approve the BLA due to deficiencies relating to pre-license inspections of third-party CMOs and additional CMC issues, followed by an alleged 55% one-day stock drop. That is a plausible causal link between the alleged concealment of manufacturing/cGMP problems and the later revelation/realization of those risks. At pleading stage, plaintiff need not disaggregate all confounding factors with expert precision.\n\n5. Scheme liability. The complaint also pleads a “plan, scheme, and course of conduct.” To the extent scheme liability is based solely on the same alleged misstatements and omissions, it may rise or fall with the misrepresentation theory; the complaint nevertheless plausibly alleges a course of conduct to maintain an inflated price while raising capital (shelf registrations/prospectus supplements) and while allegedly concealing known cGMP failures.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I.",

          "claim": "Section 20(a) (control person liability)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead control-person liability under Section 20(a), plaintiff must allege (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person (here, ImmunityBio and/or the individual defendants as primary violators under Section 10(b)); and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. Many courts also consider culpable participation, though the Ninth Circuit (and others) treat it as an affirmative defense; in any event, allegations supporting scienter often suffice at the pleading stage.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim survives, the complaint adequately pleads a predicate primary violation.\n\nControl. The complaint alleges Soon-Shiong was Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, Adcock was CEO and a Board member, and Sachs was CFO; each signed or authorized SEC filings and allegedly had the ability to influence and control the Company’s public statements. The complaint further alleges hands-on involvement by Soon-Shiong and Adcock in manufacturing/inspection issues central to the alleged fraud. Those allegations plausibly plead control.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II.",

      "summary": "This putative securities-fraud class action is brought on behalf of purchasers of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or the “Company”) securities during the period January 27, 2022 through October 23, 2023 (the “Class Period”). Plaintiffs allege that Danaher and certain senior executives misled investors about the strength and growth outlook of Danaher’s bioprocessing business (principally Cytiva and Pall), particularly as COVID-related demand rolled off and industry-wide destocking and biotech funding constraints reduced orders.\n\nParties. Plaintiffs are investors who purchased or acquired Danaher securities during the Class Period. Defendants are: (1) Danaher, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Washington, D.C., with securities traded on the NYSE (ticker DHR); and (2) Individual Defendants Rainer M. Blair (President/CEO and Board member), Matthew R. McGrew (CFO), and Emmanuel Ligner (head of Cytiva and later Group Executive of the Biotechnology segment). The complaint relies in part on four confidential witnesses (CW1–CW4), including internal communications personnel who interacted with senior leadership and finance personnel describing forecasting processes.\n\nAlleged misconduct / fraudulent conduct. Plaintiffs allege a scheme to portray Danaher’s bioprocessing business as a durable “growth story” and to minimize or deny mounting adverse trends. According to the complaint, as COVID transitioned toward endemic status, demand for COVID-related bioprocessing products fell, while (i) large pharmaceutical customers stockpiled inventory due to long lead times during supply-chain disruptions and then reduced new orders (“destocking”); and (ii) smaller/emerging biotech customers faced tighter capital markets and reduced or delayed projects. Plaintiffs contend Defendants nevertheless repeatedly issued and reaffirmed aggressive guidance and long-term growth narratives for bioprocessing and for Danaher’s “base business core sales” metrics, while allegedly altering non-GAAP definitions to obscure COVID-related declines.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting the claims.\n- Bioprocessing importance: By early 2022 bioprocessing was alleged to be a ~$7.5B franchise and a key driver of Danaher’s valuation.\n- Guidance and statements: Plaintiffs identify numerous statements in press releases, earnings calls, and investor conferences (including 1/27/2022; 3/8/2022; 4/21/2022; 5/11/2022; 7/21/2022; 9/15/2022; 10/20/2022; 11/30/2022; 1/24/2023; 4/25/2023; 5/10/2023; 7/25/2023) asserting, among other things, that: (a) COVID vaccine/therapeutic bioprocessing demand would persist and/or be roughly flat in 2022; (b) non-COVID bioprocessing would grow low-double digits or mid-teens and offset COVID declines; (c) customer inventory build was not significant (only “pockets”); (d) biotech funding issues were not impacting demand; and (e) bioprocessing would grow high single digits long term.\n- Internal processes / scienter allegations: Plaintiffs allege Defendants had access to detailed monthly forecasts (via OneStream) and close customer contact, and cite CW4’s account of Blair allegedly stating after the Q1 2022 earnings call that he and investor relations “made up” better projections than subsidiary presidents provided. Plaintiffs also allege suspicious insider sales by Blair and McGrew during the Class Period.\n- Partial disclosures and stock drops: Plaintiffs allege the “truth” emerged through a series of downward revisions and admissions about bioprocessing demand and guidance, causing significant stock declines on: 10/20/2022 (nearly 6%); 1/24–1/25/2023 (cumulative ~5.2%); 4/25/2023 (~9%); 7/25/2023 (drop alleged); and 10/24–10/25/2023 (cumulative ~5.6%).\n- Item 303 theory: Plaintiffs allege Danaher’s periodic reports omitted known trends/uncertainties (destocking, funding constraints, COVID roll-off) required to be disclosed under Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\n\nLegal claims asserted. The complaint asserts: (Count I) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants (Danaher and the Individual Defendants); and (Count II) Section 20(a) control-person liability against Blair and McGrew.\n\nClass period and significant dates. Class Period: January 27, 2022 through October 23, 2023. Key dates include: 1/27/2022 (introduction of “base business core sales” excluding COVID testing but not COVID bioprocessing); 9/15/2022 (investor day; creation of Biotechnology segment); 1/24/2023 (redefinition of base business to exclude all COVID, including vaccines/therapeutics); and the alleged corrective-disclosure dates 10/20/2022, 1/24/2023, 4/25/2023, 7/25/2023, and 10/24/2023 (after the Class Period end date stated as 10/23/2023, but pleaded as immediately following the Class Period).",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (misrepresentations/omissions and scheme liability)",
          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must plead: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require particularity as to each allegedly false statement, why it was false when made, and facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission.\n(a) Actionable vs. inactionable statements. A substantial portion of the cited statements are non-actionable corporate optimism/puffery (e.g., “strong foundation,” “durable business models,” “positions us well,” “portfolio is unique”), or generalized statements about end-market attractiveness and DBS culture. Such statements are too vague to be materially misleading as a matter of law.\n\nHowever, the complaint also pleads more concrete statements that can be actionable at the pleading stage: specific quantitative guidance and forecasts for bioprocessing COVID revenues (e.g., $2B for 2022; then $1.4–$1.5B; then $1B; then $800M; and $500M for 2023 later reduced to $150M), and specific assertions about order trends, inventory/destocking, and customer demand conditions (e.g., “we don’t see a significant buildup,” “orders/backlog remain very healthy,” “biotech funding crunch not impacting our business,” and explanations that a >20% order decline was merely cadence/lead-time normalization). These are not mere puffery; they are factual representations or mixed statements of present conditions and predictive guidance.\n\n(b) Falsity / misleadingness. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that several of these concrete statements lacked a reasonable basis when made because Defendants allegedly knew (or recklessly disregarded) that: (i) COVID-related bioprocessing demand was declining faster than represented; (ii) non-COVID demand was also weakening due to customer inventory stockpiles/destocking and emerging-biotech funding constraints; and (iii) order declines reflected demand deterioration, not merely lead-time/cadence effects. The complaint supports this theory with detailed chronology of repeated guidance reductions and with allegations that Defendants had close customer visibility and internal forecasting processes.\n\nAt the same time, the complaint overreaches in two respects. First, it attempts to characterize essentially all forward-looking guidance as “made up” or “untethered” without always tying each challenged statement to contemporaneous contradictory facts. Second, to the extent plaintiffs predicate liability on the mere fact that forecasts were later revised downward, that is insufficient; plaintiffs must plead why the forecasts were misleading when made.\n\nAccordingly, the Court sustains the 10b-5 claim only as to the subset of statements that are (i) sufficiently specific and (ii) plausibly alleged to have been misleading when made—particularly statements concerning inventory/destocking conditions, order trends, and the basis/visibility for specific bioprocessing revenue guidance. The claim is dismissed as to non-actionable puffery and vague statements of optimism.\n\n2. Scienter.\nThe PSLRA requires a “strong inference” that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness.\n\nAs to Blair and McGrew: Scienter is plausibly pleaded. The complaint alleges (i) bioprocessing was a core business line of high importance; (ii) Defendants repeatedly represented they had close customer visibility and were tracking inventory and orders “daily”; (iii) order declines and customer behavior (destocking, project delays/cancellations) were allegedly known internally; (iv) CW4 alleges Blair admitted he and investor relations “made up” projections after disliking subsidiary forecasts; and (v) Blair and McGrew allegedly sold significant stock during the Class Period. While insider sales alone are not dispositive and Rule 10b5-1 plans may undercut an inference, at the pleading stage the alleged magnitude/timing combined with the CW allegations and the asserted centrality of the information support a cogent inference of at least deliberate recklessness.\n\nAs to Ligner: The complaint pleads fewer particularized facts tying Ligner to specific misleading statements and to contemporaneous contradictory information. Ligner is quoted at the September 15, 2022 investor day reiterating long-term “high single digit” growth expectations, but the complaint’s scienter allegations as to him rely largely on his role, tenure, and later departure. Role-based allegations, without more particularized facts showing what he knew and when, are generally insufficient under the PSLRA. The 10(b) claim is therefore dismissed as to Ligner for failure to plead scienter with the required particularity.\n\nAs to Danaher: Corporate scienter is plausibly alleged based on the pleaded involvement of the CEO/CFO in the challenged statements and filings.\n\n3. Reliance.\nPlaintiffs plead an efficient market for NYSE-traded Danaher securities and invoke Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. At the pleading stage, this is sufficient.\n\n4. Loss causation.\nPlaintiffs plead a series of alleged partial corrective disclosures (10/20/2022, 1/24/2023, 4/25/2023, 7/25/2023, and 10/24/2023) followed by statistically significant price drops, and allege the disclosures revealed the concealed demand deterioration and repeated guide-downs in bioprocessing. This adequately pleads loss causation at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\n\n5. Scheme liability.\nTo the extent Count I also asserts a “scheme” under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), plaintiffs must plead deceptive conduct beyond misstatements/omissions. Here, the alleged “scheme” largely repackages the misstatement theory (guidance, denials of destocking, and narrative framing). The complaint does not plead distinct manipulative or deceptive acts separate from the alleged misrepresentations sufficient to state an independent scheme claim. Any 10b-5(a)/(c) theory is dismissed as duplicative of the misstatement claim.\n\nResult. The motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim survives against Danaher, Blair, and McGrew as to the specific, plausibly misleading statements about bioprocessing demand, inventory/destocking, order trends, and the basis for concrete revenue guidance; it is dismissed as to (i) puffery/vague optimism, (ii) a standalone scheme theory, and (iii) Ligner for failure to plead scienter."

To plead Section 20(a) liability, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person; and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. Many courts also require culpable participation, though the precise formulation varies by circuit; at the pleading stage, allegations that the control person had the power to control the general affairs of the company and the specific corporate policy resulting in the primary violation are typically sufficient.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Court sustains the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim in part against Danaher, plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a primary violation.\n\nControl. The complaint alleges Blair was CEO and a Board member and McGrew was CFO, that they signed or caused the issuance of key press releases and SEC filings, and that they spoke on earnings calls and at investor conferences regarding the challenged guidance and demand/inventory conditions. These allegations plausibly establish control over Danaher’s public statements and disclosures.\n\nCulpable participation. At this stage, the same allegations supporting scienter as to Blair and McGrew (including close involvement, asserted customer visibility, and CW4’s allegation regarding contrived projections) sufficiently plead culpable participation to the extent required.\n\nResult.

      "summary": "This putative securities class action arises out of Focus Financial Partners Inc.’s (“Focus” or the “Company”) take-private merger with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) at $53.00 per share.\n\nParties. Lead Plaintiffs are AltShares Event-Driven ETF, AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF (together advised by Water Island Capital, LLC), Kryger Event Fund Ltd., Kryger Enhanced Fund Ltd. (advised by Kryger Capital LLC), and ODS Capital LLC. Defendants include: (1) Focus; (2) the “Special Committee Defendants,” Focus directors George S. LeMieux (chair), Elizabeth R. Neuhoff, Greg S. Morganroth, and Joseph Feliciani; (3) the “Board Defendants,” CEO/Chair Ruediger “Rudy” Adolf, COO/director Rajini Sundar Kodialam, and Stone Point designees/directors James Carey and Fayez Muhtadie; (4) the “Officer Defendants,” CFO James Shanahan, Head of M&A Leonard Chang, and General Counsel/Corporate Secretary J. Russell McGranahan (along with Adolf and Kodialam); (5) Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), Focus’s largest stockholder (~20.6%) with contractual and board influence; (6) CD&R (acquiror); (7) Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (financial advisor and fairness opinion provider); and (8) Jefferies LLC (second financial advisor and fairness opinion provider). The complaint also names outside counsel (Vinson & Elkins; Potter Anderson) in the factual narrative but does not plead Exchange Act claims against them.\n\nAlleged misconduct and fraudulent scheme. Plaintiffs allege Defendants orchestrated and concealed a conflicted and value-depressing sale process designed to favor a private equity buyer (CD&R) that would (i) permit Stone Point to roll over equity and invest new capital post-closing, (ii) preserve management’s positions and provide management rollover opportunities, and (iii) trigger lucrative Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) change-of-control payouts for Stone Point and insiders. According to the complaint, Defendants:\n\n• Tilted the process toward financial sponsors and failed to canvass strategic buyers who could pay more due to synergies.\n• Gave CD&R months of effectively exclusive access to diligence and negotiations, creating an informational advantage.\n• “Stiff-armed” a strategic bidder (“Party I,” unnamed in the public proxy but alleged to have offered $55.00 per share) by delaying engagement, limiting diligence, and refusing exclusivity, while granting CD&R exclusivity at a lower price.\n• Allowed Stone Point—allegedly conflicted by a desire to liquidate and by accelerated TRA economics—to drive timing and counterpart selection, including through contractual “levers” (board nomination rights, compensation committee control, and debt portability/change-of-control provisions).\n• Operated through a “conflicted” Special Committee whose members allegedly received unique merger-related benefits (TRA payments, accelerated equity, and increased special committee fees), had personal/business ties to Adolf and/or CD&R, and nonetheless were touted as independent.\n• Used conflicted financial advisors: Goldman Sachs allegedly had extensive ties to Stone Point and CD&R and allegedly narrowed the bidder universe due to a contemporaneous, competing sale process for Focus subsidiary NKSFB/KSFB; Jefferies allegedly received a last-minute, undisclosed increase to its discretionary fee (from $1 million to up to $8 million) just before issuing its fairness opinion.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity/materiality. Plaintiffs focus on alleged misstatements and omissions in (i) the February 27, 2023 press release and Form 8-K announcing the merger, and (ii) the definitive proxy statement filed June 12, 2023 (and an allegedly inadequate supplemental proxy filed July 6, 2023). The alleged misstatements/omissions include, among others:\n\n• Statements that the Special Committee was “independent and disinterested,” had no material interests different from public shareholders, and ran a “robust” process yielding the “best value reasonably obtainable.”\n• Omission of the Special Committee members’ alleged conflicts, including (a) TRA-related payments and accelerated equity and (b) a substantial, self-approved fee increase executed immediately before the committee approved the merger.\n• Omission of personal/business relationships (e.g., LeMieux’s law firm allegedly representing CD&R in immigration matters; friendships/associations with Adolf; other ties).\n• Misleading process narrative allegedly minimizing or omitting early strategic interest and CEO-level contact by the strategic bidder that later offered $55.\n• Misleading descriptions of CD&R proposals by omitting that CD&R allegedly required a partner and offered Stone Point/management “material” rollover benefits.\n• Omission that Goldman Sachs’s KSFB/NKSFB engagement allegedly constrained bidder outreach until after signing, and omission of details showing the constraint.\n• Omission that Jefferies’ discretionary fee was increased eightfold immediately before its fairness opinion.\n\nClaims asserted. The complaint pleads three Exchange Act causes of action:\n\nCount I: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a)-(c) (scheme liability) against “all Defendants,” alleging a deceptive scheme and omissions/misstatements that artificially deflated Focus’s trading price during the class period.\n\nCount II: Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 against Focus, the Special Committee Defendants, the Board Defendants, and the Officer Defendants, alleging the proxy was materially false/misleading and was an essential link to shareholder approval; the complaint expressly pleads negligence for this count.\n\nCount III: Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Special Committee Defendants, Board Defendants, and Officer Defendants, predicated on primary violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a).\n\nClass period and significant dates. For the Section 10(b) class, Plaintiffs define the Class Period as February 27, 2023 (merger announcement) through August 31, 2023 (merger closing and delisting). For the Section 14(a) voting class, Plaintiffs define record-date holders as of June 9, 2023 (Record Date). Key dates include: summer 2022 commencement of sale exploration; November 1, 2022 formation of Special Committee; January 22, 2023 alleged $55 proposal from the strategic bidder; January 30, 2023 exclusivity with CD&R; February 27, 2023 signing/announcement at $53; April 25, 2023 preliminary proxy; June 12, 2023 definitive proxy; July 6, 2023 supplemental proxy; July 14, 2023 shareholder vote; August 31, 2023 closing.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a)-(c) (scheme liability)",
          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must plead (1) a material misrepresentation or omission (or a deceptive act for scheme liability), (2) scienter, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, (5) economic loss, and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require particularity as to falsity and a “strong inference” of scienter. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)-(2); Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007). Where a theory is that the market price was distorted, plaintiffs must plausibly plead loss causation—i.e., that the revelation of the truth, or a materialization of the concealed risk, caused a price decline. Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005).\n\nApplication.\n\n1) Material misstatement/omission. The complaint identifies numerous alleged omissions and misleading statements about conflicts, process, and banker fees in the merger announcement and proxy materials. Many of these allegations plausibly concern information a reasonable stockholder would consider important in evaluating the merger and the proxy solicitation (e.g., undisclosed conflicts, banker incentives, and process details). At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs adequately allege that at least some challenged statements—particularly categorical assertions of “independence and disinterestedness” and a “robust process” yielding the “best value reasonably obtainable”—could be misleading if the omitted conflict and process facts are true. This element is not the principal defect.\n\n2) Scienter. The complaint pleads scienter largely by inference from (i) the importance of the transaction, (ii) defendants’ positions, and (iii) alleged personal financial incentives (TRA payments, retention/rollover interests, fees). Those allegations may support motive and opportunity for some individuals, but the PSLRA requires a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or severe recklessness. As to Focus itself, scienter must be pleaded via particularized facts showing that an agent whose scienter is imputable to the corporation acted with the requisite state of mind.\n\nEven assuming arguendo that scienter is adequately pleaded as to certain insiders, the claim still fails on loss causation (below), which is independently dispositive.\n\n3) Reliance. Plaintiffs invoke Affiliated Ute and fraud-on-the-market. However, this case concerns a cash-out merger where the core alleged harm is that stockholders were cashed out at an unfairly low price. That theory is typically addressed through Section 14(a) (proxy causation) or state fiduciary duty claims, not a market-reliance theory that the trading price was “artificially deflated” absent a corrective disclosure. Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) class is defined as sellers from announcement through closing, including those who tendered/exchanged into the merger. Reliance is not clearly pleaded for the tendering stockholders under a market-price theory because their price was contractually fixed by the deal and their decision turns on the vote/solicitation.\n\n4) Loss causation. The complaint alleges the stock traded “tethered” to the $53 deal price and would have traded higher had the market known the “truth” about the process and potential higher bids. But it does not plead a plausible corrective disclosure and resulting price decline attributable to revelation of the alleged fraud. To the contrary, the alleged misstatements are said to have kept the price artificially low relative to a hypothetical higher deal price; yet there is no pleaded event during the class period that revealed the truth and caused a loss-bearing price drop. Where the alleged inflation/deflation is tied to a merger price, plaintiffs must still allege that the truth became known and caused a market loss, or that the concealed risk materialized in a way that caused economic loss in the market. See Dura, 544 U.S. at 342-46.\n\nHere, the merger closed at the deal price. Plaintiffs’ theory is essentially “lost merger consideration” (i.e., they should have received $55 or more). That is not a paradigmatic Section 10(b) loss causation theory absent a pleaded corrective disclosure and a market loss. The complaint’s own narrative emphasizes that the challenged information was disclosed (at least in part) in a July 6, 2023 supplemental proxy, but it does not plead that this disclosure caused a stock-price decline (or any other market-based loss) as required under Dura. Nor does it plead that the merger failed or that a corrective disclosure caused the price to fall from an inflated level; rather, the asserted harm is that the price stayed near $53.\n\nBecause Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead loss causation for a 10b-5 market-manipulation/deflation theory, Count I is dismissed.\n\n5) Scheme liability. Plaintiffs style the claim under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), but scheme liability cannot be used to evade the misstatement framework where the gravamen is misleading disclosures. In any event, scheme liability still requires scienter and loss causation, which are not adequately pleaded.\n\nRuling. The motion to dismiss is granted as to Count I."

          "claim": "Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 (proxy misstatements/omissions)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 prohibit materially false or misleading statements or omissions in proxy solicitations. To plead a private damages claim, plaintiffs must plausibly allege (1) a proxy statement contained a material misrepresentation or omission, (2) causation—often framed as transaction causation/“essential link” between the proxy solicitation and the transaction approved, and (3) negligence (scienter is not required for a Section 14(a) claim in this Circuit absent special circumstances). See Mills v. Elec. Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375 (1970); Va. Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083 (1991). Under the PSLRA, forward-looking statements may be protected by safe harbor if accompanied by meaningful cautionary language and not made with actual knowledge of falsity.\n\nApplication.\n\n1) Material misstatements/omissions. Plaintiffs plead with substantial specificity a set of alleged omissions and misleading statements in the definitive proxy (June 12, 2023) and related disclosures. At the pleading stage, several categories are plausibly material under the “total mix” standard:\n\n• Special Committee independence and conflicts. The proxy allegedly made repeated, categorical assertions that the Special Committee consisted solely of “independent and disinterested” directors with no material interests different from public stockholders. Plaintiffs allege undisclosed (or inadequately disclosed) merger-contingent benefits to committee members (TRA-related payments, accelerated equity, and—critically—an allegedly self-approved, last-minute fee increase executed immediately before approving the merger). Information about banker and director conflicts is frequently material in merger-vote contexts because it bears on the reliability of the process and the recommendation.\n\n• Banker conflicts and incentives. Plaintiffs allege the proxy omitted that Jefferies’ discretionary fee was increased eightfold on the eve of its fairness opinion and that Goldman Sachs’ parallel KSFB/NKSFB engagement constrained bidder outreach. At the pleading stage, those allegations plausibly describe conflicts/incentives a reasonable stockholder would consider important in weighing the fairness opinions and the board’s process narrative.\n\n• Process narrative and competing bidder treatment. Plaintiffs allege the proxy’s “best value reasonably obtainable” and “robust process” narrative was misleading because it omitted facts showing strategic-buyer interest, delayed engagement with a strategic bidder, and preferential treatment of CD&R (including exclusivity and diligence disparities). While some statements about process can be non-actionable opinion or corporate optimism, the complaint pleads specific omitted facts that, if true, could render the process description misleading.\n\nDefendants may ultimately contest materiality on a developed record, but at this stage Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged materially misleading omissions.\n\n2) Causation/essential link. Plaintiffs allege the proxy was used to solicit stockholder approval, that the vote occurred July 14, 2023, and that the merger closed August 31, 2023. Under Mills, where stockholder authorization is required by law and the proxy solicitation is an essential link in accomplishing the transaction, transaction causation is plausibly alleged. Plaintiffs plead that absent the misleading proxy, stockholders could have voted differently or sought appraisal/other remedies, and that the vote was required for the merger. That suffices at the pleading stage.\n\n3) Negligence. Plaintiffs expressly plead Count II as negligence and allege defendants prepared, reviewed, signed, and disseminated the proxy and had access to the omitted information. Those allegations plausibly support a failure to exercise reasonable care in ensuring the proxy was not misleading.\n\n4) Supplemental proxy timing. Defendants argue (and will likely argue on the motion) that later disclosures cured earlier omissions. The complaint plausibly alleges the July 6, 2023 supplemental proxy was issued only six business days before the vote and did not fully cure the alleged misstatements (including allegedly omitting the fee increase and personal/business ties). Whether any supplementation cured material omissions is fact-intensive; at the pleading stage, Plaintiffs plausibly allege the corrective disclosure was incomplete and too late to render the solicitation fully informed.\n\nRuling. The motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 20(a) imposes joint and several liability on controlling persons for a controlled person’s primary Exchange Act violation, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation. Plaintiffs must plead (1) a primary violation, (2) control of the primary violator, and (3) (in many circuits) culpable participation, though the precise pleading requirement varies.\n\nApplication.\n\nPrimary violation. As ruled above, Plaintiffs have stated a primary claim under Section 14(a) but have not stated a primary claim under Section 10(b).\n\nControl. The complaint alleges the individual director and officer defendants had power to control Focus’s proxy disclosures and the merger process, including that the proxy was issued by order of the board and signed by Adolf and McGranahan. At the pleading stage, those allegations plausibly plead control for Section 20(a) purposes as to the proxy-related primary violation.\n\nScope. Because Count I (Section 10(b)) is dismissed, Section 20(a) cannot proceed to the extent it is predicated on a 10b-5 primary violation. However, it may proceed to the extent it is predicated on the surviving Section 14(a) claim.\n\nRuling. The motion to dismiss is granted as to Count III insofar as it is based on an alleged Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 primary violation, and denied insofar as it is based on the alleged Section 14(a)/Rule 14a-9 primary violation."

      "summary": "This putative securities-fraud class action is brought under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 on behalf of purchasers of Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) common stock during March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020 (the “Class Period”), who also held shares on March 24, 2020 and/or December 22, 2020. The named plaintiffs are Kim Kengle (as trustee of the Kim K. Kengle 2000 Trust) and Roseanne Lacy (collectively, “Investors” or “Plaintiffs”). Defendants are Walmart, and two senior executives: CEO Douglas C. McMillon and CFO M. Brett Biggs (the “Individual Defendants”).\n\nThe complaint alleges that for years Walmart violated the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) as both (i) a dispenser through nearly 5,000 retail pharmacies and (ii) a distributor (until 2018) supplying controlled substances to its own pharmacies, and that it concealed from investors (a) a nationwide 2011 Memorandum of Agreement with the DEA (the “2011 MOA”) resolving a 2009 DEA enforcement action (the “2009 OTSC”), (b) Walmart’s noncompliance with the MOA and CSA, and (c) intensifying DOJ criminal and civil investigations into those violations (together, the “Government Investigations”). Plaintiffs contend Walmart’s internal documents (e.g., 2013–2015 compliance/risk assessment materials) acknowledged a lack of adequate suspicious order monitoring and warned of “severe” financial and reputational harm. They further allege that in March/May 2018 the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas advised Walmart that an indictment was imminent and sought a $1 billion civil resolution; DOJ later declined to indict (August 31, 2018) but continued a broad civil investigation culminating in a DOJ civil enforcement complaint filed December 22, 2020.\n\nAccording to Plaintiffs, throughout the Class Period Walmart’s SEC filings and public statements were materially false and misleading because they: (1) stated, in “Contingencies/Legal Proceedings” footnotes, that where a liability was “reasonably possible and may be material,” it had been disclosed—while allegedly omitting the Government Investigations and the 2011 MOA; (2) failed to disclose loss contingencies and material legal proceedings as required by GAAP (ASC 450) and Regulation S-K Item 103; (3) used boilerplate “risk factors” that framed regulatory and enforcement risks as hypothetical even though, Plaintiffs allege, DOJ investigations and severe CSA exposure were already underway; (4) issued allegedly misleading “opioid stewardship” PR statements touting “comprehensive policies and training” and patient-safety priorities while, Plaintiffs allege, internal practices prioritized speed and sales, impeded pharmacists’ ability to refuse illegitimate prescriptions, and lacked effective suspicious order monitoring; and (5) included allegedly false Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) certifications by McMillon and Biggs attesting to the accuracy of filings and adequacy of controls despite the alleged nondisclosures.\n\nPlaintiffs plead two corrective disclosures and related stock drops: (i) March 25, 2020, when ProPublica published an exposé disclosing the DOJ criminal investigation since 2016, the near-indictment in 2018, the ongoing civil investigation, the 2011 MOA, and DEA admonition letters; Walmart stock allegedly fell about 5% that day. (ii) December 22, 2020, when DOJ announced and filed a civil CSA enforcement action seeking potentially “billions” in penalties and injunctive relief; Walmart stock allegedly fell about 1.88% over the next two trading days.\n\nThe legal claims asserted are: Count I—Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; Count II—Section 20(a) control-person liability against McMillon and Biggs. Significant dates include: March 31, 2017 (start of Class Period; filing of FY2017 10-K for year ended Jan. 31, 2017); Dec. 7, 2016 (alleged start of DOJ criminal investigation after DEA raid, pleaded as background); Nov. 2017 (alleged start of parallel DOJ civil investigation); March/May 2018 (near-indictment and settlement demand); Aug. 31, 2018 (DOJ declination of indictment); March 25, 2020 (ProPublica disclosure); Dec. 22, 2020 (DOJ civil enforcement action; end of Class Period).",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (Exchange Act) (Count I)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private securities-fraud claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007). Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity and scienter must be pleaded with particularity; scienter must support a “strong inference” that is “cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.”\n\n1. Material misrepresentation or omission. Plaintiffs adequately plead actionable omissions and half-truths.\n\n(a) “Legal Proceedings/Contingencies” statements and GAAP/ASC 450 theory. The complaint identifies repeated statements in Walmart’s Forms 10-K and 10-Q to the effect that “where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed,” coupled with detailed disclosure of other matters (e.g., Opioid MDL; other subpoenas) but not the Government Investigations. At the pleading stage, these allegations plausibly state a misleading half-truth: once Walmart represented that it had disclosed reasonably possible material liabilities, and selectively described certain investigations and proceedings, the omission of a major DOJ criminal investigation (and later a broad DOJ civil investigation) plausibly rendered the disclosures misleading. Whether ASC 450 or Item 103 ultimately required disclosure is not dispositive at this stage; a duty to disclose may arise from making a statement that is misleading absent the omitted information.\n\nThe complaint pleads particularized facts supporting materiality: the alleged near-indictment, the scale of potential penalties (billions), and the market reaction to later disclosures. These are not merely “risk of litigation” allegations; Plaintiffs allege an existing, long-running DOJ criminal investigation beginning in 2016, expanded warrants/subpoenas, and an imminent indictment communicated in 2018. Such information is plausibly material to a reasonable investor.\n\n(b) Risk-factor disclosures framed as hypothetical. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that certain risk disclosures describing regulatory enforcement and sanctions as contingent/hypothetical were misleading because, as pleaded, Walmart was already under active DOJ investigation and had been told of an imminent indictment. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, allegations that risk factors warned of enforcement actions as possibilities while omitting that enforcement actions were already being pursued can state a claim.\n\n(c) “Opioid stewardship” statements. Some statements appear to be non-actionable corporate puffery (e.g., generalized commitments to “be part of the solution”). However, the complaint identifies at least one more concrete assertion—e.g., that Walmart had “comprehensive policies and training” supporting pharmacists in filling prescriptions only for legitimate medical purposes. Given the detailed allegations (including the DOJ complaint incorporated by reference) that Walmart’s systems and policies impeded red-flag resolution and refusal-to-fill practices, Plaintiffs plausibly plead falsity as to these more specific representations.\n\n(d) SOX certifications. SOX certifications are not independently actionable absent an underlying materially false or misleading filing, but they can support falsity/scienter allegations. Here, because Plaintiffs plausibly plead that the underlying filings were misleading, the certifications may be considered as part of the overall alleged scheme.\n\n2. Scienter. Plaintiffs plead a strong inference of at least recklessness, and plausibly of knowledge, as to Walmart and the Individual Defendants.\n\nThe complaint alleges: (i) the DOJ criminal investigation began in 2016 following a DEA raid; (ii) in March/May 2018 prosecutors advised Walmart an indictment was imminent and demanded $1 billion civilly; (iii) Walmart’s senior leadership (including McMillon) was consulted on DOJ presentations; (iv) internal compliance/risk documents (2013–2015) described the absence of adequate suspicious order monitoring and warned of “severe” financial/reputational harm; (v) both McMillon and Biggs were members of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee; and (vi) Walmart made selective disclosures about other investigations/subpoenas while not specifically disclosing the opioid-related Government Investigations.\n\nAt the pleading stage, these allegations support a cogent inference that Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that omitting the Government Investigations while affirmatively representing that reasonably possible material liabilities had been disclosed created a misleading picture. The competing non-fraud inference—that Walmart believed disclosure was not required because investigations were preliminary or non-material—is not more compelling on these pleaded facts, particularly given the alleged near-indictment, the scale of exposure, and the asserted internal recognition of severe risk.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead reliance under the fraud-on-the-market presumption (Walmart stock traded on the NYSE; alleged analyst coverage; alleged price reaction to disclosures). At this stage, that suffices.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead two alleged corrective disclosures (ProPublica on March 25, 2020; DOJ enforcement action on December 22, 2020) and corresponding price declines. While Defendants may later contest whether these were “corrective” as opposed to merely reporting previously known risks or reflecting confounding market forces, the complaint plausibly alleges that the disclosures revealed previously concealed facts about the existence and seriousness of the Government Investigations and the scale of CSA exposure, and that the stock price fell in response. That is sufficient at the pleading stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

To state a claim under Section 20(a), Plaintiffs must plead: (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person; and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the controlled person. Many courts also require culpable participation, though the precise formulation varies by circuit; at the pleading stage, allegations of control coupled with the primary violation generally suffice.\n\n1. Primary violation. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim survives, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a primary violation by Walmart.\n\n2. Control. Plaintiffs plausibly plead that McMillon (CEO) and Biggs (CFO) had control over Walmart’s public statements and SEC filings: both signed the relevant Forms 10-K and 10-Q and SOX certifications; both allegedly participated in senior management and the Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee; and the complaint alleges involvement in disclosure controls and oversight of compliance risks.\n\nAt this stage, these allegations are sufficient to plead control-person liability. Any “good faith” defense or challenges to culpable participation are fact-intensive and not resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

      "summary": "This is a Securities Act class action arising from GoHealth, Inc.’s July 2020 initial public offering. Lead Plaintiffs Sudhakara R. Murikinati, Jerry Nixon, Benjamin Sandmann, and Jeff S. Turnipseed allege they purchased GoHealth Class A common stock in and/or traceable to the IPO registration statement and were damaged.\n\nDefendants fall into several groups. The issuer is GoHealth, Inc. (Delaware; headquartered in Chicago). Individual Defendants are GoHealth’s senior executives/directors who signed the registration statement: (1) Clinton P. Jones (co-founder, CEO, Co-Chair), (2) Brandon M. Cruz (co-founder, Chief Strategy Officer/Special Advisor, Co-Chair), and (3) Travis J. Matthiesen (CFO). Plaintiffs also sue alleged control persons: NVX Holdings, Inc. (an entity controlled by Jones and Cruz housing founder ownership) and Centerbridge-related entities (Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and affiliated holding vehicles and general partners), which acquired control of the operating business in September 2019. Underwriter Defendants are Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.\n\nThe complaint alleges GoHealth operates a technology-enabled health insurance marketplace with a major focus on Medicare Advantage sales. GoHealth’s revenue model depends on carrier commissions and recurring commissions tied to customer “persistency,” with “churn” (disenrollment/switching) reducing lifetime value. A key metric touted in the IPO materials was “LTV/CAC,” a ratio of estimated lifetime commissions per approved submission divided by consumer acquisition cost.\n\nThe core alleged misconduct is that the IPO registration statement and prospectus contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions because they failed to disclose that, at the time of the IPO, GoHealth was (i) experiencing heightened churn / impaired persistency and (ii) had reached the limits of growth achievable under its then-existing, highly concentrated Medicare carrier model (dominated by Humana and Anthem), requiring a near-term disruptive strategic shift. Plaintiffs allege GoHealth had planned for 2020 to be an “investment year” involving rapid expansion to new Medicare carriers and increased emphasis on Special Needs Plans (SNPs), which would (and did) create near-term adverse effects: lower initial commission rates from new carriers; reduced marketing subsidies; increased marketing and agent-training costs; less reliable LTV assumptions due to limited data; increased churn/lower effectuation (especially for SNPs); and a shift toward non-commissionable “other” revenue, all pressuring LTV and LTV/CAC.\n\nPlaintiffs point to post-IPO disclosures as revealing these allegedly omitted facts: (1) August 19, 2020 2Q20 earnings release/call (quarter ended June 30, 2020—two weeks before IPO) describing new carrier additions, lower initial LTV/commission rates, SNP mix creating near-term LTV drag, and retention/churn issues (including low 90-day retention in new markets and higher SNP disenrollment); (2) November 11, 2020 3Q20 results showing losses and a revenue mix shift with higher “other” revenue and elevated marketing spend; and (3) December 2, 2020 conference remarks by Jones and CFO Matthiesen explicitly describing 2020 as an anticipated “investment year” with new carriers, lower commission levels, LTV compression, and upside expected in 2021 after achieving top-tier contracts.\n\nThe offering and class definition: the IPO was priced July 14, 2020 at $21.00 per share; GoHealth sold approximately 44.5 million shares (completed July 17, 2020) generating over $913 million gross proceeds. The proposed class is all persons who purchased GoHealth Class A common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO registration statement. Plaintiffs allege the stock declined from $21.00 to $13.32 by suit filing and to an intraperiod low around $10.05 on December 1, 2020.\n\nLegal claims asserted are limited to strict-liability/negligence-based Securities Act claims: Count I under Section 11 against GoHealth, the Individual Defendants, and the Underwriter Defendants; and Count II under Section 15 against GoHealth, the Individual Defendants, NVX Holdings, and Centerbridge as control persons. The complaint also pleads that omissions violated Items 303 and 105 of Regulation S-K and SAB 104 (MD&A and risk-factor disclosure duties), as part of the Section 11 theory.",

Section 11 imposes liability where a registration statement, at the time it became effective, contained (1) an untrue statement of a material fact, (2) omitted a material fact required to be stated therein, or (3) omitted a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Materiality is assessed under the substantial-likelihood standard (a reasonable investor would view the information as significantly altering the total mix). Plaintiffs need not plead scienter, reliance, or loss causation, though they must plead a plausible material misstatement/omission and traceability to the offering. Under Rule 12(b)(6) and the plausibility standard, the Court accepts well-pleaded facts as true and draws reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor. To the extent the complaint sounds in fraud, Rule 9(b) may apply, but plaintiffs expressly disclaim fraud and plead negligence/strict liability; at this stage the Court evaluates whether the allegations plausibly identify actionable misstatements/omissions.\n\n2. Actionable omission theory plausibly pleaded. Plaintiffs’ theory is not merely that GoHealth later pursued a growth strategy that turned out poorly; it is that, before and at the IPO, management had already planned and begun executing a material strategic shift—an “investment year” involving rapid carrier expansion and increased SNP mix—that carried known, near-term adverse consequences for GoHealth’s key profitability metric (LTV/LTV-CAC), commission rates, marketing costs, and churn/persistency. The complaint pleads with specificity that: (a) GoHealth’s Medicare business was heavily concentrated in Humana and Anthem (74% of total revenue in 1Q20; ~85% of Medicare segment revenue), (b) GoHealth had effectively “maximized” growth under that concentrated model, and (c) adding new carriers would predictably come with lower initial commission rates, less marketing support, integration/training costs, less reliable LTV estimation, and increased churn—factors that directly affect revenue recognition and the commissions receivable asset given GoHealth’s cohort-based LTV accounting.\n\nThese allegations plausibly describe “known trends or uncertainties” and “most significant” offering risks that, if known, would be important to a reasonable investor in evaluating GoHealth’s touted unit economics and growth narrative. The complaint also identifies specific statements in the registration statement that could be rendered misleading by the alleged omissions, including repeated representations that scaling and carrier expansion would “improve” LTV/CAC drivers, that carrier supplementation of marketing/technology investments would support economics, and that GoHealth could “rapidly scale while improving” unit economics. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs plausibly allege that omitting the planned near-term LTV compression, increased churn risk, and materially higher marketing spend associated with the strategic pivot could make these affirmative statements misleading.\n\n3. Item 303 / Item 105 / SAB 104 theories support Section 11. Plaintiffs also plead that the omitted information was required to be disclosed under Item 303 (known trends/uncertainties reasonably likely to have material effects), Item 105 (most significant risk factors), and SAB 104 (MD&A discussion of revenue drivers and changing trends/customer/channel mix). In this Circuit and others, an Item 303 omission can be actionable under Section 11 where the omitted trend/uncertainty is material and required to be disclosed. The complaint plausibly alleges that (i) management knew of the strategic shift and its near-term economic consequences, (ii) the shift was underway by 2Q20 (ended June 30, 2020) and thus known at effectiveness (July 14, 2020), and (iii) the consequences were reasonably likely to materially affect operating results and key metrics. Similarly, plaintiffs plausibly allege that generic risk disclosures warning that commission rates “may” change or that carrier relationships “could” be harmed were inadequate if the company was already experiencing and planning a near-term period of lower commissions/LTV and higher churn/marketing spend as part of its strategy.\n\n4. Materiality is plausible. The alleged omissions concern GoHealth’s most important segment (Medicare), its most emphasized metric (LTV/CAC), revenue mix (commissionable vs. non-commissionable), and churn/persistency—all central to valuation. The complaint further alleges a rapid post-IPO stock decline following disclosures about lower LTVs, higher churn, and higher marketing spend. While price movement is not required for Section 11, it supports plausibility of materiality.\n\n5. Defendants’ principal counterarguments are better suited for later stages. Defendants may argue that the registration statement disclosed carrier concentration, that it discussed plans to expand carrier footprint/geography, and that risk factors warned of commission variability and LTV estimation uncertainty. On a motion to dismiss, however, the Court must assess whether plaintiffs plausibly allege that disclosures were materially incomplete or misleading because they failed to convey that (a) management had already planned 2020 as an “investment year,” (b) near-term LTV compression and lower commission rates were expected as a consequence, and (c) churn/persistency pressures (including low retention in new markets and higher SNP disenrollment) were already being observed. The complaint’s detailed post-IPO quotations attributed to Jones and Matthiesen—describing the investment-year plan as anticipated and modeled—support an inference that these were known at the IPO.\n\n6. Underwriter and individual-defendant liability. Section 11 provides a cause of action against the issuer, signatories, directors/officers, and underwriters. Plaintiffs adequately plead that the Individual Defendants signed the registration statement and that the Underwriter Defendants acted as underwriters. Whether the underwriters can establish a due-diligence defense is an affirmative defense not resolved on the pleadings.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 11 claim."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "1. Legal standard. Section 15 imposes joint and several liability on any person who controls a primary violator of Section 11, unless the control person had no knowledge of or reasonable ground to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability of the controlled person is alleged to exist. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs must plausibly allege (1) a primary violation (here, Section 11) and (2) control.\n\n2. Primary violation adequately alleged. Because the Section 11 claim survives, the first element is satisfied.\n\n3. Control adequately alleged as to each Section 15 defendant group.\n\n(a) Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges Jones and Cruz were co-founders, Co-Chairs, and senior executives, and Matthiesen was CFO; all signed the registration statement. These allegations plausibly support power to direct or influence GoHealth’s management and the contents of the offering materials.\n\n(b) GoHealth as control person of its officers/employees. Plaintiffs plead GoHealth controlled and directed its senior managers, directors, employees, and agents, including the Individual Defendants, in connection with the registration statement. At the pleading stage, issuer control over its officers for Section 15 purposes is plausibly alleged.\n\n(c) NVX Holdings and Centerbridge. Plaintiffs plead that GoHealth was a Nasdaq “controlled company” post-IPO, and that NVX Holdings and Centerbridge collectively held majority voting power and exercised significant influence over board composition and corporate decisions. The registration statement itself is quoted as acknowledging that the Founders and Centerbridge would control approximately 70.8% of voting power and would exercise significant influence over management and major transactions. These allegations plausibly plead control.\n\n4. Knowledge / good-faith defense not resolved now. Any contention that particular control persons lacked knowledge or acted in good faith is fact-intensive and generally not resolved at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 15 claim."

      "summary": "Plaintiff DarkPulse, Inc. (“DarkPulse”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York. DarkPulse alleges it is a microcap public company whose stock trades on the OTC market. Defendants are (1) FirstFire Global Opportunities Fund, LLC / FirstFire (an LLC with principal place of business in New York) and (2) Eli Fireman (alleged managing member/controller of FirstFire and related entities). The complaint alleges FirstFire is a “death spiral/toxic” convertible-note lender that is, in substance, an unregistered securities dealer that repeatedly enters into convertible promissory note financings with microcap issuers, converts debt into newly issued issuer shares at a discount (or at a default-reset price), and immediately sells (“dumps”) those shares into the public market for profit.\n\nThe alleged misconduct centers on two convertible note transactions between DarkPulse and FirstFire (collectively, the “DarkPulse Transactions”), and the subsequent conversions and sales of the resulting shares (the “Performance Transactions”).\n\n1) September 2018 Note/SPA: FirstFire allegedly paid $225,000 and received a note with a face amount of $247,500 plus 8% interest, nine-month maturity, and a conversion right beginning 180 days after purchase at a 30% discount to market (and allegedly using a “20-day low” mechanism that made the effective discount larger). DarkPulse alleges FirstFire began converting on June 7, 2019, and over time executed 18 conversions through February 18, 2021, exchanging $247,500 of debt for 879,400,000 shares. DarkPulse estimates the open-market value of the shares acquired via these conversions at approximately $10.7 million. DarkPulse alleges trading volume increased after conversions, supporting an inference that FirstFire immediately sold the shares into the market.\n\n2) April 2021 Note/SPA: FirstFire allegedly paid $750,000 for a note with a face amount of $825,000 plus 10% interest, nine-month maturity, a fixed conversion price of $0.015/share that allegedly reset to $0.005/share upon default, and a requirement that DarkPulse issue 60,000,000 “commitment shares” at inception. DarkPulse alleges that on April 26, 2021 the stock traded at about $0.019/share, making the commitment shares worth about $1.14 million. DarkPulse contends this up-front equity consideration, together with the note terms, rendered the loan criminally usurious under New York law. The six-month restriction on the shares allegedly expired October 26, 2021. On November 4, 2021, Fireman allegedly procured DarkPulse’s CEO’s signature on a one-page amendment that, without adequate disclosure, changed the choice-of-law provision from New York to Delaware and was dated October 14, 2021 (the date of the New York Court of Appeals decision in Adar Bays). On November 15, 2021, FirstFire submitted a conversion notice for the full debt plus interest ($886,875) using the $0.005 default price; on November 17, 2021, the transfer agent issued 177,375,000 freely trading shares while the stock allegedly traded at $0.1334/share (estimated value about $23.7 million). DarkPulse disputes it was in default and alleges FirstFire sued in Delaware Chancery to validate the default pricing and seek further penalties.\n\nThe complaint’s core theory is not a traditional investor-fraud theory on behalf of purchasers of DarkPulse stock. Rather, DarkPulse (the issuer/borrower) alleges: (a) FirstFire’s business model constitutes “dealer” activity requiring registration under Exchange Act § 15(a); (b) because FirstFire was unregistered, the notes/SPAs are voidable under Exchange Act § 29(b) as contracts “made” and/or “performed” in violation of the Act; (c) Fireman is liable as a control person under Exchange Act § 20(a); (d) the note terms are criminally usurious under New York law and therefore constitute “unlawful debt” for purposes of civil RICO, and Defendants collected unlawful debt by taking repayment in stock at discounted/reset prices and via commitment shares; and (e) equitable/quasi-contract remedies (unjust enrichment and constructive trust) should require return of shares/profits.\n\nKey dates alleged include: September 20, 2018 (first note transaction); June 7, 2019 through February 18, 2021 (18 conversions under the first note); April 26, 2021 (second note and issuance of 60,000,000 commitment shares); October 14, 2021 (Adar Bays decision and date on the later amendment); October 26, 2021 (restriction expiration); November 4, 2021 (meeting/amendment signed); November 15, 2021 (conversion notice); November 17, 2021 (transfer agent issues 177,375,000 shares).\n\nThe causes of action pleaded are: (Count I) rescission/voiding under Exchange Act § 29(b) based on § 15(a) violation at contract formation (“made” in violation); (Count II) rescission/voiding under § 29(b) based on § 15(a) violation in performance (conversions/sales); (Count III) Exchange Act § 20(a) control-person liability against Fireman predicated on Counts I–II; (Count IV) civil RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), based on collection of “unlawful debt” (New York criminal usury); (Count V) unjust enrichment; and (Count VI) constructive trust. The complaint also seeks declaratory relief and rescissionary remedies, including return/cancellation of shares and disgorgement-like relief.\n\nAlthough the user describes the matter as a “securities class action,” the complaint text provided pleads issuer-side claims by DarkPulse and does not plead a purchaser class, a class period, reliance, or market-fraud elements typical of Section 10(b) claims. The operative “period” described is the timeframe of the two financings and subsequent conversions (September 2018 through at least November 2021).",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 29(b) provides a private right to seek rescission of a contract made in violation of the Exchange Act or whose performance involves such a violation. To plead a § 29(b) claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) that the contract involves a prohibited transaction or was made in violation of the Exchange Act or rules; (3) that the plaintiff is in contractual privity (or otherwise has standing under the governing circuit’s approach); and (4) that the plaintiff seeks rescission (and can tender/restore consideration as equity requires). When the alleged predicate violation is § 15(a), plaintiff must plausibly allege the defendant was a “dealer” (as opposed to a mere “trader” or investor) and used interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities without registration.\n\nApplication. The complaint pleads two written note/SPA contracts between DarkPulse and FirstFire. It plausibly alleges the notes are “securities” and the transactions are “transactions in securities.” It further pleads that FirstFire (i) repeatedly engages in a regular business of acquiring convertible notes from numerous microcap issuers, (ii) routinely converts into newly issued shares at discounts/reset prices, and (iii) sells those shares into the public market for its own account, generating profits from the spread/markup. Those allegations plausibly support “dealer” status under the Exchange Act’s functional test (regularity of participation, holding itself out, and profiting from trading spreads rather than long-term investment intent). The complaint also pleads interstate commerce use (website, wires, email/telephone) and that FirstFire was not registered.\n\nAt the pleading stage, Defendants’ likely counterarguments (e.g., that FirstFire is merely a private fund/investor; that issuer-side counterparties are not within the protected class; that § 15(a) is enforceable only by the SEC; or that § 29(b) relief is unavailable) do not defeat plausibility. Courts have recognized § 29(b) rescission claims predicated on § 15(a) failures where the plaintiff alleges dealer-like activity and privity. The complaint also pleads rescissionary relief consistent with § 29(b).\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Section 29(b) also reaches contracts whose performance “involves” a violation of the Exchange Act or the continuance of a violative practice. The plaintiff must plausibly allege that performance of the specific contract required or necessarily involved the unlawful conduct, not merely that unlawful conduct occurred in parallel.\n\nApplication. The complaint alleges that performance of the notes necessarily involved FirstFire’s exercise of conversion rights (debt-for-equity exchanges) and subsequent sales of the conversion shares into the market, and that each conversion/sale constituted securities transactions effected by an unregistered dealer using interstate commerce. The complaint provides detailed conversion dates, amounts of debt converted, and shares issued, and alleges immediate market dumping consistent with the business model. These factual allegations plausibly plead that the contracts’ performance involved the alleged § 15(a) violation.\n\nDefendants may argue that conversion and resale were optional, not required, and thus performance did not “involve” a violation. At the pleading stage, however, the complaint plausibly alleges the conversion-and-resale mechanism is the economic heart of the contracts and the means by which FirstFire conducted its regular dealer-like business, making the alleged § 15(a) violation sufficiently tied to performance to support § 29(b) relief.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead § 20(a) liability, a plaintiff must allege (1) a primary violation of the Exchange Act by the controlled person/entity; (2) control by the defendant over the primary violator; and (3) culpable participation (in circuits requiring it) or at least facts supporting that the control person had the power to direct the management and policies of the primary violator and was a meaningful participant in the alleged misconduct. A control person may avoid liability by pleading/proving good faith and lack of inducement, but that is generally not resolved on a motion to dismiss unless the complaint itself establishes the defense.\n\nApplication. Because Counts I and II (primary violations via § 29(b) predicated on § 15(a)) survive, the complaint adequately pleads a primary violation for § 20(a) purposes. The complaint alleges Fireman was the managing member/controller of FirstFire and related entities; personally negotiated terms; signed the contracts; directed conversions/sales; and procured the alleged choice-of-law amendment timed to Adar Bays. These allegations plausibly plead control and participation.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count III."

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. A civil RICO claim under § 1962(c) requires allegations of (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt, plus (4) injury to business or property (5) by reason of the RICO violation (proximate causation). Where the theory is “collection of unlawful debt,” plaintiff must plausibly allege a debt (a) incurred in connection with the business of lending money at a usurious rate, (b) which is unenforceable under state or federal usury laws, and (c) which was incurred at an interest rate at least twice the enforceable rate. The complaint must also satisfy Rule 8 plausibility; and to the extent it relies on fraudulent concealment (e.g., the amendment), Rule 9(b) may apply to those particular averments.\n\nApplication. The complaint’s RICO theory depends on treating the conversion discount, OID, and commitment shares as “interest” under New York criminal usury law, and then asserting the resulting APR exceeded twice the legal rate. Even assuming New York usury principles apply and that certain equity-linked consideration can be treated as interest (as discussed in Adar Bays), the complaint does not plausibly plead the key RICO “unlawful debt” predicates with the precision necessary to show the debt was unenforceable for criminal usury and incurred at twice the enforceable rate.\n\nFirst, the complaint’s APR calculations are conclusory and appear to add disparate components (stated interest, OID, conversion discount, and commitment-share value) without pleading nonconclusory facts showing how each component qualifies as “interest” for criminal usury purposes on these specific instruments, and without pleading the necessary valuation methodology at the time of contracting (including volatility/contingency and whether the conversion feature’s value is sufficiently ascertainable at inception). Adar Bays recognizes that a conversion option’s value may be considered, but it does not eliminate the requirement to plead a plausible valuation and to address contingencies.\n\nSecond, the complaint pleads that the April 2021 note had a fixed conversion price ($0.015) that would reset to $0.005 only upon default, and it alleges a dispute over whether a default occurred. For RICO “unlawful debt,” the debt must be unenforceable under usury law as incurred; where the usury theory depends materially on a contingent default reset and disputed default, the complaint must plead facts making it plausible that the usurious rate was charged/taken/received as interest within the meaning of NY Penal Law § 190.40, not merely that the lender later asserted a default price.\n\nThird, the complaint’s “enterprise” allegations are also deficient. It alleges “FirstFire Lending Enterprise” essentially as FirstFire plus Fireman, but does not plausibly plead an enterprise distinct from the person (where required) or facts showing an association-in-fact enterprise with a structure and existence beyond the alleged predicate acts. The pleadings largely collapse the enterprise into the defendant entity and its principal.\n\nFourth, causation and injury are pleaded in broad strokes (dilution, price depression, inability to raise funds) without nonconclusory allegations tying those damages to the RICO violation (collection of unlawful debt) as opposed to ordinary consequences of dilutive financing and market trading.\n\nFor these reasons, Count IV is dismissed. Dismissal is without prejudice to replead if plaintiff can allege a plausible usury/unlawful-debt theory with adequate valuation facts and enterprise/cause allegations."

          "claim": "Count V — Unjust enrichment (state law)",
          "ruling": "dismissed_in_part",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Under New York law (as most plausibly implicated by the pleadings), unjust enrichment requires (1) defendant was enriched, (2) at plaintiff’s expense, and (3) equity and good conscience require restitution. However, unjust enrichment is generally unavailable where the parties’ relationship is governed by a valid, enforceable contract covering the subject matter. It may be pleaded in the alternative at the motion-to-dismiss stage where contract validity is genuinely in dispute.\n\nApplication. The complaint alleges FirstFire was enriched by receiving and selling large quantities of DarkPulse shares obtained via the notes’ conversion mechanisms and commitment shares. It also alleges the contracts are void/voidable under Exchange Act § 29(b) due to § 15(a) violations. Because the Court sustains the § 29(b) rescission claims, the complaint plausibly places contract enforceability/voidability at issue such that quasi-contract may be pleaded in the alternative at this stage.\n\nBut the complaint’s unjust enrichment count is impermissibly overbroad to the extent it seeks to recover benefits that are expressly governed by the parties’ written agreements and to the extent it duplicates the rescissionary remedy sought under § 29(b) without identifying any enrichment independent of the contractual exchange. Equity-based restitution may be available as an incident of rescission, but an independent unjust enrichment claim is not sustained insofar as it is merely a repackaging of contract remedies while simultaneously relying on the contracts’ terms.\n\nAccordingly, the motion is granted in part and denied in part: the unjust enrichment claim is dismissed to the extent it is predicated on enforcing or re-allocating contractual consideration under valid contracts, but it is sustained as an alternative restitutionary theory contingent on plaintiff prevailing on its contract-voiding/rescission theory under § 29(b)."

          "claim": "Count VI — Constructive trust (state law equitable remedy)",
          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. A constructive trust is an equitable remedy, not an independent cause of action in many jurisdictions, and under New York law typically requires allegations of (1) a confidential or fiduciary relationship, (2) a promise, (3) a transfer in reliance on the promise, and (4) unjust enrichment. Courts may relax these elements, but the remedy is generally reserved for situations involving a special relationship and wrongful retention of specific property.\n\nApplication. The complaint does not plausibly allege a confidential or fiduciary relationship between a microcap issuer and an arm’s-length lender/counterparty in a negotiated financing. The alleged conduct (predatory terms, unregistered dealer status, and disputed amendment) may support statutory rescission and restitution, but it does not convert the relationship into the type that supports a constructive trust. In addition, the complaint seeks a constructive trust over broadly defined categories of shares/proceeds without adequately tracing specific identifiable property currently held by defendants (as opposed to proceeds already sold into the market).\n\nBecause constructive trust is not plausibly pleaded as a standalone claim on these facts, Count VI is dismissed. Plaintiff may pursue equitable restitutionary relief through § 29(b) rescission and, to the extent sustained, alternative unjust enrichment."

      "summary": "This putative securities-fraud class action is brought by four institutional lead plaintiffs—Handelsbanken Fonder AB, the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, the State of Rhode Island (Employees’ Retirement System), and the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund—on behalf of purchasers of Wells Fargo & Co. (“Wells Fargo” or the “Bank”) common stock during the alleged class period.\n\nDefendants are Wells Fargo and certain senior executives/directors (the “Insider Defendants”), principally: Timothy J. Sloan (CEO/President through March 2019; also director), John R. Shrewsberry (CFO), C. Allen Parker (General Counsel; interim CEO March–Oct. 2019), and Elizabeth “Betsy” Duke (Board Chair; director; regulator liaison). The complaint also describes Charles Scharf (CEO from Oct. 2019) but Count I is pleaded against Wells Fargo, Sloan, Parker, Duke, and Shrewsberry.\n\nThe alleged fraud centers on Wells Fargo’s public statements about its compliance with, and progress under, a set of punitive regulatory consent orders imposed in 2018 by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the CFPB (collectively, the “2018 Consent Orders”). The Federal Reserve’s 2018 consent order imposed an unprecedented “asset cap” restricting Wells Fargo’s balance-sheet growth until the Bank completed a three-stage remediation process: (1) submission and regulator approval of acceptable written plans (“Stage 1”); (2) implementation/execution of approved plans (“Stage 2”); and (3) independent third-party validation (“Stage 3”). The OCC/CFPB orders similarly required acceptable Stage 1 plans, then execution and validation.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that throughout the class period defendants repeatedly represented to investors that Wells Fargo had “plans in place,” was “executing” or “implementing” those plans, was “in compliance,” and was on track to have the asset cap lifted within stated timeframes. According to the complaint, these statements were materially false and misleading because, internally and in regulator communications, Wells Fargo had not cleared Stage 1: the Regulators repeatedly rejected Wells Fargo’s Stage 1 submissions as “materially incomplete,” lacking “substance and detail,” containing “pervasive inaccuracies,” and reflecting “illogical timeframes”—in the Regulators’ view sometimes amounting to a “plan for a plan.” Plaintiffs allege defendants received a “steady stream” of rejection letters, meeting feedback, and rebukes, including warnings of possible additional enforcement action.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity and scienter include: (i) specific rejection letters, including the Federal Reserve’s May 7, 2018 rejection of the April 3, 2018 Stage 1 submission as “materially incomplete,” and the Federal Reserve’s March 11, 2019 rejection of a revised Stage 1 plan as still “materially incomplete,” with “pervasive inaccuracies” and a warning that a third failure could prompt “additional actions”; (ii) the OCC’s July 24, 2018 rejection for lack of “substance and detail,” and a November 21, 2018 rejection of a remediation plan as “not adequately supported”; (iii) internal board emails acknowledging the submission “totally biffed it” and that investors would find the failure “completely unacceptable”; (iv) repeated extension requests to regulators for Stage 1 submissions; (v) allegations that Sloan and Duke “toned down” draft proxy disclosures in March 2019 to avoid revealing that the Bank was “not close to lifting of the asset cap,” including removing language that a “substantial amount of work” remained; (vi) allegations that Sloan gave “inaccurate and misleading” testimony to Congress on March 12, 2019 about compliance and later privately apologized to the Federal Reserve; and (vii) subsequent public admissions by new management (including Scharf) that substantial work remained.\n\nThe complaint pleads market focus and materiality by emphasizing the centrality of the asset cap to Wells Fargo’s earnings and valuation, and cites analyst reports and market reactions. It alleges a series of partial corrective disclosures and risk materializations from January 2019 through March 2020, including: (1) January 15, 2019 earnings call extending expected duration of the asset cap through end of 2019; (2) April 12, 2019 statements withdrawing guidance and acknowledging “substantial” work remained; (3) January 14, 2020 earnings call admissions by Scharf that the Bank had “a great deal” of work left and had not addressed shortcomings; and (4) March 2020 House Financial Services Committee reports and hearings, board resignations, and related disclosures, after which the stock declined sharply. Plaintiffs allege more than $54 billion in market capitalization was lost as the truth emerged.\n\nLegal claims asserted are: (Count I) violations of Exchange Act §10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against Wells Fargo, Sloan, Parker, Duke, and Shrewsberry; and (Count II) control-person liability under Exchange Act §20(a) against the Insider Defendants.\n\nThe alleged class period is February 2, 2018 through March 12, 2020, inclusive.

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 (against Wells Fargo, Sloan, Parker, Duke, Shrewsberry)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must plausibly allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity must be pleaded with particularity, and scienter must be pleaded with facts giving rise to a strong inference that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission. The complaint identifies numerous specific statements by named speakers (Sloan, Shrewsberry, Parker, Duke) in earnings calls, investor conferences, media interviews, and congressional testimony, and alleges why each was false or misleading when made. The core theory is not mere “regulatory risk” or generalized optimism; it is that defendants affirmatively represented (or implied) that Wells Fargo had regulator-approved plans and was executing/implementing them—i.e., that the Bank had progressed beyond Stage 1—while contemporaneous regulator communications repeatedly rejected Stage 1 submissions as incomplete and unacceptable.\n\nAt the pleading stage, plaintiffs adequately allege falsity in two ways: (a) by pleading the content and timing of specific rejection letters and regulator feedback (e.g., May 7, 2018 and March 11, 2019 Federal Reserve rejections; July 24, 2018 and November 21, 2018 OCC rejections) that directly contradict public assertions of being in “execution/implementation” or having “plans in place”; and (b) by alleging internal admissions (board emails and regulator-relations communications) acknowledging the submissions were deficient and not approved. These allegations plausibly support that statements about being “in compliance,” “executing,” “implementing,” or that investors knew “everything material,” were misleading because they omitted the critical fact that Stage 1 approval had not been obtained and that regulators had rejected the submissions.\n\nMateriality is plausibly alleged. The asset cap and consent-order compliance were repeatedly described as central to Wells Fargo’s financial performance and growth; analysts and investors asked directly about timing and progress; and the complaint pleads that disclosure of rejections and lack of Stage 1 approval would significantly alter the total mix of information. At this stage, the Court cannot hold as a matter of law that the alleged misstatements were immaterial puffery. Many challenged statements are concrete representations about regulatory status (approval, compliance, execution stage) and timing, not vague corporate optimism.\n\nTo the extent some statements are forward-looking (e.g., projected timing for lifting the asset cap), plaintiffs plausibly plead they were misleading because defendants allegedly lacked a reasonable basis given repeated Stage 1 rejections and extension requests, and the complaint pleads facts supporting actual knowledge of contrary information. The PSLRA safe harbor does not warrant dismissal on this record because plaintiffs allege both (i) contemporaneous facts undermining the projections and (ii) knowing misstatements, which, if proven, would defeat safe-harbor protection.\n\n2. Scienter. Plaintiffs plead a strong inference of scienter as to the individual defendants named in Count I. The complaint alleges that key rejection letters were addressed to Sloan and Duke; that senior executives and the Board were repeatedly briefed; that Duke served as chair and regulator point of contact; and that Shrewsberry and Parker were involved in regulator interactions and public communications. The allegations include: repeated written rejections; explicit warnings of further enforcement action; internal board emails acknowledging failure; repeated extension requests; and alleged active concealment (editing proxy disclosures to remove “substantial” work remaining). Sloan’s alleged private apology to the Federal Reserve for mischaracterizations further supports an inference of consciousness of wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering these allegations holistically, the inference that defendants knowingly or recklessly misled investors about the Bank’s stage of compliance and regulator approval is at least as compelling as innocent explanations (e.g., misunderstanding of regulatory “stages” or mere corporate optimism). At the pleading stage, the PSLRA’s “strong inference” requirement is satisfied.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption (Basic) and also plead omissions (Affiliated Ute). Wells Fargo stock traded on the NYSE in an alleged efficient market with analyst coverage and prompt price reaction. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, these allegations suffice to plead reliance.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead a series of alleged corrective disclosures and/or materializations of the concealed risk, with associated stock-price declines, including January 15, 2019 (asset-cap extension), April 12, 2019 (withdrawal of timing guidance and acknowledgment of substantial work), January 14, 2020 (admissions of significant remaining work and underperformance), and March 2020 (House reports, hearings, resignations, and related revelations). While defendants may later contest whether broader market forces contributed to the declines—particularly in March 2020—loss causation is a fact-intensive inquiry, and the complaint plausibly alleges that the disclosures revealed the truth about the lack of Stage 1 approval and the extent of noncompliance, thereby removing inflation. At this stage, plaintiffs need not disaggregate losses with precision.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a §20(a) claim, plaintiffs must plausibly allege: (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person; and (2) that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. Many courts also require culpable participation, though the precise formulation varies by circuit; at the pleading stage, allegations of control coupled with particularized allegations tying the defendant to the challenged statements typically suffice.\n\n1. Primary violation. Because the §10(b) claim survives, plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a predicate primary violation by Wells Fargo.\n\n2. Control. The complaint alleges that Sloan (CEO/director), Shrewsberry (CFO), Parker (GC/interim CEO/director), and Duke (Board Chair/director/regulator liaison) had authority over Wells Fargo’s public statements and disclosures and were involved in communications with regulators and oversight of consent-order compliance. These allegations plausibly plead control over the company and over the alleged misstatements.\n\n3. Culpable participation / scienter-related allegations. Even assuming culpable participation is required, the complaint pleads facts supporting it: receipt of rejection letters, repeated regulator rebukes, internal acknowledgments, extension requests, and alleged intentional “toning down” of proxy disclosures. Those allegations plausibly support that the Insider Defendants were not merely passive officers/directors but were involved in, or at least recklessly disregarded, the dissemination of misleading statements.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Steven Christiansen brings this putative securities-fraud class action on behalf of all purchasers of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum”) common stock during March 17, 2022 through September 22, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Defendants are (1) Spectrum; (2) Thomas J. Riga, Spectrum’s President/CEO and director; (3) Francois J. Lebel, EVP and Chief Medical Officer; and (4) Nora E. Brennan, EVP and CFO (and former director).\n\nThe complaint centers on Spectrum’s efforts to obtain FDA Accelerated Approval (“AA”) for poziotinib (“pozi”), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for previously treated non-small cell lung cancer with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Spectrum sought AA for a 16 mg once-daily (“16 mg QD”) dose based primarily on Phase 2 “Cohort 2” data, while proposing to run a required postmarketing confirmatory Phase 3 trial (the “PINNACLE Study”) at a different regimen, 8 mg twice daily (“8 mg BID”). The complaint alleges that, before and throughout the Class Period, the FDA repeatedly told Spectrum (including Riga and/or Lebel) that Spectrum’s dose-optimization data were inadequate; that additional data/studies were needed to justify the 16 mg QD AA dose and to support the 8 mg BID confirmatory-trial regimen; that the efficacy was marginal and not superior to available therapies; that toxicity was high; and that proceeding with an incongruent confirmatory-trial dose was “at [Spectrum’s] own risk.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Plaintiff alleges Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors about (i) dose optimization and FDA alignment, and (ii) the status of PINNACLE enrollment, while Spectrum—allegedly cash-constrained—sold substantial amounts of stock through an at-the-market (“ATM”) program and certain insiders sold small amounts.\n\nKey alleged misstatements/omissions include:\n- March 17, 2022 earnings call: Riga stated Spectrum had “learned to optimize” tolerability/adverse events with BID dosing, creating the impression dosing was optimized, when (per the complaint) the FDA had repeatedly said the dosing data were inadequate.\n- May 12, 2022 press release and earnings call: Defendants described PINNACLE as initiated and represented “Patients are being randomized” to 8 mg BID vs docetaxel, and Riga stated Spectrum was “obviously aligned with FDA” on the confirmatory study dosing/design. Plaintiff alleges these statements were false because, as of May 12, 2022, no patients had enrolled, and the FDA had not agreed to the 8 mg BID design and warned Spectrum it was proceeding at its own risk.\n- May 12, 2022 and August 12, 2022 Forms 10-Q: Defendants included generic risk disclosures that trials “may be delayed,” but (per the complaint) failed to disclose that the risk had already materialized: PINNACLE had enrolled no patients and FDA had expressed concern about delayed enrollment; and failed to disclose known uncertainties under Item 303 (dose optimization deficiencies, lack of FDA agreement on confirmatory-trial design, and the absence of enrollment).\n- June 16, 2022 investor conference: Riga stated Spectrum was on “the cusp” of FDA approvals, allegedly misleading given the FDA’s communicated concerns and PINNACLE’s non-enrollment.\n- August 11, 2022 press release and earnings call: Defendants again stated “Patients are being randomized” and described the confirmatory study as “underway.” When asked about enrollment, Lebel declined to provide numbers and spoke as though active enrollment efforts were progressing; Plaintiff alleges this was misleading because no patients had enrolled and FDA concerns persisted.\n\nThe alleged corrective disclosures occurred in two steps. First, on September 20, 2022, the FDA released its ODAC briefing document ahead of a September 22, 2022 ODAC meeting. The briefing materials disclosed (as characterized in the complaint) that FDA had long-standing, reiterated concerns about dose optimization, efficacy, and toxicity; that FDA had not reached agreement on the 8 mg BID confirmatory-trial dose; and that PINNACLE had not enrolled any patients. Spectrum’s stock allegedly fell from $1.06 (Sept. 19) to $0.66 (Sept. 20) (about -37%). Second, at the September 22, 2022 ODAC meeting (in which Lebel participated), FDA officials publicly stated there was no formal agreement on 8 mg BID and that proceeding was at Spectrum’s risk; Lebel acknowledged no patients were enrolled; and ODAC voted 9–4 that benefits did not outweigh risks. When trading resumed September 23, 2022, the stock fell from $0.63 (Sept. 21) to $0.43 (Sept. 23) (about -31%).\n\nThe complaint also alleges motive and opportunity, emphasizing Spectrum’s precarious cash position and ATM sales during the Class Period (alleged proceeds of roughly $9.4 million from at least 10.7 million shares sold during the Class Period; additional ATM sales may have occurred after the Class Period). It alleges small insider sales by Lebel (15,335 shares total; about $14,000) and Brennan (3,569 shares; about $2,819).\n\nLegal claims asserted are: (Count I) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; and (Count II) Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Individual Defendants. Significant dates include: NDA submission completed Nov. 24, 2021; FDA accepted NDA Feb. 11, 2022 with PDUFA date Nov. 24, 2022; alleged misstatements on March 17, 2022, May 12, 2022, June 16, 2022, and August 11–12, 2022; FDA briefing document Sept. 20, 2022; ODAC meeting Sept. 22, 2022; stock drop on Sept. 20 and Sept. 23, 2022; CRL issued Nov. 25, 2022; Lebel resigned effective Dec. 31, 2022.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 (against Spectrum, Riga, Lebel, Brennan)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiff must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005). Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), Plaintiff must plead falsity with particularity and must “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference” of scienter. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)–(2). At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court accepts well-pleaded factual allegations as true and considers whether the inference of scienter is at least as compelling as any opposing inference. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007).\n\n1) Material misrepresentation/omission. The complaint pleads multiple specific, time-stamped, speaker-identified statements in press releases, earnings calls, and SEC filings. Two categories are central: (a) statements conveying that Spectrum had “learned to optimize” dosing and was aligned with FDA on confirmatory-trial dosing/design; and (b) statements that “patients are being randomized” into PINNACLE and that the confirmatory study was underway/in progress.\n\nFalsity is plausibly pleaded. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to “patients are being randomized” and similar language on May 12 and August 11, 2022, PINNACLE had enrolled zero patients through at least September 2022, and that this fact was later confirmed publicly at ODAC and in FDA materials. At the pleading stage, alleging “no patients enrolled” directly contradicts “patients are being randomized” and is not mere dispute over optimism or interpretation.\n\nSimilarly, Plaintiff plausibly pleads that Riga’s “obviously aligned with FDA” statement and related dose-optimization representations were misleading because the FDA had repeatedly communicated the opposite—no formal agreement on 8 mg BID, inadequate dose-optimization data, and warnings that proceeding was at Spectrum’s own risk. The complaint supports this with detailed allegations about FDA meetings (including dates and described content) and later-confirming public statements in FDA briefing materials and ODAC transcripts. Those allegations are sufficient at this stage to plead that Defendants’ statements created a materially misleading impression of regulatory alignment and readiness.\n\nMateriality is plausibly pleaded. Whether PINNACLE had enrolled any patients, and whether FDA agreement existed on the confirmatory-trial dose/design, are the kind of facts a reasonable investor would consider important in valuing a small biopharma company whose valuation depended heavily on an AA decision and the feasibility/timeliness of the required confirmatory trial. The complaint also alleges analyst reports were influenced by the challenged statements, supporting materiality.\n\nTo the extent Defendants argue statements were puffery or non-actionable opinion, the Court disagrees at this stage as to the core allegations. “Patients are being randomized” is a concrete, present-tense statement of operational fact. Likewise, “aligned with FDA” in the context of a specific confirmatory-trial design and dose is not generic corporate optimism; it conveys a specific state of regulatory concurrence.\n\n2) Scienter. The complaint adequately pleads a strong inference of scienter as to Riga and Lebel, and, at this stage, as to Brennan for the statements/omissions tied to filings she signed and the August 2022 communications.\n\nAs to Riga and Lebel: the subject matter—FDA interactions and the status of the pivotal confirmatory trial for the Company’s lead program—goes to Spectrum’s core operations. The complaint alleges multiple FDA meetings (pre- and during the Class Period) where FDA concerns were communicated directly to Riga and/or Lebel, including that FDA did not agree to the 8 mg BID regimen and that PINNACLE enrollment was delayed. If those meetings occurred as alleged, Riga’s and Lebel’s later public statements suggesting alignment and active randomization support at least a strong inference of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\n\nMotive allegations (cash constraints, going-concern issues, and ATM equity sales during the Class Period) further support scienter, particularly as to Spectrum and Riga (who allegedly authorized ATM placements). While generalized motives to raise capital are not alone sufficient, here they are coupled with particularized allegations of contradictory internal information from the FDA and specific misstatements about enrollment.\n\nAs to Brennan: her role begins mid-Class Period (appointed May 2022, effective May 25). The complaint alleges she signed the Q2 2022 10-Q and participated in the August 11, 2022 call and disclosures. The scienter case against her is comparatively weaker than against Riga and Lebel, but at the pleading stage Plaintiff has alleged that the “patients are being randomized” language was repeated in August 2022 disclosures when, allegedly, no patients had enrolled, and that FDA concerns and the non-enrollment were known within senior management. Given her CFO role, signature on filings, and alleged participation in the communications, Plaintiff plausibly pleads at least reckless disregard.\n\n3) Reliance. Plaintiff pleads reliance via the fraud-on-the-market presumption (Basic Inc. v. Levinson) based on NASDAQ trading, analyst coverage, and market efficiency allegations. At the pleading stage, those allegations suffice.\n\n4) Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiff pleads two corrective-disclosure events: the September 20, 2022 FDA briefing document and the September 22, 2022 ODAC meeting/September 23 market reaction. The complaint alleges the disclosures revealed the truth about dose-optimization deficiencies, lack of FDA agreement, and zero enrollment, and ties those revelations to significant stock drops. That is sufficient under Dura and subsequent circuit authority to plead loss causation.\n\n5) Corporate liability. Because the complaint plausibly alleges actionable misstatements by senior officers within the scope of their duties, it adequately pleads Spectrum’s primary liability.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim."

At the pleading stage, allegations that the individual defendants had power to control the company’s public statements and participated in the challenged disclosures generally suffice.\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Court sustains the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim against Spectrum, the first element is satisfied.\n\nControl. The complaint alleges Riga was CEO and a director, Lebel was EVP/CMO and the key executive interfacing with FDA on pozi, and Brennan was CFO and an executive officer who signed SEC filings. It further alleges they had the power and authority to control the content of SEC filings, press releases, and investor communications, and that they in fact participated in the challenged statements.\n\nCulpable participation.

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Genesee County Employees’ Retirement System brings this putative securities-fraud class action on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired DocGo Inc. (“DocGo”) common stock during the alleged Class Period, asserting claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.\n\nParties. DocGo (NASDAQ: DCGO) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, providing medical transportation and mobile health services. The individual defendants are: (1) Stan Vashovsky, DocGo co-founder, CEO until January 2023, and Board Chairman; (2) Anthony Capone, former President and later CEO (January 2023 through September 2023); and (3) Andre Oberholzer, CFO through January 2023 and thereafter Treasurer/EVP.\n\nAlleged fraudulent conduct. The complaint alleges defendants engaged in a scheme to inflate DocGo’s stock price by repeatedly making false and misleading statements (and omissions) about (a) Capone’s educational credentials and role as the architect of DocGo’s proprietary AI platform, and (b) DocGo’s government-contract prospects and related revenue opportunities—particularly a purported multi-billion-dollar U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) contract and purported enrollment of migrants into New York State Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity.\n\n1) Capone’s credentials / AI narrative. DocGo marketed itself as a technology company whose “proprietary AI platform” was a key differentiator. Capone and the Company allegedly tied that differentiation to Capone’s supposed graduate education in “computational learning theory” (a subset of AI) and represented in multiple venues and SEC filings that Capone held an M.S. in Computer Science from Clarkson University and an undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam. The complaint alleges these statements were false because Capone never earned any master’s degree and never enrolled in a graduate program at Clarkson; it further alleges he did not have the represented undergraduate credentials. The alleged misstatements appeared in, among other places, (i) DocGo proxy statements (April 29, 2022 and April 26, 2023), (ii) a Form 8-K announcing Capone’s CEO appointment (November 7, 2022, signed by Oberholzer), (iii) DocGo website biographies, and (iv) repeated investor-conference remarks by Capone (e.g., September 13–14, 2022; January 12, 2023; March 7 and March 15, 2023; August 9, 2023).\n\n2) Migrant-services contract and CBP contract value. As COVID-related demand waned, DocGo sought larger non-COVID government contracts. In May 2023, DocGo obtained a controversial $432 million no-bid contract with NYC’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (“HPD”) to provide services to migrants. The complaint alleges that after negative publicity and scrutiny regarding DocGo’s performance under the HPD contract, Capone attempted to reassure investors by claiming DocGo was positioned to win a CBP border-services RFP that he described as a five-year contract “worth over $4 billion” (nearly $1 billion per year). The complaint alleges this was false because the contract was worth no more than approximately $2 billion and DocGo ultimately won no portion of it.\n\n3) Medicaid enrollment / UnitedHealthcare relationship. At the August 9, 2023 Canaccord conference, Capone allegedly stated DocGo had already signed up “over 3,000” asylum seekers onto New York State Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare and that this would allow DocGo to become their attributed primary care provider and generate recurring payer-vertical revenue. The complaint alleges these statements were false because DocGo did not enroll anyone in Medicaid programs and did not have a contract with UnitedHealthcare in New York.\n\nCorrective disclosures and loss causation. The alleged truth began to emerge in September 2023 through Times Union reporting: on September 10, 2023, the Times Union reported Capone’s CBP contract valuation was inflated and his Medicaid/UnitedHealthcare statements were inaccurate; DocGo’s stock allegedly fell about 10.76% (from $7.06 on September 8 to a low of $6.30 on September 11). On September 14, 2023, the Times Union reported Clarkson had no record of Capone’s graduate degree and Capone admitted he had no master’s degree. On September 15, 2023, DocGo filed an 8-K announcing Capone’s immediate resignation; the stock allegedly fell further (more than 25% to a low of $4.88 on September 18). The complaint alleges the stock declined more than 56% from a Class Period high of $11.41 on October 11, 2022 to $4.88 on September 18, 2023.\n\nClaims asserted. Count I asserts violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against DocGo and all individual defendants based on alleged material misrepresentations/omissions and a fraudulent scheme. Count II asserts control-person liability under Section 20(a) against the individual defendants (and, as pleaded, “all defendants”).\n\nClass period and significant dates. The complaint does not expressly state a single defined start date in the excerpt provided, but it alleges misstatements throughout at least September 13, 2022 through September 15, 2023, and it references a Class Period high on October 11, 2022 and corrective disclosures beginning September 10, 2023. Significant dates include: May 2023 (HPD contract awarded/effective); August 9, 2023 (Canaccord conference statements about CBP value and Medicaid sign-ups); September 10 and 14, 2023 (Times Union articles); September 15, 2023 (DocGo 8-K and Capone resignation); September 18, 2023 (stock low).",

        {
          "claim": "Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance (often via the fraud-on-the-market presumption); (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require the complaint to plead falsity with particularity and to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter that is cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.\n\n1) Material misrepresentation/omission (PSLRA/Rule 9(b)). The complaint pleads with particularity numerous statements, identifies the speaker, the forum/date, and explains why each statement was false. The alleged misstatements fall into two principal categories.\n\nFirst, Capone’s educational credentials and related AI/technology narrative: the complaint alleges DocGo and the individual defendants repeatedly represented in SEC filings (proxy statements and a Form 8-K) and investor presentations that Capone held an M.S. from Clarkson and a graduate background in computational learning theory/AI, and that this background underpinned DocGo’s proprietary AI “technology backbone.” The complaint further pleads the falsity by alleging Clarkson had no record of Capone’s enrollment or degree and that Capone admitted he had no master’s degree. At the pleading stage, those allegations are sufficiently particular and plausibly establish falsity.\n\nSecond, the CBP contract value and Medicaid/UnitedHealthcare statements: the complaint identifies the August 9, 2023 statements that the CBP RFP was “worth over $4 billion” and that DocGo had signed up “over 3,000” migrants for NY Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare. It pleads falsity by alleging CBP sources valued the contract under $2 billion and that DocGo later admitted it did not enroll anyone in Medicaid and lacked a NY contract with UnitedHealthcare. These allegations are also pleaded with sufficient specificity.\n\nMateriality. The alleged misstatements are plausibly material. Executive integrity and qualifications can be material where, as alleged here, the company affirmatively markets itself as a technology/AI-driven enterprise and repeatedly ties its claimed differentiating technology to the CEO’s purported specialized AI education. Likewise, the size and likelihood of a potential multi-year, multi-billion-dollar government contract and claimed conversion of municipal migrant work into recurring payer-vertical revenue are the type of information a reasonable investor would consider important in valuing a company of DocGo’s reported revenue scale.\n\n2) Scienter (PSLRA strong inference). The complaint adequately pleads a strong inference of scienter as to Capone. The alleged misstatements about his own degrees are not matters of mistake or complex accounting; they concern facts uniquely within his personal knowledge. The complaint alleges he repeated the degree claims across multiple investor events and allowed third-party introductions to stand uncorrected, supporting an inference of knowing falsity or, at minimum, deliberate recklessness.\n\nAs to DocGo, the complaint plausibly pleads corporate scienter through allegations that the Company, via SEC filings and official biographies, repeatedly represented Capone’s credentials and used them to promote the Company’s technology differentiation; at the pleading stage, it is plausible that senior management responsible for those statements either knew the truth or was deliberately reckless in not knowing, particularly given the centrality of the representations to the Company’s messaging.\n\nAs to Vashovsky and Oberholzer, the scienter showing is closer but sufficient at this stage. The complaint alleges they oversaw and made misstatements in formal SEC filings concerning Capone’s credentials and appointment, and that they were senior executives/directors with access to information and responsibility for public statements. While “must have known” allegations are not enough standing alone, the complaint pleads more than negligence by alleging repeated inclusion of specific degree claims in SEC filings and the Company’s public messaging about AI differentiation. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the inference that senior officers at least recklessly disregarded the truth about the CEO’s touted credentials is at least as compelling as the competing inference of mere oversight, particularly given the repeated nature of the representations and their prominence.\n\nWith respect to the CBP contract value and Medicaid enrollment statements, scienter is also plausibly pleaded as to Capone because the complaint alleges he had access to pipeline contract information and operational facts about whether DocGo enrolled anyone into Medicaid or had the asserted UnitedHealthcare relationship. The later walk-back attributed to a DocGo spokesperson supports an inference that the Company knew the statements were inaccurate.\n\n3) Reliance. The complaint pleads an efficient market for DocGo stock traded on NASDAQ and invokes Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. At this stage, that is sufficient. To the extent plaintiffs also invoke Affiliated Ute, the complaint primarily alleges affirmative misstatements; reliance is adequately supported via fraud-on-the-market.\n\n4) Loss causation and economic loss. The complaint pleads corrective disclosures on September 10 and September 14–15, 2023, followed by statistically significant price declines, and alleges those disclosures revealed the falsity of the CBP valuation, Medicaid enrollment claims, and Capone’s credentials. That suffices to plead loss causation under Dura at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To state a claim under Section 20(a), a plaintiff must plead: (1) a primary violation of the securities laws by the controlled person; (2) control of the primary violator by the defendant; and (3) the defendant’s culpable participation (in circuits requiring it) or, at minimum, plausible control coupled with the primary violation (with good-faith as an affirmative defense).\n\nPrimary violation. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is adequately pleaded, the complaint satisfies the primary-violation element.\n\nControl. The complaint plausibly alleges control by the individual defendants based on their senior roles: Vashovsky as CEO (until January 2023) and Board Chairman; Capone as President and then CEO; and Oberholzer as CFO and later Treasurer/EVP. It further alleges they had authority over DocGo’s public statements, SEC filings, and investor communications. These allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage to establish control.\n\nCulpable participation / good faith. To the extent culpable participation must be pleaded, the complaint’s allegations supporting scienter for the primary violation—particularly the repeated dissemination of false biographical and contract-related statements by senior officers—plausibly support culpable participation at this stage. Any argument that a defendant acted in good faith presents a fact-intensive defense not suitable for resolution on the pleadings.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

      "summary": "This putative securities class action is brought under (1) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Lead Plaintiff The Retirement Plan for Chicago Transit Authority Employees (“Chicago Transit”) on behalf of purchasers of Mobileye Global Inc. (“Mobileye”) Class A common stock during the alleged Class Period, and (2) the Securities Act of 1933 by additional named plaintiff Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (“Oklahoma Firefighters”) on behalf of purchasers in Mobileye’s June 2023 secondary public offering.\n\nParties. Mobileye is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Jerusalem, Israel, whose Class A common stock trades on NASDAQ under ticker “MBLY.” The individual defendants are senior executives: Amnon Shashua (co-founder, CEO, President, Director), Anat Heller (CFO until June 26, 2023), Moran Shemesh Rojansky (interim CFO June 26, 2023; CFO since Sept. 11, 2023), and Daniel Galves (Chief Communications Officer). For the Securities Act claims, the “Securities Act Defendants” are Mobileye, Shashua, and Heller.\n\nAlleged misconduct / fraud theory. The complaint alleges that Mobileye’s reported “record” EyeQ chip volumes and revenue growth during 2022–2023 were not driven by true end-market demand for ADAS chips, but by a multi-year “channel stuffing” scheme. The alleged scheme is that Mobileye used its market dominance in ADAS to impose annual minimum-quantity purchasing commitments on key Tier 1 automotive suppliers (e.g., ZF, Valeo, Aptiv, Magna), making it “impossible” for them to adjust purchases to declining demand. If Tier 1s did not order enough to satisfy the annual minimums, Mobileye allegedly shipped the remaining units late in the year regardless of need or customer objection. Plaintiffs allege Mobileye thereby shipped and recognized revenue on millions of EyeQ chips above true demand: approximately 4–5 million excess units in 2021–2022 and another 2–3 million excess units in 2023. Plaintiffs contend this inflated revenue by “hundreds of millions” and allowed Mobileye to meet or narrowly beat guidance and analyst consensus throughout 2023, while cannibalizing future demand.\n\nKey factual allegations supporting falsity and scienter. The complaint pleads (i) industry-standard supply-chain practices (EDI, forecasts, inventory reporting) that allegedly gave Mobileye continuous visibility into Tier 1 inventory and end-demand; (ii) confidential-witness allegations from a former Aptiv employee (FE1) describing non-cancellable minimum commitments, forced year-end deliveries, and Mobileye’s refusal to adjust volumes despite declining OEM demand; and (iii) confidential-witness allegations from a former Mobileye VP of ADAS Business Development (FE2) claiming excess inventory existed “across the board” by end-2022, that the decision to push inventory “went up to Amnon” (Shashua), and that the CFO attended meetings where such issues would be discussed.\n\nAlleged false statements. Plaintiffs challenge numerous statements in SEC filings, earnings calls, and conferences that allegedly conveyed (a) that Mobileye’s shipments depended on “market conditions,” (b) that Mobileye generally did not require customers to purchase minimum quantities (or that minimums were limited and a recent response to shortages), (c) that Mobileye was monitoring inventory and balancing shipments quarter-to-quarter, (d) that inventory issues were limited/stabilized and not affecting EyeQ, and (e) that Mobileye had ~70% ADAS market share. Plaintiffs also allege Mobileye’s January 2024 messaging falsely attributed excess inventory to Tier 1 “decisions” to build inventory.\n\nCorrective disclosures / loss causation. Plaintiffs allege two principal corrective events: (1) January 4, 2024: Mobileye disclosed it had become aware of “6–7 million units” of excess EyeQ inventory at customers and guided to a ~50% revenue decline in Q1 2024 and lower FY2024 revenue; MBLY fell 24.5% to $29.97. (2) August 1, 2024: Mobileye again reduced FY2024 revenue guidance to $1.6–$1.68 billion and reduced EyeQ unit guidance, citing continued weakness and incomplete visibility (including China “residual” inventory); MBLY fell 22.5% to $16.28. Plaintiffs allege an overall ~70% collapse from the class-period high.\n\nClass period and significant dates. The Exchange Act class period is alleged as January 26, 2023 through August 1, 2024, inclusive. Key dates include: October 2022 IPO/spin-off from Intel; January 26, 2023 earnings release and 2023 guidance; March 9, 2023 Form 10-K; April 27, July 27, and October 26, 2023 earnings calls; June 5–12, 2023 secondary offering (S-1 filed June 5; effective June 7; prospectus June 8; offering completed June 12); January 4, 2024 disclosure; January 25, 2024 earnings call (admitting annual commitments made it “impossible” for customers to adjust); April 25, 2024 earnings call; August 1, 2024 second guidance cut.\n\nLegal claims asserted. The complaint asserts: (Count I) Exchange Act §10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) (misstatements/omissions) against Mobileye and the executive defendants; (Count II) Exchange Act §10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) (scheme liability) against Mobileye and the executive defendants; (Count III) Exchange Act §20(a) control-person liability against the executive defendants; (Count IV) Securities Act §11 against Mobileye, Shashua, and Heller for alleged misstatements/omissions in the June 2023 offering documents; and (Count V) Securities Act §15 control-person liability against Shashua and Heller.",

          "claim": "Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) (material misstatements/omissions)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), plaintiffs must plausibly allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. The PSLRA and Rule 9(b) require particularity as to the “who, what, when, where, and how” of the alleged fraud, and the PSLRA requires facts giving rise to a “strong inference” of scienter.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission. The complaint pleads numerous specific statements in SEC filings and earnings calls during the class period that Mobileye’s shipments would “depend upon market conditions,” that Mobileye was monitoring inventory and balancing quarter-to-quarter, and that customers had substantial capacity—statements that, as pled, conveyed that reported EyeQ volumes and revenue reflected genuine demand rather than forced, non-demand-driven shipments. It also pleads specific offering/periodic-report language that Mobileye “generally” did not have contracts requiring customers to purchase set quantities and that minimum commitments were limited and driven by shortages.\n\nAt the pleading stage, plaintiffs plausibly allege falsity and misleading half-truths: the January 25, 2024 earnings call is pled as an admission that Mobileye used full-year commitments in 2022 and 2023 that made it “impossible” for customers to adjust quantities to demand. Coupled with the pleaded facts that Mobileye nonetheless repeatedly described shipment volumes as dependent on “market conditions,” and that it downplayed the extent and effect of minimum-quantity commitments, plaintiffs plausibly plead that at least some statements were misleading.\n\nMateriality is plausibly alleged. The complaint ties the challenged statements to the core of Mobileye’s business: EyeQ allegedly comprised ~90% of revenue, and the alleged channel inventory overhang and artificial revenue inflation would be important to a reasonable investor assessing growth sustainability and guidance credibility, particularly for a recently spun-off issuer. These are not immaterial “puffery” in context; statements about the basis for revenue growth, the existence/extent of binding customer commitments, and inventory alignment are capable of objective verification and plausibly material.\n\n2. Scienter. The PSLRA requires a strong inference that defendants acted intentionally or with deliberate recklessness. Plaintiffs plead multiple, mutually reinforcing scienter indicia: (i) core operations—EyeQ allegedly drives ~90% of revenue, making it plausible senior executives tracked volumes and customer ordering practices; (ii) alleged admissions in January 2024 that the annual commitments constrained customers’ ability to adjust to demand; (iii) confidential-witness accounts (FE2) alleging the inventory push “went up to Amnon” and that management meetings included the CFO; (iv) confidential-witness account (FE1) describing forced year-end deliveries and non-cancellable minimums at a major customer; (v) industry practice allegations suggesting Mobileye received frequent forecasts and inventory signals; and (vi) the alleged magnitude and persistence of the inventory buildup (6–7 million units) and the dramatic year-end volume spikes.\n\nAt this stage, taking the allegations collectively as Tellabs requires, the inference that senior management knew (or was deliberately reckless in not knowing) that reported volumes were materially inflated by forced shipments is at least as compelling as the competing inference of mere mismanagement. The complaint does not rely solely on “fraud by hindsight”; it pleads contemporaneous visibility (forecasts/EDI), customer objections, and internal escalation.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead market efficiency and invoke Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. That is sufficient at the pleading stage.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead two partial corrective disclosures (January 4, 2024 and August 1, 2024) followed by statistically large stock drops. The January 4 disclosure expressly revealed excess customer inventory and a resulting revenue collapse—facts directly tied to the alleged misstatements about demand alignment and inventory monitoring. The August 1 disclosure allegedly revealed continuing weakness and lack of visibility, contradicting prior assurances that inventory would clear quickly and guidance was stable. That suffices to plead loss causation.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count I."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) prohibit employing a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud and engaging in a fraudulent course of business. Plaintiffs must plead deceptive conduct, scienter, reliance, and loss causation. After Lorenzo, dissemination of false statements can support (a)/(c) liability, but plaintiffs must still allege conduct that is itself deceptive (not merely aiding and abetting), and must satisfy the PSLRA’s heightened pleading standards.\n\nHere, plaintiffs plead more than misstatements. They allege a course of conduct: imposing annual minimum-quantity commitments, refusing cancellations, and shipping unrequested product late in the year to satisfy commitments, thereby recognizing revenue untethered to demand and creating a concealed channel inventory overhang. At the pleading stage, this alleged “channel stuffing” is plausibly deceptive conduct because it allegedly created a misleading picture of demand-driven sales and sustainable growth, and it is pled as being concealed from investors through contemporaneous statements about shipments depending on market conditions and inventory being monitored and stabilized.\n\nScienter, reliance, and loss causation are plausibly alleged for the reasons stated with respect to Count I. The January 2024 disclosure of 6–7 million units of excess inventory and the resulting guidance collapse plausibly connects the alleged scheme to investor losses.\n\nDefendants’ argument that the conduct is merely “hard bargaining” or ordinary supply-chain contracting raises factual disputes not resolvable on a motion to dismiss where plaintiffs allege forced shipments over customer objection and concealment of the resulting inventory and revenue inflation.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count II."

Many courts also consider culpable participation, but at the pleading stage control is generally sufficient where the primary violation is adequately alleged.\n\nBecause the complaint plausibly pleads primary violations under §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against Mobileye (Counts I and II), the first element is satisfied.\n\nAs to control, the executive defendants are alleged to have held senior roles (CEO/President/Director; CFOs; Chief Communications Officer), to have participated in drafting/signing SEC filings and making earnings-call statements, and to have had authority over Mobileye’s public disclosures and operations. Those allegations plausibly plead control.\n\nAffirmative defenses (good faith/non-culpable participation) are not resolved at this stage.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count III."

Scienter is not required. Plaintiffs must plead (1) standing (purchase traceable to the offering), (2) a material misstatement/omission in the registration statement, and (3) damages; defendants may raise negative causation and due diligence as defenses.\n\nStanding/traceability is adequately pled: Oklahoma Firefighters alleges it purchased 30,115 shares directly in the June 2023 offering at $42 per share.\n\nMaterial misstatements/omissions are plausibly pled. The offering documents incorporated the March 9, 2023 Form 10-K and May 11, 2023 Form 10-Q, which allegedly stated Mobileye “generally” did not have contracts requiring customers to purchase set quantities and that volumes supplied would “depend upon market conditions,” while also suggesting minimum commitments were limited and driven by shortages. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that, by the offering date, Mobileye had already shipped 4–5 million excess EyeQ units and had minimum-commitment arrangements with customers comprising ~70% of revenue, making the “generally” characterization and the “market conditions” framing misleading absent fuller disclosure.\n\nThe complaint also plausibly alleges omissions under Regulation S-K Items 303 and 105: that known trends/uncertainties and material risks existed because excess channel inventory and binding annual commitments were reasonably likely to depress future orders and render reported revenue not indicative of future performance. At the pleading stage, plaintiffs plausibly allege these were known to management given the alleged customer forecasts/inventory visibility and the confidential-witness allegations.\n\nMateriality is plausibly alleged because the alleged practices affected the principal revenue driver (EyeQ) and the sustainability of growth.\n\nDefenses such as due diligence (for the individual signatories) and negative causation are fact-intensive and not resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to Count IV."

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action brought on behalf of purchasers of American Airlines Group Inc. (“American” or the “Company”) publicly traded securities during the alleged Class Period July 20, 2023 through May 28, 2024, inclusive. The named plaintiffs are court-appointed Co-Lead Plaintiffs Dominik Dumancic and Luis Vicente Davidoff Cracasso, and additional named plaintiff Richard Wilkinson (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). The defendants are American (Nasdaq: AAL) and three senior executives: Robert D. Isom, Jr. (CEO, President, and director), Devon E. May (CFO), and Vasu S. Raja (Chief Commercial Officer until May 28, 2024) (collectively, “Defendants”).\n\nCore theory of the case: Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period Defendants knowingly or recklessly misrepresented the success and financial effects of American’s “Modern Retailing” sales/distribution strategy—an aggressive push to move corporate and agency bookings from legacy EDIFACT/GDS channels to direct and NDC-enabled channels—while omitting that the strategy was alienating travel agencies, travel management companies (“TMCs”), and corporate customers, causing market-share losses (especially in managed corporate and close-in bookings) and materially impairing revenue. Plaintiffs allege Defendants also issued and reaffirmed false earnings guidance for 2Q 2024 and full-year 2024 that assumed the strategy was working.\n\nFactual allegations supporting falsity/misleadingness: The complaint describes American’s pre-Class Period and Class Period distribution changes, including (i) December 5, 2022 notices requiring NDC connectivity by April 2023 to access full content; (ii) April 3, 2023 removal of roughly 40% of fare content (including basic economy and certain premium products) from EDIFACT channels; and (iii) July 2023 contract changes that reduced traditional incentives/perks for agencies, TMCs, SMBs, and corporations and tied incentives to NDC adoption with allegedly unrealistic targets.\n\nPlaintiffs rely heavily on two confidential witnesses (“CW1” and “CW2”), both former American employees in sales roles, who allege that: (a) agencies/TMCs rapidly shifted share away from American beginning around June 2023; (b) corporate and agency bookings declined materially (CW2 alleges larger-agency bookings down ~15% year-over-year by July 2023 and corporate bookings “much lower”); (c) NDC adoption was poor among many agencies/TMCs; (d) American’s NDC channels lacked key functionality (e.g., duty-of-care data and servicing features), creating customer pushback; and (e) internal tools and reports (SalesLink Insights, PRISM, and IATA data) showed persistent share/bookings deterioration and were circulated upward. Plaintiffs further plead that Defendants later admitted the strategy “drove customers away,” that American “moved faster than we should,” and that the strategy caused substantial revenue harm.\n\nAlleged misstatements/omissions: Plaintiffs identify numerous statements in SEC filings (Forms 10-Q and 10-K risk factors), earnings calls, conferences, press releases, and interviews from July 20, 2023 through April 25, 2024. The alleged misstatements fall into several themes: (1) portraying NDC/Modern Retailing adoption and partner response as strong and encouraging; (2) representing business demand and corporate recovery as durable and improving; (3) asserting American was holding market share and not seeing negative customer behavior; (4) issuing/reaffirming 2Q 2024 and full-year 2024 guidance (including EPS and free cash flow) allegedly without a reasonable basis; and (5) describing distribution-related risks as hypothetical in risk factors while allegedly failing to disclose the risks had already materialized.\n\nCorrective disclosures and loss causation: Plaintiffs allege partial corrective disclosures on May 28–29, 2024. On May 28, 2024 (after market close), American announced Raja’s departure and cut 2Q 2024 guidance (operating margin, EPS, TRASM expectations). On May 29, 2024, at the Bernstein conference, Isom attributed “softness in customer bookings” in part to “changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy,” admitted the approach was “driving customers away,” and described reversing aspects of the strategy. American’s stock allegedly fell from $13.44 (May 28 close) to $11.62 (May 29 close). Plaintiffs also cite later disclosures on July 25, 2024 (post-Class Period) quantifying an alleged $750 million revenue impact in 1H 2024 and expected additional $750 million impact in 2H 2024.\n\nLegal claims asserted: (1) Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; and (2) Section 20(a) control-person liability against the Individual Defendants (Isom, May, Raja).",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Legal standard. To plead a private securities-fraud claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), falsity must be pled with particularity, and scienter must be pled with facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness.\n\n1. Material misrepresentation/omission. Plaintiffs plead a coherent theory that Defendants repeatedly represented that Modern Retailing/NDC execution was proceeding well, that agency/corporate response was strong, that business demand and corporate recovery were durable, and that American was holding share, while omitting that internal data allegedly showed the strategy was alienating agencies/TMCs/corporations and materially eroding bookings/share and revenue.\n\nAt the pleading stage, these allegations are sufficiently particularized. The complaint identifies the challenged statements by date, forum (10-Q/10-K risk factors, earnings calls, press releases, conferences, media interviews), speaker, and substance. It also pleads why they were allegedly false when made: CW1 and CW2 describe contemporaneous booking/share declines and poor NDC adoption; the complaint alleges internal reporting systems (SalesLink Insights, PRISM, IATA) tracked share and channel mix; and Plaintiffs plead that Defendants later admitted the strategy “drove customers away” and required reversal.\n\nDefendants’ likely arguments that many statements are puffery or immaterial optimism do not warrant wholesale dismissal at this stage. Some statements (e.g., being “pleased,” “encouraged,” “on the right path”) may be nonactionable in isolation. But Plaintiffs also plead more concrete representations—e.g., assertions about corporate volume trends, share retention, adoption levels, and guidance “implicit” in the NDC strategy—that plausibly could be material to investors evaluating American’s revenue trajectory, corporate share, and the viability of a major strategic shift. Likewise, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that risk-factor language framing harms as hypothetical could be misleading if Defendants knew the risk had already materialized.\n\n2. Scienter. The complaint adequately pleads a strong inference of scienter as to at least Raja and Isom, and plausibly as to May.\n\nThe scienter allegations are not limited to “fraud by hindsight.” Plaintiffs plead (a) access to and monitoring of specific internal metrics and reports (SalesLink Insights, PRISM, IATA) showing agency/corporate share and channel adoption; (b) the centrality of corporate/agency distribution to American’s revenue (including allegations that a substantial portion of passenger revenue was booked through channels affected by the strategy); (c) CW accounts that the deterioration was noticeable and persistent beginning in mid-2023; (d) specific late-Class Period statements (April 25, 2024 earnings call) where Raja allegedly denied pushback and claimed corporate revenues were “coming back very materially,” while Plaintiffs allege Defendants already knew of a “deviation” versus peers in 1Q 2024; and (e) post-Class Period admissions attributed to Isom that American identified the deviation in 1Q 2024 but hoped it would reverse.\n\nConsidering these allegations holistically, the inference that Defendants (at least Isom and Raja) knew or were deliberately reckless in not knowing that the distribution strategy was materially impairing corporate/agency performance is at least as compelling as the competing inference that they were merely optimistic about a difficult transition.\n\nAs to May, the allegations are somewhat thinner, but Plaintiffs plead he signed SEC filings and the May 28, 2024 8-K, participated in guidance communications, and as CFO plausibly had access to the same performance information bearing on guidance and revenue trends. At the motion-to-dismiss stage, that is sufficient to proceed against May on the primary claim, particularly where Plaintiffs’ theory is that guidance and revenue/demand statements were issued without a reasonable basis.\n\n3. Reliance. Plaintiffs plead an efficient market for AAL stock and invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption (Basic) and, alternatively, Affiliated Ute for omissions. At this stage, that is sufficient.\n\n4. Loss causation and economic loss. Plaintiffs plead a price decline following May 28–29, 2024 disclosures tying revenue softness and guidance reductions to the distribution strategy and acknowledging customer loss. They allege the stock fell materially on May 29, 2024, and cite analyst commentary attributing the decline to American-specific distribution strategy issues. This is adequate to plead loss causation.\n\n5. PSLRA safe harbor/forward-looking statements. Some challenged statements include forward-looking guidance. Plaintiffs plead that Defendants lacked a reasonable basis and/or had actual knowledge of falsity, and that cautionary language was not meaningful as to the concealed, already-materialized adverse facts. At the pleading stage, the safe harbor does not compel dismissal of the guidance-based theory.\n\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied as to the §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim."
