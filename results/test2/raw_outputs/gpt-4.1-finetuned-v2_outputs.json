      "summary": "Carvana is a self-described e-commerce company dealing in used cars. Unlike traditional dealerships, Carvana would be a seemingly limitless growth machine because the Company’s disruptive model was full of competitive advantages, such as a “capital-light” expansion model, a scalable business model, and a groundbreaking logistics network that could readily deliver or pick-up cars nationwide. After going public, Defendants continued to tout their “bigger is better” growth story. Immediately before the Class Period, however, Defendants faced a dilemma as investors were concerned that Carvana’s retail sales growth was slowing. Defendants could not let this happen; they needed the Company to have a high valuation so they could cash out their personal holdings in Carvana stock at a top dollar. Thus, Defendants planned and executed a scheme to inflate the Company’s retail vehicle sales while concealing the unsustainability of Carvana’s model and the many devastating consequences of their scheme. As the Class Period began, Defendants embarked on their scheme to inflate Carvana’s retail sales, and thus, Carvana’s stock price. While Defendants disclosed the Company’s focus on retail sales growth, Defendants concealed that it required a series of unsustainable machinations to accelerate this growth, including: (i) “frequently aquir[ing] sales that were less profitable”; (ii) abruptly escalating the number of cars purchased from customers to induce trade-ins by lowering the Company’s purchasing and verification standards, and buying “as much as was humanly possible”; (iii) launching a rapid and unsustainable nationwide expansion plan to enter over 150 new markets even though the Company lacked the necessary infrastructure to serve many of these markets; (iv) violating state title and registration laws to quickly push through sales; and (v) entering into a pass-through sales arrangement with the Garcias’ DriveTime to sell thousands of cars with no benefit to Carvana except for the boost to its reported unit sales. At the same time that Defendants inflated Carvana’s retail unit growth, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business. Specifically, Defendants exalted Carvana’s increases in retail sales and masked its actual gross profits per retail unit, while touting the efficiencies and capabilities of its groundbreaking logistics network and “capital-light” expansion model. Defendants’ assurances were aimed at convincing investors that Carvana’s growth was sustainable. After all, if Carvana could pair its explosive unit growth with purported profitability, and a scalable logistics model that could expand across the country efficiently and cost effectively, the sky was the limit. Defendants’ limitless growth story produced its desired results. Carvana’s retail sales growth skyrocketed, propelling Carvana to be named as one of the fastest companies to ever make the Fortune 500 list based on organic growth alone, along with Google and Amazon. Naturally, Carvana’s stock price soared, rising as high as $376 per share during the Class Period. And Defendants took full advantage of the artificially inflated stock price by dumping more than $3.87 billion of their personally held shares on unsuspecting investors. Garcia Senior alone reaped more than $3.6 billion in insider sales proceeds. And the music did end – with a thud. Through a series of partial disclosures, investors began to learn that Carvana was a very different company from the one they were sold. Defendants’ “bigger is better” Amazon-comparison story was a fiction. Ultimately, Defendants admitted that Carvana’s retail sales growth was unsustainable – indeed, by the end of the Class Period, retail sales were significantly declining. Defendants acknowledged that Carvana’s “capital-light” market expansion model was a farce, and Carvana was forced to issue billions of dollars of high-interest junk bonds to acquire a nationwide auction house, ADESA, to backfill its deficient infrastructure.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of all individuals and entities who purchased or sold Tesla stock, options, and other securities during the Class Period and were damaged thereby, excluding Tesla, Musk, the Board, and each Defendant’s immediate family members, legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which Tesla, Musk, or the Board have or had a controlling interest (the “Class”). The Class members are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Throughout the Class Period, Tesla’s securities were actively traded on the NASDAQ. While the exact number of Class members is unknown to Plaintiff at this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate discovery, Plaintiff believes that there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Class members. Record owners and other Class members may be identified from records maintained by Tesla or its transfer agent and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail, using the form of notice similar to that customarily used in securities class actions. At all relevant times herein, there were over 170 million shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding and hundreds of millions of dollars of other securities traded. Upon information and belief, these shares and option contracts were held by thousands of individuals located geographically throughout the country and the world. Joinder would be highly impracticable. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the Class members as all Class members were similarly affected by the Defendants’ wrongful conduct in violation of the federal securities laws complained of herein. Plaintiff bought and sold common stock and option contracts during the Class Period. The manner in which Plaintiff sustained damages in connection with each security that he held was similar, if not identical, to other Class members who purchased or sold Tesla securities. Plaintiff has and will continue to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class members. Plaintiff has retained counsel competent and experienced in class and securities litigation. Plaintiff has no interests antagonistic to or in conflict with those of the Class. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class members and predominate over any questions solely affecting individual Class members. Among the questions of law and fact common to the Class are: (a) whether the federal securities laws were violated by Defendants’ respective acts as alleged herein; (b) whether Defendants acted knowingly or with deliberate recklessness in issuing false and misleading statements concerning a proposed going-private transaction and its financing; (c) whether the price of Tesla’s securities during the Class Period were affected by Defendants’ conduct complained of herein; and (d) whether the Class members have sustained damages and, if so, what is the proper measure of damages. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is impracticable. Furthermore, as the damages suffered by individual Class members may be relatively small, the expense and burden of individual litigation make it impossible for Class members to individually redress the wrongs done to them. There will be no difficulty in the management of this action as a class action. Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles. These vehicles consist primarily of three models: the Model S luxury sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle, and the Model 3 mass market sedan. Both the Model S and Model X had experienced production difficulties after being introduced in 2012 and 2015, respectively. As the Model 3 vehicle was to be produced in greater numbers, analysts and investors closely followed Tesla’s production plans for it. On October 2, 2017, Tesla issued a press release stating that “Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.” Despite promising to deliver 1,600 Model vehicles in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it had produced only 220 of the vehicles. Musk had previously promised on February 22, 2017 that Tesla would be producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017. On November 1, 2017, in an “Update Letter” posted to its website, Tesla revealed that its manufacturing problems during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 had resulted in heavy spending in an effort to increase production. The spending resulted in wider-than-expected losses— $2.92 per share compared to the analyst consensus of $2.29 per share—and a sharp decline in the price of Tesla’s common stock from $331.53 per share to $321.08 per share. Notwithstanding its production problems, Tesla told shareholders in the November 1, 2017 “Update Letter” that it expected to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week late in the first quarter of 2018. On January 3, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that Tesla’s problems with battery production at its “Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada (where Tesla produces lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles), were worse than it had acknowledged and likely to cause further delays and quality issues for the new Model 3 vehicles. The continued production problems led Tesla to revise its previously stated production targets in a press release dated January 3, 2018. From 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Tesla told investors that it was aiming for 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of March, ramping up to 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by June. On January 25, 2018, investors received additional information about Tesla’s Model production problems when CNBC reported that Tesla’s Model 3 vehicle production was being hampered in part due to the fact that the company was still making its Model 3 vehicle batteries partly by hand and having to “borrow” scores of employees from Panasonic, which is a partner in the Gigafactory and supplies lithium-ion battery cells, to help with this manual assembly. Numerous short investors had targeted Tesla by this point in time. For example, CNBC reported in its January 25, 2018 article that Stanphyl Capital’s Mark B. Spiegel had taken a “significant short position in the company.” Spiegel told CNBC, in pertinent part, that: “While I’ve no doubt that Tesla will eventually work out its Model 3 vehicle production problems, the base model will cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build. The company will never deliver more than a token few for less than the current $49,000 lowest-cost offering. Sales will hugely disappoint relative to expectations of over 400,000 a year. And even at those higher prices Tesla will never come anywhere close to its promised [profitability].” As of January 31, 2018, the short interest in Tesla stock was approximately 30 million shares, or about 18% of Tesla’s outstanding shares. On April 3, 2018, Tesla revealed in a press release that instead of producing 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week, it was only producing just over 2,000. According to the Wall Street Journal in an article published on April 3, 2018, Musk had developed a reputation for setting “ambitious deadlines that he fail[ed] to meet on time.” As of April 3, 2018, Tesla’s short interest had grown to almost 32 million shares, or 19% of the company’s outstanding shares. On April 11, 2018, according to an article published by CNBC titled Tesla is the biggest short in the US stock market, the dollar amount of shares shorted on Tesla was $10.7 billion, or more than 25% of Tesla’s available stock. Big banks, such as Goldman Sachs, were encouraging its clients to sell their Tesla stock on the premise that the company would not be able to meet its Model 3 vehicle production targets. Musk publicly displayed his animosity towards short sellers of Tesla stock. On May 2, 2018, while participating in a conference call to discuss Tesla’s earnings for the first quarter of 2018, Musk abruptly dismissed questions from analysts. In response to a question from Sanford Bernstein senior analyst Toni Sacconaghi about Tesla’s capital requirements, Musk responded by saying “Boring, bonehead questions are not cool, Next?” In response to a question from RBC Capital Markets Joseph Spak about Model 3 vehicle reservations, Musk said, “These questions are so dry. They’re killing me.” On May 4, 2018, Musk defended his hostile behavior towards Sacconaghi and Spak, tweeting that they were just “two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis.” Later on May 4, 2018, Musk tweeted “Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.” Shortly afterwards on May 4, 2018, Musk stated, “Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit . . . .” On May 7, 2018, Musk bought about $9.85 million worth of Tesla shares in the pre-market in a manner designed have the greatest impact on Tesla’s stock price and force a burst of short-covering. On May 7, 2018, Tesla’s stock price increased from $297.50 to $302.77. Musk did this again on June 12, 2018 when he bought about $24.9 million worth of Tesla stock to maintain Tesla’s stock price despite announcing that Tesla was cutting 46,000 employees, about 9% of its workforce. On June 17, 2018, Musk tweeted that “[the shorts] have about three weeks before their short position explodes.” On July 2, 2018 and July 3, 2018, The New York Times and Bloomberg reported that Tesla finally met its production target of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week during the last seven days of June 2018. Despite Tesla’s increased Model 3 vehicle production figures, its stock price fell from $342.95 on June 29, 2018 to $310.86 on July 3, 2018. Tesla’s short interest, however, also fell by 11% from 39 million shares to 34.6 million shares. On July 22, 2018, the Wall Street Journal published a story focused on Tesla’s request to suppliers to refund a portion of its past payments. According to this report, Tesla requested its suppliers to refund “a meaningful amount of its payments since 2016” to allow it to continue its operations and continue “the long-term growth between” Tesla and its suppliers. Tesla’s requests for refunds from its suppliers raised further questions about its cash position, which had dwindled due to Model 3 vehicle production issues. Following the July 22, 2018 Wall Street Journal article, Tesla’s stock price declined from $313.58 per share to $303.20 per share. On July 24, 2018, in response to a growing short interest following the Wall Street Journal article, Musk contacted the employer of an author of an article published on SeekingAlpha and threatened to sue or complain publicly about the articles. The author, who managed a private family investment portfolio of approximately $1 billion, had published four articles titled “Just Say ‘No’ To Tesla’s Misleading Margin Metric,” “As Tesla Breaks Faith With Its Believers, It’s Time To Go Short,” “Even With Model 3 Success, Tesla Is Structurally Bankrupt,” and “Tesla Investors Swallow The Blue Pill.” Musk threatened that if the author continued to write, he would engage counsel and sue. As a result of Musk’s threats, the author immediately stopped writing at SeekingAlpha and deactivated his Twitter account. On July 30, 2018, U.S. News & World Report reported that Steve Eisman, the investor who famously predicted the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2007 and 2008 and was featured in Michael Lewis’s book The Big Short, was predicting a similar demise for Tesla. In an interview with Bloomberg, Eisman expressed the opinion that Musk had a hard time executing, despite being a “very, very smart man.” By July 31, 2018, Tesla’s short interest was back to 35 million shares, or 20% of the company’s outstanding stock. On July 31, 2018, Musk and Sam Teller, who was employed by Tesla as Director, Office of the CEO, attended a meeting with representatives of the Public Investment Fund at the “Tesla Factory” in Freemont, California, for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer, joined the meeting about halfway through. On several occasions since January 2017, the Public Investment Fund had expressed interest in exploring with Musk a going-private transaction involving Tesla, but no proposed transaction had resulted from those discussions. During the July 31, 2018 meeting, a representative of the Public Investment Fund mentioned that the fund would still be interested in exploring a going-private transaction if Tesla was prepared to build a production facility in the Middle East. No additional details or terms were discussed, including fundamental terms such as: the dollar amount to be invested; the ownership percentage for the fund if Tesla was to go private; any acquisition premium to be offered to current Tesla shareholders; any potential restrictions on foreign ownership of a significant stake in Tesla; the fund’s available liquid capital to contribute to a going-private transaction; whether the fund was experienced in going-private transactions; regulatory obstacles associated with a going-private transaction; or what, if any, approval from Tesla’s Board was needed to take Tesla private. When the July 31, 2018 meeting concluded, no legal documents had been signed, no term sheets had been executed, no advisors had been engaged, and no decision had been made with regard to the Middle East production facility. On August 1, 2018, Tesla reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2018 in an investor “Update Letter” and during an investor conference call. Tesla’s results exceeded analyst revenue expectations. In the “Update Letter” published on August 1, 2018, Tesla also affirmed production targets of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of August. Tesla’s quarterly results led to a 16% surge in the company’s stock price from $300.84 to $349.54. On August 2, 2018, after the market closed, Musk sent an email to Tesla’s Board, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel. The subject line of the email stated “Offer to Take Tesla Private at $420.” In the email, Musk explained that he wanted to take Tesla private in order to, among other reasons, avoid the “constant defamatory attacks by the short-selling community” against Tesla. Musk also asked that the “matter be put to a shareholder vote at the earliest opportunity” and advised that the “offer expires in 30 days.” At this point in time, Musk thought there was “a lot of uncertainty” regarding a potential going-private transaction and believed that the likelihood of consummating a transaction was about 50%. According to Musk, the $420 per-share price for the going-private transaction was based on a 20% premium to the closing price of Tesla’s stock on August 2, 2018, which was $349.54 per share. Musk believed that 20% was a “standard premium” in going-private transactions. Although the precise calculation equaled $419.49, Musk rounded the price up to $420 per share because he thought his girlfriend at the time, Claire Elise Boucher (also known as “Grimes”), would find it funny due to the significance of the number to marijuana users. Since Musk’s meeting with the Public Investment Fund on July 31, 2018, Tesla’s stock price had increased over 17% due to the positive earnings results announced by the company on August 1, 2018. If Musk were to have applied the 20% premium to Tesla’s stock price as of July 31, 2018 (closing price of $298.14 per share), the per-share price for the going-private transaction would have been approximately $358 per share. Accordingly, if the going-private transaction occurred at $420 per share, investors in the transaction would be paying a “premium on a spike,” which Musk realized could make the going-private transaction not feasible. Notwithstanding, Musk did not discuss the $420 per-share price with the Public Investment Fund or any other funding source for a going-private transaction prior to sending his email to Tesla’s Board on August 2, 2018. On August 3, 2018, in response to Musk’s email, the Board held a telephonic meeting at which time Musk informed the board that the Public Investment Fund was interested in funding a going-private transaction and that the fund was interested in having Tesla build a production facility in the Middle East. Concerning building a production facility in the Middle East, at least one Tesla Board member described such a condition as a “non-starter.” Musk also told the Board that he wanted Tesla’s existing investors to stay with the company. At least one Board member told Musk that it would be “really difficult for small investors” to remain shareholders if Tesla went private. Musk also asked the Board for permission to contact existing shareholders to assess their interest in participating in a going-private transaction. The Board authorized Musk to contact certain investors and report back. On August 6, 2018, Musk discussed the going-private transaction with a private equity fund partner with experience in going-private transactions. During the call, Musk stated that the number of shareholders in a private Tesla would need to be below 300, yet at the time there were over 800 institutional investors in Tesla. The private equity fund partner told Musk that the structure he was contemplating for the private company was “unprecedented” in his experience. On August 7, 2018, while driving to the airport, Musk posted the following tweet at 12:48 p.m. ET: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” At 1:00 p.m. ET, Martin Viecha, Tesla’s Senior Director of Investor Relations, sent a text message to Musk asking, “Was this text legit?” At 1:13 p.m. ET, a Tesla investor texted Teller asking, “What’s Elon’s tweet about? Can’t make any sense of it. Would be incredibly disappointing for shareholders that have stuck it out for so long.” Several minutes later, a reporter also texted Teller saying, “Quite a tweet! (Is it a joke?).” At 1:15 p.m. ET, Musk responded to another Twitter user’s question, “At what price?” by repeating “420.” At 1:40 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted, “I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.” At 2:00 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted, “My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX [a privately held company for which Musk serves as CEO] investment.” In response to this tweet another Twitter user asked, “Could we still invest once private?” Musk responded, “Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX).” At 2:07 p.m. ET, Musk responded to a Twitter user who wrote, “Or if you do take Tesla private, please have a provision for retail investors who have held Tesla shares prior to Dec 31, 2016 that those shares will"

      "summary": "Netflix is an entertainment company that operates a streaming platform that offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games across a variety of genres and languages in over 190 countries. It has one operating segment that derives revenues from monthly membership fees for streaming services. While its competitors earned revenue from advertising on their platforms or offering an ad-free plan, Netflix proudly remained free of advertising, so its revenue growth depended entirely on increasing membership. Though Netflix measured the health of its business using acquisition, retention, and engagement metrics, the one metric that was the critical focus to investors was “paid net adds,” which is the number of paid new memberships added during the reporting period minus those lost due to cancellations. While the Company offered plans to allow for multiple simultaneous streams within a household, Netflix prohibited its paying members from sharing their password with non-paying users who did not reside in their household, which is called “account sharing” or “password sharing.” At all relevant times, the Company acknowledged that account sharing existed but did not disclose any data concerning the extent of that account sharing. For years, Netflix management maintained a very permissive approach toward account sharing, claiming that sharing was not a significant problem and even a positive for the Company. In 2016, then-CFO David Wells publicly stated that account sharing was not “a material inhibitor to [Netflix’s] growth,” but acknowledged “[t]hat might not be true forever.” The first indication of a possible shift in Netflix’s posture toward account sharing occurred in 2019, when media reported that Netflix had employed software by Synamedia “to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services.” Reportedly, the software could identify when a non-paying user logs into an account based on the viewing and location habits of paying members. Netflix did not publicly acknowledge using Synamedia’s software, but management admitted that they “continue[d] to monitor” account sharing during an earnings call in October 2019. Any plans to crack down on account sharing, however, were tabled during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. As mandated lockdowns confined people to their homes, the demand for streaming entertainment services grew and Netflix experienced a surge in paid net adds. According to a former Netflix employee, an internal memo in approximately Q2’20 stated that the Company would not attempt to limit account sharing once the pandemic struck because it could be seen as exploiting the global pandemic, at a time when people were already losing so much (e.g., health, jobs, housing), and the priority was to make the service available without interruption. According to management’s public statements, the COVID-related surge in subscribers led to “a pull forward” of Netflix’s membership growth from subsequent quarters. Indeed, Netflix posted impressive results during the first half of 2020, with 15 million paid net adds in Q1’20 and 10 million paid net adds in Q2’20. Defendants predicted that the second half of 2020 would be “light” relative to prior years, and, though Q1’21 would experience some residual effect from the COVID pull-forward, this effect would “wash out” and not be “permanent or long term.” The Class Period begins on January 19, 2021 when Netflix announced its financial results for Q4’20 and issued underwhelming guidance for paid net adds in Q1’21. Because Netflix had outperformed expectations for Q4’20, an analyst questioned whether the lower-than-expected guidance reflected an undisclosed weakness. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Spencer Neumann, responded that “there’s probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021,” but flatly rejected the analyst’s contention that Netflix was saturated in the United States and Canada (“UCAN”) market. Neumann assured that in the UCAN market, Netflix was “roughly 60% penetrated, and . . . still growing.” The promise of continued growth in the UCAN market was enticing to investors because it was the Company’s most tenured market, providing the highest average revenue per member and contributing most to Netflix’s revenues. More broadly, Neumann claimed that “we’ve got a lot of headroom in all these markets” in which Netflix offered its streaming services to consumers. Notwithstanding Neumann’s representation that Netflix was only 60% penetrated into the UCAN market, the actual rate of market penetration was substantially higher due to account sharing. In addition to the roughly 74 million UCAN subscribers that Netflix reported at the time of Neumann’s statements, unbeknownst to investors, there were almost 30 million additional households that were using Netflix’s services without paying for them through account sharing. This amount vastly exceeded any of the public estimates of account sharing that had been circulated by third parties. The effective rate of market penetration in the UCAN market, therefore, was roughly 83%, making it extremely difficult for Netflix to materially increase its subscriber base. Globally, Netflix was significantly less penetrated than in the UCAN market, but extensive account sharing still caused a degree of market penetration that was substantially larger than investors had been led to believe. As detailed infra, Netflix reported roughly 204 million global subscribers as of the end of Q4’20, implying a global market penetration of roughly 24%, but Netflix failed to disclose that there were more than 90 million additional households that used Netflix’s services through account sharing. The effective degree of market penetration, therefore, was around 35%. Reaching higher levels of penetration outside UCAN, and thus globally, would require the Company to expand its library of local content for those markets, which was a longer-term prospect. Thus, while there was still “headroom” to grow, Netflix was a lot closer to the ceiling of its potential growth than anyone in the market had reason to believe. In March 2021, media reports indicated that some Netflix users were seeing the following warning: “If you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.” In the following days, analysts issued reports estimating that between 26% and 33% of Netflix subscribers shared their account. Even the worst-case estimates, however, substantially underestimated the degree of account sharing that Netflix was experiencing. When asked why Netflix was testing methods to limit account sharing and why this was “right time to start tightening the screws” on this long-standing issue, Defendants claimed that the testing was not “new” but part of Netflix’s continuing approach to offer plans that meet the broad sets of needs of its members. Specifically, during the April 20, 2021 Q1’21 earnings call, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer Gregory Peters stated that Netflix is “really seeking that sort of flexible approach to make sure that we are providing the plans with the right features and the right price points,” and while the Company wanted to ensure that only paying members use the service, the testing was “not necessarily a new thing” and “[w]e’ve been doing this for a while.” Over the next several quarters, Defendants claimed that “the underlying business metrics are really healthy,” and any weakness was attributable to “choppiness” caused by the COVID pull-forward. Even when acknowledging that the UCAN and the Latin American regions “grew paid memberships more slowly” because “[t]hese regions have higher penetration,” Defendants assured there was still “ample runway for growth.” The truth began to emerge on January 20, 2022, after the market closed, when Netflix released its financial results for Q4’21. On that date, Netflix announced that it had missed its guidance for paid net adds in Q4’21 by 200,000 subscribers and that it only expected 2.5 million paid net adds in Q1’22 (compared to 4 million during the comparable period a year ago). Defendants attributed the shortfall to “the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship,” revealing that “acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels.” On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $110.75, or 21.7%, to close at $397.50 per share on January 21, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume. This drop wiped out approximately $49 billion of market capitalization in one day. Analysts were alarmed that the weak Q1’22 guidance reflected undisclosed underlying problems, but Defendants continued to issue materially false and/or misleading statements. During the January 20, 2022 Q4’21 earnings call, an analyst specifically asked whether management had “any concerns . . . about anything structural, whether it’s competition or saturation.” Neumann posited that “[i]t’s tough to say exactly why our acquisition hasn’t kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels” but attested that there was “[n]o structural change in the business.” Co-Chief Executive Officer (“Co-CEO”) Reed Hastings also dismissed concerns, stating that “COVID has introduced so much noise.” Co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly cited “bumpiness” caused by the COVID pull-forward as affecting predictions and stated that “all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.” The truth was revealed on April 19, 2022, after the market closed, when the Company admitted to the true extent of account sharing and acknowledged that account sharing caused Netflix to be highly penetrated in the applicable markets, thereby inhibiting subscriber growth. Specifically, Netflix stated that “in addition to our 222m paying households, we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region.” Moreover, “our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts – combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.” Excluding the impact of a service suspension in Russia, Q1’22 paid net adds totaled 0.5 million, significantly missing guidance of 2.5 million. The market was shocked. Analysts expressed astonishment at the extent of the account sharing and the degree of market saturation that the Company had now admitted to, and what those facts meant about the Company’s future prospects. For example, J.P. Morgan issued a report stating that the Q1’21 results represented “a sea change quarter for NFLX in which the company essentially conceded to every key point of the bear thesis[.]” Beyond the disappointing quarterly results themselves, J.P. Morgan observed that “the bigger factor is management’s acknowledgement of relatively high household penetration when including account sharing[.]” Similarly, Bank of America stated, “Management now concedes that between paying subscribers and password sharers, most of the key markets, UCAN and EMEA likely, have saturated and it will be very hard to find new many subscribers in these markets in the near to medium term.” Analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson LLC said, “Everything they’ve tried to convince me of over the last five years was given up in one quarter. It’s such [an] about face.” Following Netflix’s April 19, 2022 disclosures, the Company’s share price fell $122.42, or over 35%, to close at $226.19 per share on April 20, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume, wiping out approximately $54 billion in market capitalization. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors, inter alia: (1) that during the Class Period, between 91 million and 100+ million households were using Netflix globally through account sharing without paying Netflix for its services; (2) that during the Class Period, between 29 million and 30+ million households were using Netflix in the UCAN region without paying Netflix for its services; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Netflix was substantially more penetrated in the applicable markets than investors were led to believe by Netflix’s reported subscriber data and public statements concerning market penetration; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Netflix’s ability to acquire new paying members was severely hindered. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.",

      "summary": "Talis Biomedical is a medical diagnostics company that was founded in 2010. The company’s initial focus was on developing tests for sexually transmitted infections. In July 2020, Talis received a $25 million contract from the National Institutes of Health to develop a COVID-19 test. By late 2020, Talis was running out of cash and decided to try to raise money by conducting an initial public offering. Although Talis had not yet submitted a request for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the FDA, the company stated in its January 22, 2021 Registration Statement that it had already submitted applications to the FDA for EUA for its COVID-19 test. The Registration Statement further stated that Talis’s COVID-19 test had “demonstrated 97% PPA and 93.9% NPA,” which “is suggestive of clinical sensitivity and specificity in the broader clinical population and is driven by the very low limits of detection possible on the Talis One platform.” The Registration Statement included a risk disclosure, stating that “[t]here can be no assurance that the COVID-19 test we are developing for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be granted an EUA by the FDA.” Talis submitted an application to the FDA for EUA on January 29, 2021. The FDA “requested that [Talis] provide it with additional information on [its] test prior to initiating its substantive review of the submission,” and Talis stated in its February 8, 2021 amended Registration Statement that it “expect[ed] to promptly provide” the additional information. On February 11, 2021, Talis conducted its IPO. After the IPO, Talis submitted the additional information requested by the FDA. In late February 2021, the FDA informed Talis that the comparator assay it used “may not have had sufficient sensitivity to support Talis’s EUA application.” On March 8, 2021, Talis announced that it had withdrawn its EUA application. Talis’s stock price dropped from $15.60 per share on March 5, 2021 to $12.85 per share on March 8, 2021. Talis submitted a new EUA application in July 2021. Talis received EUA in November 2021. In March 2022, Talis announced that it had not started its phased launch of the Talis One COVID-19 Test System due to challenges with manufacturing. Talis’s stock price dropped from $1.69 per share on March 15, 2022 to $1.30 per share on March 16, 2022. Talis’s stock price continued to drop and was $0.41 per share when plaintiffs filed the consolidated complaint in May 2023. Plaintiffs filed this putative securities class action on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Talis’s common stock between February 11, 2021 and March 15, 2022. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding the Talis One COVID-19 test and that when the truth was revealed, the price of Talis’s stock dropped, causing damages to plaintiffs and the class. Plaintiffs assert the following claims: (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 against Talis and the officer defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the officer defendants.",

      "summary": "Lucid is an electric vehicle (“EV”) company founded in 2007. The company operates a manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, and a warehouse in Tempe, Arizona. Lucid began as a battery company but later shifted to designing and manufacturing its own vehicles. In 2016, Lucid unveiled the “Lucid Air,” a luxury EV sedan. The public and industry commentators responded to the Lucid Air with enthusiasm. Rawlinson, Lucid’s chief executive officer (“CEO”) and chief technology officer (“CTO”), stated that the Lucid Air was designed to compete with other high-end luxury automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Over the next several years, Lucid faced various production delays. The company initially planned to begin producing the Lucid Air in 2018. In 2017, Lucid took loans from a hedge fund and a Chinese bus company to fund its operations. In 2018, Lucid entered into a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), to raise an additional $1 billion. In 2020, Lucid stated that it had completed the first phase of its manufacturing facility in Arizona, and announced that it would begin producing the Lucid Air in the second quarter of 2021. However, by early 2021, Lucid had still not begun producing the Lucid Air. In February 2021, Lucid announced plans to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV (“Churchill”) in order to become a publicly traded company. Lucid stated that it would require $600 million in bridge funding to continue its operations until the merger closed. Lucid also announced that commercial production of the Lucid Air would be delayed until the second half of 2021, after the merger’s expected close. The merger was completed in July 2021. Rawlinson received a $2 million bonus and a stock option package as a result of the merger. Lucid announced that it had begun production of the Lucid Air in September 2021, and made its first deliveries to customers in October 2021. On November 15, 2021, Lucid announced that it had 17,000 reservations for the Lucid Air. Rawlinson stated that Lucid was “confident in [its] ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022.” House, Lucid’s chief financial officer (“CFO”), stated that Lucid was “committed to [its] plan to achieve 20,000 units in the calendar year.” Rawlinson and House also stated that the company faced risks, including “the extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges that the automotive industry has been facing.” Rawlinson also stated that Lucid had “continued to deliver against our time line and with the highest standard of quality.” On November 16, 2021, Rawlinson stated that Lucid had “a factory scale for 34,000 units a year.” Rawlinson also stated that Lucid had “mitigation plans” for “supply chain shortages that the entire industry is facing.” On February 14, 2022, Daniel Witt, Lucid’s Head of State & Local Public Policy, stated that Lucid was “looking to produce about 20,000 units” in 2022. Witt also stated that Lucid had “the capacity to fill all the orders received to date and more.” On February 28, 2022, Lucid announced that it was updating its 2022 production outlook to a range of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. Rawlinson stated that the production outlook reflected “the extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges we’ve encountered.” Rawlinson also stated that Lucid had been “primarily constrained” by “a small handful of our 250 suppliers.” Rawlinson stated that Lucid prioritized “quality over numbers.” House stated that Lucid “expect[ed] to remain supply chain constrained in select parts of the business in the coming months, and project improvement in the second half of the year.” On May 5, 2022, Lucid announced that it was reiterating its 2022 production outlook of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. Rawlinson stated that Lucid “continued to make progress in the first quarter of 2022 despite on-going global supply chain challenges.” House stated that Lucid “continue[d] to face global supply chain and logistics challenges, including Covid-related factory shutdowns in China.” House also stated that Lucid’s production outlook was contingent on supply chain and logistics disruptions not being “material” and its “mitigation plans” being effective. On May 20, 2022, Rawlinson stated that Lucid was “working assiduously to overcome our near-term challenges with commodity goods are being resolved” and that Lucid was “looking forward to hitting our 12 to 14,000 Units that we’re targeting for production this year.” On May 26, 2022, a Lucid spokesperson stated that Lucid was “committed to maintaining a consistent, high level of quality as we ramp production towards our year-end goal of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles.” On August 3, 2022, Lucid announced that it was updating its 2022 production outlook to a range of 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles. Rawlinson stated that the updated production outlook reflected “the logistic challenges I described as we begin scaling, which exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes.” Rawlinson stated that Lucid had “unplanned production pauses” in the second quarter of 2022 due to “logistics processes.” On September 28, 2023, AP7 filed its consolidated complaint. AP7 claims that Defendants made false or misleading statements during the class period, which AP7 defines as running from November 15, 2021 to August 3, 2022. AP7 alleges that Defendants knew that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production outlook of 20,000 vehicles, and that Lucid’s production delays were due to internal issues rather than external supply chain issues. AP7 brings two claims: (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Rawlinson and House. On November 22, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss AP7’s consolidated complaint. On February 22, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court found that AP7 failed to adequately plead the falsity of Defendants’ statements regarding the 2022 production outlook and the reasons for Lucid’s production delays. The Court also found that AP7 failed to adequately plead scienter. The Court granted AP7 leave to amend its complaint. On March 21, 2024, AP7 filed its first amended complaint. AP7 alleges that Defendants knew that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production outlook of 20,000 vehicles, and that Lucid’s production delays were due to internal issues rather than external supply chain issues. AP7 brings two claims: (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Rawlinson and House. On April 25, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss AP7’s first amended complaint.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Cutera, headquartered in Brisbane, California, is a global provider of laser and other energy-based aesthetic and dermatology solutions for medical practitioners worldwide. Cutera was formed in 1998 as a Delaware corporation. Cutera’s operations are segregated into two reportable business segments: (i) Core Capital (which included core capital equipment and consumables) and (ii) AviClear. Core Capital includes sales of non-AviClear equipment and related one-time use products necessary to perform treatments with the equipment. One-time products, referred to as consumables, include the sale cycles—the fees for system usage on a treatment-by-treatment basis—and consumable products, the physical materials used for each cycle, such as needle cartridges and sticky pads. Core Capital drives a substantial portion of Cutera’s total revenue. In 2022, when Cutera first introduced AviClear, Core Capital accounted for 98% of total revenue. Almost two years after the AviClear rollout, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Core Capital still accounted for over 91% of total revenue. Core Capital also generates revenue from consumables. CW 3 indicated that the company makes more money on the sales of consumables than the devices themselves because the consumables were a constant revenue stream. Consumables were thus an important component of Cutera’s business. Not only did consumables provide Cutera with a recurring revenue stream, but consumables were necessary for customers to be able to use the devices and capital equipment that they bought or leased. That is, if Cutera did not have enough consumables to accompany the devices that Cutera sold to customers (as was the case here), then customers would not be able to use the devices and capital equipment. Worse, Cutera would not receive any recurring revenue from consumables, and, on top of that, be faced with angry customers who were left with useless equipment. Having control over its inventory was therefore critical to Cutera’s financial performance. During the Class Period, Cutera embarked on an all-hands-on-deck initiative to place its new acne treating device called AviClear into as many customers’ offices as possible, no matter the cost. AviClear, as Cutera described, is a laser treatment that offers a prescription-free solution for acne. Cutera began a limited commercial launch of AviClear in April 2022. On April 5, 2022, Cutera issued a press release announcing that the first patient outside of clinical trials was treated with AviClear. And in November 2022, Cutera had its full commercial release of AviClear. Cutera developed a new AviClear leasing model (which differed from Cutera’s other businesses), in part, to compete with a similar product called Accure, which was coming to market around the same time as AviClear. CW 2 confirmed that Cutera shifted to this lease or subscription model for AviClear in reaction to Accure, which the company knew would soon be entering the market. CW 2 indicated that Cutera wanted to get AviClear into the market as quickly as possible, and into as many customers’ offices, to preempt that competition. This rush to beat competition, however, caused AviClear device failures due to Cutera likely not testing the equipment as much as it should have, as described further below. Evidencing the importance Cutera placed on selling AviClear, Cutera not only assembled an AviClear-exclusive sales team (i.e., TSRs), but Cutera also permitted capital equipment representatives to sell AviClear devices. In fact, they were not just permitted to do so, they were directed to do so by Defendants. Federal law requires that the CEO and CFO of public companies, such as Cutera, certify their company’s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and the procedures established by those companies to prepare the financial statements and disclosures. Section 302 of SOX—designed to ensure that a public company’s CEO and CFO take a proactive role in their company’s public disclosures and to instill investors with confidence concerning the accuracy, quality, and reliability of a company’s periodic SEC reports—requires that a CEO and CFO of a public company address the following topics in annual SEC filings (i.e., a Form 10-K for Cutera): (i) the material accuracy and fair presentation of the report’s disclosures; (ii) establishment and maintenance of “disclosure controls and procedures” (“DCP”); and (iii) any material changes to the company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Specifically, the CEO and CFO must certify that: (i) they have reviewed the periodic report; (ii) it does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make any statements made not misleading; (iii) based on their knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information fairly present the financial condition and operations of the company; (iv) they have maintained disclosure controls and internal controls and have designed such controls to ensure that all material information is made known to them and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information; and (v) they have disclosed to the audit committee and auditors all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls. These certifications communicate to investors that all material information required to be disclosed is contained in the report. Section 404 of SOX requires management of public companies such as Cutera to establish and maintain a system of internal controls relating to, among other things, financial reporting. Section 404 further requires management to document, test, and maintain those controls and procedures to ensure their effectiveness, as well as to assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis. Ultimately, Section 404 requires that management of a public company annually evaluates the effectiveness of the company’s ICFR and discloses the conclusion, including any material weaknesses, to investors. Section 404 of SOX was “intended to bring information about material weaknesses in [internal controls] into public view.” SEC Release 33-8810. Under Item 308 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR § 229.308(a)(3), “[m]anagement is not permitted to conclude that the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting is effective if there are one or more material weaknesses in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.” A material weakness, as defined within Cutera’s Forms 10-K, is “a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in [internal control over financial reporting] such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.” Section 404 of SOX requires management of public companies to select an internal control framework and then assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of those internal controls on an annual basis. According to the Company’s filings, Cutera adopted the “Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control Framework.” The COSO Framework states: “[i]nternal control is a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives” relating to (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (ii) reliability of financial reporting; and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. COSO identifies five interrelated components of internal control: (i) control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring activities. COSO requires that: “[e]ach of the five components of internal control and relevant principles is present and functioning [and that] [t]he five components are operating together in an integrated manner.” COSO also identifies that these components are relevant to an entire entity and to the entity level, its subsidiaries, divisions, or any of its individual operating units or functions. A “restatement” is “the process of revising previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error in those financial statements.” (ASC 250-10-20, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.) When an error is identified that is material to previously issued financial statements, an entity is required to restate and reissue those financial statements. (ASC 250-10-45-27 and ASC 250-10-S99.) Under the above federal laws, Defendants were required to implement internal controls over Cutera’s financial reporting, to certify the accuracy of such reporting and that no material weaknesses exist, and to issue a restatement for quarters where material errors in the financial reporting exist. As explained herein, Defendants failed to implement adequate internal controls for several quarters, as evidenced by Cutera restating its financials for the first and second quarters of 2023. Notwithstanding the above-referenced requirements, throughout the Class Period, Defendants concealed from investors a number of severe problems that contributed to Cutera’s dramatic nosedive, including: (i) a lack of control over inventory and internal controls weaknesses; (ii) widespread supply chain problems leading to order fulfillment problems and parts availability backlogs; (iii) rampant quality control and reliability problems, equipment breakdowns, and unmet demands for equipment repairs and service; and (iv) managements’ failure to effectively execute the AviClear rollout, including over-indexing resources to place AviClear devices at the expense of Cutera’s core business. Since the beginning of the Class Period, Cutera had no control over its ITGC or inventory controls, which worsened when Cutera tried to implement a formal ERP system during the Class Period. Generally speaking, an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system helps a company manage each of its business operations from a single platform, which includes managing all aspects of the company’s inventory in real time, including costs, orders, products and materials in stock, and supplier information. All companies that deal with sales and inventory would therefore be expected to employ a robust ERP system. Moreover, Cutera’s version of Salesforce, a system designed to track Cutera’s labor, travel time, and parts used on service calls was also obsolete and ineffective. Indeed, CW 6 indicated that while the company had an inventory system prior to the implementation of SAP and Salesforce in 2022, it was not a “formal” system, which she described as a “very generic inventory” system. Cutera announced on February 22, 2022 that it would ramp-up investment in a long-awaited ERP system throughout the year to enable “long-term scalability” of the Company’s operations, and finally took its new system live in the first quarter of 2022. This upgrade to a new ERP system exacerbated the problems plaguing Cutera’s information technology infrastructure related to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and inventory count controls. Indeed, at least since the beginning of the Class Period, Cutera had extensive problems managing and controlling its inventory and maintaining adequate internal controls of its financial reporting and overseeing its operations. As investors later learned, the Company-wide weaknesses in ITGC went hand-in-hand with internal weaknesses in Cutera’s inventory controls, which were exacerbated by the botched rollout of the ERP/SAP system. As Defendants admitted in April 2023, the material weaknesses over inventory controls “related to the completeness, existence, and cut-off of inventories held at third parties, inventories held by sales personnel, and inventories in transit, and controls related to the calculation of adjustments to inventory for items considered excessive and obsolete.” Multiple CWs recalled that since the start of the Class Period, Cutera had problems controlling and overseeing its inventory, supply chain, and internal controls. For example, CW 8 recalled that Cutera never had a formal ERP system prior to the system implemented in January 2022. CW 8 indicated that the Field Service team used Salesforce to track its labor, travel time, and parts used on service calls. CW 8 added that the older version was not meeting certain compliance requirements, so the company upgraded. She commented, however, that Cutera invested just enough money in the systems to make them work, but not enough to make them work effectively. Likewise, CW 6 recalled that Cutera had problems implementing the new Salesforce and SAP systems. She added that the company “went cheap,” and the implementation went “catastrophically downhill” as a result. CW 8 explained that the change to the new SAP system began in January 2022, and the change over to the new Salesforce system began in approximately February 2022. CW 8 indicated that the process to identify which parts were used or needed was not clearly defined in the system. As a result, she explained, parts would be used by the engineers but would still appear in the system as available. In other words, she added, the system would show that a particular part was available in the warehouse, when it was not. To make matters worse, Cutera employees were not formally trained on the new ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems until months after their implementation—meaning that even if the systems had worked properly (which they did not), the systems would still be ineffective since the workers were not trained on them. For example, CW 8 explained that there were two to three months of using these new systems without any formal training. CW 8 emphasized that even two to three months after implementation, during the training, the system was still not working correctly; it continued to not work correctly for a long time after. CW 8 commented that “it was a mess.” Nor was there any oversight of these new systems when they were first implemented, which contravenes Defendants’ obligations to monitor its inventory controls. Indeed, CW 8 commented that it was “almost like there was no oversight” for the first few months with the new systems. CW 8 also recalled that there was no process in place for management to review open work orders or to monitor whether work was completed. She noted that some work orders which were completed remained open in the system, because there was no process for entering that completed work order in the system, to show that it had been done, and to enter the parts and labor used in the work order properly. With no training on and no oversight of the ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems—systems whose primary responsibility was to manage the Company’s inventory—problems with tracking inventory naturally occurred. One such problem was that the amount of inventory that the systems displayed never matched the actual physical inventory at Cutera’s facility. Consequently, such a mismatch would necessarily lead to the inaccurate accounting of such inventory (and related financial metrics) on Cutera’s financial statements—as Defendants later admitted was the case for several quarters during the Class Period. For instance, regarding the problem of the SAP system showing parts on hand in the warehouse when those parts in reality were unavailable, CW 8 explained that those problems started in approximately the second or third quarters of 2022. She also noted that there were “loads” of back-order parts in the system, and that logging the consumption of parts by the FSEs in the system was cumbersome, which contributed to the inventory counts being off. Critically, CW 8 recalled the problem of discrepancies between parts listed in the system with parts available in the warehouse was raised in meetings. She noted that the FSEs carried inventory, referred to as “trunk stock,” with them for their work orders. Indeed, she added that the FSEs were required periodically to conduct an inventory count of their trunk stock and report the results to accounting, and that these counts were done at least annually, sometimes more frequently, and that there were occasional one-off or spot checks of trunk stock inventory. CW 8 understood that Defendant Seth and Thier saw that information. In addition to the botched rollout of the ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems, Defendants also failed to establish any meaningful controls over the physical inventory stored in the Company’s warehouse. For example, CW 6 explained that she had visited the warehouse facility in the company’s headquarters, which is where the inventory was stored and where the company’s main offices were also located. She recalled that while employees needed a key to enter the building itself, all Cutera employees had access to the building. Once inside, she added, there were no access controls for the warehouse section itself. Specifically, CW 6 explained that there were no designated rooms within the building to keep inventory securely; instead, inventory was everywhere, including in the hallways. She described how anyone could walk in, put parts in their pocket, and simply walk out without getting caught. Furthermore, CW 6 explained that Cutera’s management—specifically Pinapati—knew that anyone could walk into the warehouse area and take parts, as management’s offices were in the same building. CW 6 added that management’s offices, including Mowry’s, were on the first floor of the building, the same floor as the inventory, but then management’s offices eventually moved to the second floor of the building. CW 6 indicated that Pinapati had been told several times about the inventory problems. CW 6 recalled that the FSEs raised their concerns about availability of parts to their managers and field directors, who in turn raised the concerns to Pinapati, who ran the Field Service group. She also recalled a conference call meeting with Pinapati and all the FSEs in June or July 2022 to discuss these problems. During that call, CW 6 recalled, Pinapati told the FSEs that everything would be fixed, and inventory processes brought under control within 30 days, and that it was his top priority. She added that, despite Pinapati’s assurances, nothing changed. Furthermore, it was CW 6’s understanding that Pinapati was part of regular meetings with Mowry and other Vice Presidents all the time, as she noted there were frequent meetings of company management at its Brisbane headquarters. Cutera’s senior executives, especially Mowry, therefore knew about the lack of control over inventory which ultimately caused the Company’s internal controls to fail, or at the very least were reckless in not knowing about such problems considering, among other things, that they were explicitly told about inventory problems and worked in the very same building in which any Cutera employee could walk in and remove inventory. Yet Defendants did nothing to maintain adequate internal controls. The problems with Cutera’s ERP/SAP system and Defendants’ lack of control over inventory created supply chain constraints and severely impacted Cutera’s ability to fulfill customer orders, and thus harmed Cutera’s business. In fact, as explained further below, these inventory problems ultimately resulted in an extended plant shutdown. For example, CW 5 noted that, at one point in late 2022 or early 2023, the company stopped shipping everything to customers, including consumables. Similarly, CW 1 recalled that Cutera had been struggling with supply chain and inventory problems throughout 2023. She explained that the source of the problem was Pinapati, whom CW 1 described as “asleep at the wheel.” She added that there was also excess inventory on devices that Cutera barely sold, but minimal or lack of inventory for the company’s top three sellers, including AviClear. CW 1 added that Mowry knew about these problems, but he appeared to protect Pinapati and refused to take action. She also recalled that Mowry knew about the inventory problems because Batarseh, Eckerman, and Sennet informed her that they told Mowry that Pinapati’s inventory estimates were wrong. CW 1 further elaborated that many people raised concerns about supply chain problems, and Pinapati’s performance, to Mowry. She elaborated that concerns were raised to Mowry by Huffman, Batarseh, Eckerman, Thier, Karavitis, and Sennett. Indeed, CW 1 indicated that she raised the same concerns to Mowry herself, and that these problems were discussed all throughout 2023. She added that when Defendant Hopkins became Interim-CEO, she also refused to take"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Rain is a clinical-stage precision oncology company based in Newark, California. In September 2020, Rain acquired a license to develop and potentially sell milademetan from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”). Milademetan was a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (“MDM2”). MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors (which is a category of drugs that included milademetan) have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Although MDM2 inhibitors have been studied for almost two decades, none has progressed past early-phase clinical trials in solid-tumor patients due to the fact that they cause myelosuppression (i.e., a decrease in bone marrow activity that results in reduced production of blood cells). Daiichi Sankyo conducted milademetan’s Phase 1 clinical trial. The trial was officially titled “A Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Study of Milademetan in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas” but Daiichi Sankyo referred to it as “U101”. U101 took place between July 2013 and October 2020. It was a single-arm, open-label study designed to test milademetan in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas. When initiated in July 2013, the study represented the first clinical trial in which milademetan was administered to humans, i.e., a first-in-human study. One of U101’s primary objectives was to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose, according to Daiichi Sankyo’s study plan. Daiichi Sankyo conducted U101 at five test sites within the United States. Initially, U101 consisted of two parts: Part 1 was a dose-escalation part aimed at identifying the maximum tolerable dose; and Part 2 was a dose-expansion part to test the safety and tolerability of potential doses. Part 2 was ultimately abandoned after Daiichi Sankyo determined it could not meet the objectives under its dosing schedule because the dose identified as effective was not tolerable, i.e., the dose was too toxic for study participants. U101’s study protocol identified various endpoints to measure the efficacy of milademetan. These efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, time to response, response duration, and progression-free survival. During the trial, milademetan was initially given orally once daily on a 28-day cycle at a starting dose of 15 mg. Due to excessive toxicity, Daiichi Sankyo explored intermittent dosing schedules and ultimately identified a recommended dose for further evaluation (i.e., the recommended Phase 2 dose) of 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days. This dose was not part of the initial study protocol but instead identified while U101 was underway. Only 16 study participants with dedifferentiated liposarcoma received this dose in the U101 trial. This subgroup of study participants represented 15% of U101’s overall population. The subgroup demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months (compared to 2.1 months under current standard of care treatment). Rain went public in April 2021. Within its initial public offering documents, Rain prominently featured the Company’s licensing deal with Daiichi Sankyo for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize milademetan. Rain’s prospectus also described Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial for milademetan. It explained that the “objective of the Phase 1 trial was to identify a maximum tolerated dose” and that over the course of the trial, it developed an “intermittent dosing schedule” that would be used in future trials. The intermittent dosing schedule (referred to as “Schedule D”) was a dose of 260 mg for three days every 14 days, as described above (i.e., 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days). Rain told investors that “patients treated on Schedule D at a dose of 260 mg (MTD) had a mPFS of 7.4 months, which was longer than the reported mPFS of 2.2 months for trabectedin and 2.0 months for eribulin in WD/DD LPS patients.” In other words, Rain represented “[d]ata from WD/DD LPS patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated median progression-free survival (mPFS) approximately three to four times greater than the current standards of care (SOC), trabectedin or eribulin.” When describing the Phase 1 trial data, Rain’s prospectus did not disclose Daiichi Sankyo’s intent to conduct a two-part trial, where the first part would be to identify a dose and the second part would then test that dose across an expanded population, or that the results of the Phase 1 trial would be used to develop and conduct a Phase 2 trial. Instead, Rain stated repeatedly that the Phase 1 trial results supported “rapidly” advancing directly to a “pivotal Phase 3 trial in WD/DD LPS patients.” Analysts from top-tier investment banks issued “buy” and “overweight” ratings based on Rain’s representations. These analysts echoed Rain’s statements about the Phase 1 trial data and how it significantly “de-risked” milademetan and supported the Company’s plans to advance directly to a Phase 3 trial. Rain used its initial public offering to raise $121.9 million in net proceeds from retail investors. According to its prospectus, Rain intended to use approximately $60 million of the cash to fund clinical trials, including its “pivotal Phase 3 trial” for milademetan. Rain told investors in its prospectus that the cash raised from the initial public offering was sufficient to fund operations through 2024. On July 20, 2021, Rain commenced its Phase 3 trial for milademetan. Rain referred to the trial as the “MANTRA” trial and described it as follows: The MANTRA trial, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RAIN-32 compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care, in patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without a well-differentiated (WD) LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy. Approximately 160 patients are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan or trabectedin. The primary objective of the trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient reported outcomes. Analysts reported that Rain commenced the Phase 3 trial in line with its prior guidance, i.e., the second half of 2021 or 2H21. Analysts also reiterated that the Phase 3 trial was clinically de-risked, given Rain’s statements about the Phase 1 trial data. Analysts reconfirmed their “overweight” and “buy” ratings for Rain. On September 20, 2021, while Rain’s Phase 3 trial was ongoing, Daiichi Sankyo published results from a separate clinical trial testing milademetan in patients with intimal sarcoma (i.e., tumors that arise in the pulmonary artery). The trial results reported unusually high rates of hematologic toxicities, including Grade 3 events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreases, and anemia. The results also included a 20% objective response rate. The study participants received 260 mg doses of milademetan. On May 22, 2023, Rain announced topline results for its Phase 3 trial, i.e., the MANTRA trial. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression free survival. In pertinent part, Rain described the results as follows: The median PFS for milademetan was 3.6 months vs 2.2 months for trabectedin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89, p=0.53. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the milademetan arm included nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and neutropenia. The most common Grade 3/4 TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (39.5%), neutropenia (25.5%) and anemia (18.6%). Dose reductions in the milademetan arm were 44.2% vs 29.1% in the trabectedin arm. Discontinuation in the milademetan arm due to AEs were 11.6% vs 19.0% for trabectedin. Based upon these topline data, Rain does not expect to pursue further development of milademetan in DD LPS. . . . Phase 3 MANTRA Topline Data Results:  The median PFS was 3.6 months with milademetan versus 2.2 months for trabectedin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI [0.61 to 1.29]; p=0.53) based on 115 events  Most common TEAEs in the milademetan arm included nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and neutropenia  The most common Grade 3/4 TEAEs in the milademetan arm were thrombocytopenia (39.5%), neutropenia (25.5%) and anemia (18.6%)  Dose reductions in the milademetan arm were 44.2% vs 29.1% in the trabectedin arm  Discontinuations in the milademetan arm due to AEs were 11.6% vs 19.0% for trabectedin  Treatment emergent SAEs in the milademetan arm were 36.0% vs 48.1% in the trabectedin arm Analysts from several top-tier investment banks downgraded Rain in response to the news. In their reports, the analysts noted the risks of proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial from Phase 1. They also noted that the Phase 3 trial results included more Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events (i.e., thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia) than anticipated. According to the analysts, the elevated level of adverse events suggested that the dosing schedule had not been properly optimized during the Phase 1 trial. Analysts also noted that Rain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Robert C. Doebele, acknowledged during a conference call earlier in the day that the 260 mg dose was too high. Rain abandoned its clinical trial plan for milademetan after the Phase 3 trial failed. On May 22, 2023, contemporaneously with the announcements of the Phase 3 trial results, Rain confirmed that it was no longer pursuing any line of therapy involving milademetan for the treatment of DD LPS. Given that DD LPS was the highest probability indication for an MDM2 inhibitor (such as milademetan), analysts immediately lowered their models for Rain while investors likewise decided to exit their positions in the stock. In the span of just one day, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023 to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023. On May 28, 2023, Rain suspended ongoing clinical development of milademetan. The Company also decided to wind down research and development activities, implement a substantial reduction in force, and initiate a review of strategic alternatives. Rain’s Board of Directors also instructed management to identify potential financial advisors to assist the Company in connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives. On May 30, 2023, Rain announced plans to suspend further development of milademetan, including suspension of enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2 MANTRA-2 basket trial and the termination of plans for its Phase 1/2 MANTRA-4 combination trial, as well as a reduction in headcount of approximately 65%, and a plan to evaluate alternatives to enhance its pipeline through precision oncology program acquisitions or other transactions. On August 10, 2023, Rain reported its financial earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In pertinent part, the Company announced it had decided to discontinue the entire development program for milademetan, including its other ongoing MANTRA studies. Rain also announced it had decided to focus on “cost-saving measures, including a reduction in force,” and was actively looking for new opportunities to license or acquire clinical-stage programs and technologies. On October 17, 2023, Rain entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Pathos AI, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing artificial intelligence-powered pathology tools. The purpose of the agreement was to allow both companies to share information with one another to negotiate a merger or acquisition. On November 16, 2023, Rain and Pathos AI executed a proposal whereby Pathos AI would acquire Rain through a tender offer. On December 13, 2023, Rain announced the acquisition by Pathos AI. According to the announcement, Pathos AI will acquire Rain for $1.16 per share plus contingent value rights equaling approximately $0.17 per share based on the deal closing and milademetan’s first patient dosing within five years. Rain shareholders presently have until January 25, 2024 to tender their shares under the terms of the acquisition agreement. Rain contravened customary practices, industry standards, and widely-accepted academic literature by abandoning Daiichi Sankyo’s clinical trial plans and advancing milademetan directly from Phase 1 to Phase 3, i.e., Phase 2 Bypass. Milademetan did not qualify for Phase 2 Bypass. Its mechanism of action and safety profile were not well characterized. Milademetan was a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (previously defined as “MDM2”). MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors (which is a category of drugs that includes milademetan) have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Although MDM2 inhibitors have been studied for almost two decades, none has progressed past early-phase clinical trials in solid-tumor patients due to the fact that they cause myelosuppression (i.e., a decrease in bone marrow activity that results in reduced production of blood cells). Milademetan, as an MDM2 inhibitor, had not received marketing authorization from any regulatory agency and, as such, the drug had no clinical practice history. In fact, Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial was a “first-in-human” study, meaning that it was the first time ever that milademetan was administered to humans. According to Daiichi Sankyo’s study protocol, the goal of the Phase 1 trial was to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose, thereby confirming that a Phase 2 dose had been and was intended to follow the Phase 1 trial. The need for a Phase 2 trial was especially prevalent given that Daiichi Sankyo was unable to complete Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial, as initially anticipated. Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial was supposed to serve as a dose expansion part in which the recommended dose would be administered to an expanded population of study participants. Instead, Daiichi Sankyo identified the recommended Phase 2 dose (i.e., 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days) during the Phase 1 as opposed to being part of the study protocol from the outset, which undermined the reliability of the results. In total, the Phase 1 trial data that Rain supposedly relied upon when advancing directly to Phase 3 consisted of only 16 patients, which amounted to only 15% of the overall Phase 1 trial participants. Former Employee 1 (“FE1”) was a Senior Director, Program Management, at Rain from December 2020 to December 2021. FE1 was responsible for the coordination of drug development, working with different teams from different departments within the Company. FE1’s duties included tracking the development progress of a drug and providing senior leadership, including Vellanki and Bryce, with updates. FE1 reported to Vellanki. FE1 confirmed that within the field of oncology drug development, Phase 2 trials are generally necessary to “dial down” on the specific dosing level of the drug candidate. Phase 2 trials are used to identify a dose or doses that are then tested in a Phase 3 trial, according to FE1. FE1 explained that milademetan, in particular, was very difficult and challenging in terms of identifying a dose because it was not suitable for daily use due to the biology of the molecule at issue and the toxicity it created. Milademetan necessitated atypical dosing. FE1 confirmed further that the Phase 1 trial conducted by Daiichi Sankyo did not “dial in” the dosing for milademetan. In fact, FE1 confirmed that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 study recommended a dosing schedule for a Phase 2 trial as opposed to a Phase 3 trial. Daiichi Sankyo’s trial results indicated a “recommended Phase 2 dose,” which means that the dose is then tested in a Phase 2 trial, according to FE1. FE1 explained that drug developers generally do not advance directly to Phase 3 trials at this point because the dataset, i.e., the patient population, for dosing schedules is usually too small. FE1 explained further that if drug developers or sponsors proceed straight to Phase 3 with a “recommended Phase 2 dose” from a Phase 1 trial, the dosing schedule might not work and the study may need to be redone. A Phase 2 trial allows the sponsor to test the recommended Phase 2 dose accordingly and then, if the data supports it, commence a Phase 3 trial to confirm the results. FE1 explained that in the case of Rain and milademetan, the Company should advancing directly from Phase 1 to Phase 3 was a big jump and pretty aggressive given the limited amount of patient data collected by Daiichi Sankyo in the Phase 1 trial, i.e., <20 patients. FE1 further explained that Vellanki and Bryce were aware of the Phase 1 trial data and the limitations it presented. FE1 said that Vellanki understood that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial recommended a Phase 2 dosing schedule and not a Phase 3 dosing schedule. FE1 also said that Bryce, who is a seasoned drug development executive, likewise understood the results and data from the Phase 1 trial and the fact that it recommended a Phase 2 dose instead of a Phase 3 dose. According to FE1, Vellanki and Bryce had substantial experience and consequently understood the data they had, its limitations, and the import of the decisions they were making. Rain’s competitors, who were developing similar drug candidates for similar treatments, followed the ordinary progression of the clinical trial process. Kartos Therapeutics, Aileron Therapeutics Inc., Ascentage Pharma Group, Boehringer Ingelheim, Astex Pharmaceuticals, or Novartis AG were either conducting dose escalation trials or pursuing other indications, such as myelofibrosis (Kartos’ KRT-232/AMG-232), hematologic malignancies (Roche Holding AG’s idasanutlin), or chemotherapy protectants (Aileron Therapeutics’ 6924). None was willing to contravene the customary practices, industry standards, or academic literature by engaging in a Phase 2 Bypass. Notwithstanding the"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Fastly securities between November 15, 2023 and August 7, 2024 (the “Class Period”). Defendant Fastly is a Delaware corporation that operates an edge cloud platform for processing, serving, and securing its customers’ applications. Fastly’s customers include organizations across many industries, but the majority of its top ten customers are in the media space (i.e., TikTok, Apple, Twitter (X), Paramount, and Amazon Video). Defendant Nightingale has served as Fastly’s CEO at all relevant times, and Defendant Kisling has served as Fastly’s CFO at all relevant times. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding macroeconomic impacts on the Company’s business, the Company’s existing customers expanding their use of Fastly’s services, and the Company’s continued emphasis on driving revenue growth through its existing customers. The following factual allegations are taken from Plaintiffs’ amended complaint and are assumed to be true for the purposes of this motion. Fastly’s Business Model Fastly operates an edge cloud platform for processing, serving, and securing its customers’ applications in the U.S., the Asia Pacific, Europe, and other international locations. The edge cloud is a category of IaaS that enables developers to build, secure, and deliver digital experiences. Organizations seeking to improve their user experience (i.e., by faster loading websites) can benefit from processing at the edge. Fastly’s customers include organizations across many different industries. According to CW1, the majority of the Company’s top ten customers are in the media space (i.e., TikTok, Apple, Twitter (X), Paramount, and Amazon Video), known at Fastly as the “media accounts.” The Company generates substantially all of its revenue from charging customers based on their usage of Fastly’s platform, measured in gigabytes. Typically, the Company enters into one-year contracts with customers, which include a minimum monthly billing commitment in exchange for more favorable pricing terms, although terms may vary by contract. Most of the Company’s contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. However, the Company also generates some revenue from additional products and professional and other services, such as implementation, account management, and customer support. The Company charges a flat one-time fee or recurring monthly fee for the additional products and services. According to CW2, negotiations for existing customer contracts typically begin three months before the contract is set to expire, particularly with larger enterprise customers. The bulk of the Company’s revenue is derived from existing customers’ usage of Fastly’s platform. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 95% and 94% of the Company’s revenue, respectively, was driven by usage of its platform. New customers contributed less than 10% of that revenue. Historically, the Company’s revenue has been driven primarily by its enterprise customers who leverage the platform substantially from a usage standpoint. The Company previously defined enterprise customers as those customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the trailing 12-month period. However, in 2023, the Company updated its methodology and redefined enterprise customers as those customers with annualized current quarter revenue in excess of $100,000, which is calculated by taking the revenue recognized in the current quarter and multiplying it by four. Under the prior methodology, the comparative revenue generated from enterprise customers versus non-enterprise customers for FY 2021, 2022, and 2023 was as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Enterprise customers $458,472,000 $386,853,000 $313,360,000 Non-enterprise customers $47,516,000 $45,872,000 $40,970,000 Total Revenue $505,988,000 $432,725,000 $354,330,000 Under the new methodology, the comparative revenue generated from enterprise customers versus non-enterprise customers for FY 2021, 2022, and 2023 was as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Enterprise customers $464,452,000 $393,152,000 $315,918,000 Non-enterprise customers $41,536,000 $39,573,000 $38,412,000 Total Revenue $505,988,000 $432,725,000 $354,330,000 The Company’s ten largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenue. In FY 2022, the ten largest customers generated an aggregate of 35% of the Company’s revenue and in FY 2023, they generated an aggregate of 37% of the Company’s revenue. Thus, changes in usage by these customers can create volatility in the Company’s revenue. The Company measures revenue growth from existing customers – either through increased usage of Fastly’s platform or purchase of additional products or services – using three key metrics: Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (“DBNER”), Net Retention Rate (“NRR”) and Last-Twelve Months Net Retention Rate (“LTM NRR”). DBNER measures the Company’s expansion of business with existing customers and provides insight into how effectively the Company is retaining and expanding its customer base over a specific period. DBNER increases when customers increase their usage of Fastly’s platform or purchase additional products. It declines when customers reduce their usage of Fastly’s platform, obtain lower pricing on their existing usage, or curtail their purchases of additional products. DBNER measures expansion only among continuing customers and does not indicate any decrease in revenue attributable to former customers. DBNER is calculated by dividing revenue for a given period from customers who remained customers as of the last day of the given period (the current period) by revenue from the same customers for the same period measured one year prior (the base period). The revenue included in the current period excludes customers that churned (i.e., terminated services) after the end of the base period and new customers that entered into customer agreements after the end of the base period. NRR captures the ability of the Company to retain revenue from existing customers over a specific period by measuring the change in revenue generated by existing customers from one period to another. Fastly calculates NRR by dividing revenue derived from existing customers in the last month of the period by revenue from those same customers during the last month of the same period one year prior. NRR is a metric that tracks growth from existing customers without factoring in new customer acquisition. A low NRR could indicate customer churn or dissatisfaction. A NRR greater than 100% is a growth indicator. Beginning in Q1 2024, the Company discontinued disclosing quarterly NRR and DBNER. The Company had reported DBNER as a key metric since its first quarterly report, its Q2 2019 quarterly report filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q on August 9, 2019. The Company had reported quarterly NRR as a key metric since its Q2 2020 quarterly report filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q on August 7, 2020. The Company still discloses LTM NRR, which it described as “intended to be supplemental to our NRR” when it first began disclosing LTM NRR in the Company’s Q3 2020 Quarterly Report filed on November 6, 2020. Fastly Experiences a Significant Customer Pullback Beginning in 2023 During the Class Period, Nightingale denied that macro forces were having an impact on the Company’s business, claiming that factors that had negatively impacted its competitors did not apply to Fastly because Fastly was not exposed to the type of customer where the market weakness was being felt (the SMB customer market). However, in reality, the Company did face exposure from SMB customers who, according to CW2, specifically cited economic reasons and noted a correlation with rising interest rates as a reason for customers’ requests for better pricing. Starting in March and April 2023, CW2’s mid-market enterprise customers began requesting more aggressive discounts when renewing their contracts with Fastly and threatened to terminate services with Fastly. According to CW2, customers were requesting these deals due to economic concerns and there was a direct correlation between when customers began asking for discounts and when interest rates began significantly rising. On average, customers were asking for a ten percent cut to their rates. Rather than agreeing to a discounted rate, Fastly often compromised by not increasing rates in the renewal contracts for these usage-based customers. According to CW2, when considering whether to agree to discounted rates, a major component Fastly considers is how much traffic the customer is driving towards Fastly. CW2 had to get approval from a VP of Sales for discounts that went past a certain threshold. The Company had a system in place that once a contract would go above a certain percentage of a discount, it required executive approval. CW1 similarly described how macro forces, such as rising interest rates, were “definitely in the business cycle” and in fact, negatively affecting the Company’s revenues overall throughout 2023, including revenues from Fastly’s largest customers, who were increasingly more price-conscious. CW1 referred to Nightingale’s macro statements as “BS,” and stated Nightingale was “probably just trying to keep the share price afloat.” Moreover, according to CW1, macro forces were negatively impacting the Company’s business as a whole, as even the largest customers were becoming increasingly price conscious and demanding better pricing. Adding to the pressures on Fastly was the fact that Fastly’s competitors (i.e., Cloudflare, Akamai, and Imperva) in the CDN market had caught up to the Company in technological prowess. Thus, Fastly had far less leverage in negotiating prices with its customers. CW1 confirmed that these macro concerns were discussed at the Company’s all hands meetings throughout 2023. Defendants also touted that the Company’s revenue growth was being driven by existing enterprise customers even as Defendants knew that revenue from existing enterprise customers, including the Company’s largest enterprise customers, was on the decline. Beginning in 2023 and throughout 2024, existing enterprise customers were losing their appetite for Fastly’s services. During 2023, several of CW1’s enterprise customers cancelled their contracts. For example, Indeed cancelled its $500,000/year security contract with Fastly in April 2023 because Fastly did not have the capability to fulfill their requirements for a bot solution. USAA’s two-year $400,000 deal ended in November 2023 because the Company never implemented Fastly’s software and CW1 could not convince the Company to deploy it. In both instances, CW1 knew more than six months before the contracts were set to renew that it would be difficult to keep those customers. CW1 also shared concerns about losing the $500,000/year contract if Fastly could not meet the customer’s requirements all the way up to the founder of the Company, Artur Bergman. CW4 worked on contract renewals for roughly ten existing customers between July 2023 through April 2024, and during that time period, only two of those customers were expanding their business with Fastly, while the majority of CW4’s customers were stagnant in how they used Fastly year over year. CW3, whose team handled clients responsible for at least $100 million of revenues, began to notice that revenues were declining for CW3’s largest customers in November 2023 because CW3 began struggling to meet the quotas that the Company set for CW3. By the end of 2023, CW3 was about 40% short of meeting the quota set for CW3. CW3’s colleagues were facing similar struggles with both large and small accounts. CW3 explained customers were no longer expanding their contracts with Fastly due to “tightening budgets” on their end, a general downturn in the tech sector as a whole, and sometimes being offered a better deal from competitors. According to CW1, the Company’s C-Suite “absolutely” knew by November 2023 that revenue for its larger customers was expected to decline because this issue was specifically being discussed in all hands meetings being held during Q4 2023 at these meetings. Nightingale discussed how large accounts were not bringing in as much traffic to Fastly, and the revenue derived from the large accounts was decreasing. He explained measures the Company was taking to address the decrease in traffic, such as assigning more “customer success” employees to the big accounts and using analytics to identify which accounts were slowing down the most. CW6 corroborated CW1’s account, describing that during all hands meetings during the last two quarters of 2023, including the November 2023 all hands meeting that occurred shortly after Fastly’s November 1, 2023 Q3 2023 earnings call, Nightingale discussed how several of the Company’s large media accounts were not bringing in as much traffic to Fastly. During that all hands meeting, Nightingale spoke about “decreasing revenue from [the Company’s] big customers” and how Fastly’s large media accounts had had “throttled down” their usage simultaneously, resulting in a decrease in revenue. Nightingale warned that a specific streaming company was “throttling things back, which is why revenue is down” (emphasis added). CW6 explained, during all hands meetings, Nightingale also discussed how the Company was trying to lessen its reliance on these big accounts by acquiring several other large enterprise accounts because he was concerned about Fastly’s revenue model relying on just a handful of big streaming accounts (i.e., Netflix and Disney), which CW6 described as “big whales” and which were known to fluctuate in how much they used Fastly’s services. According to CW6, the Company’s C-Suite and all employees attended the all hands meetings either in-person in the San Francisco office or remotely via Vimeo. The meetings included slide deck presentations and recordings of the meetings were distributed to all employees by email. The meetings were held regularly every quarter and typically occurred a week after the Company’s earnings call. The meetings would include slide deck presentations and there would be a recap of what was discussed during the earnings call. In addition, the Company also regularly tracked its customers’ usage of Fastly’s platform and their traffic flow. According to CW1, employees at Fastly can track how much traffic a customer is using through an internal tool known as the “Fastly App” and anyone managing those accounts would be able to see traffic flow. The app is mostly used by the customer success and engineering teams to analyze performance. CW7 explained the Company also held weekly Customer Ops meetings, since at least as far back as 2022, to address customer issues and track bandwidth usage (i.e., how much traffic was being transmitted through Fastly’s platform) brought in by top clients, which took place every Thursday, typically at either 10 or 11 a.m. PT. These meetings were attended by around fifty to seventy-five people via Zoom and were recorded and uploaded to the Company’s intranet for individuals unable to attend the meeting live. These meetings were cross-functional and included Account Managers, Technical Account Managers, Engineers, Customer Operations, and Sales team members. During the meetings, account managers would present the amount of bandwidth (also referred to as the “throughput”) that each customer was using and Fastly used a red/yellow/green system to indicate how much bandwidth its top customers were using, with red representing a customer who was not using as much bandwidth as expected or desired. A slide deck, compiled by Fastly’s Vice President of Customer Support, Kami Richey, was always used at the meetings, showing each client’s name and their color status. Every week, the Vice President of Customer Support gathered throughput data from the Account Managers, who monitored those numbers daily, and put that information in the slide deck. During the meetings, Account Managers or Technical Account Managers typically provided the overview, with Account Managers talking about their top customers. If a major customer had opened a support ticket, that would also be a key topic of discussion and an engineering employee would provide a summary of the issue and the steps being taken to resolve it. A support person also would present on the top support tickets and big customer tickets. The meetings would also include discussion about any type of security incident that would affect everyone. Fastly’s Chief Customer Officer, Kim Ogletree, and the Vice President of Global Customer Success, Windy Mesquita, regularly attended these meetings. Nightingale would also occasionally join the meetings. If a major enterprise customer remained in “red” status week after week, the Chief Customer Officer, Vice President of Global Customer Success, and Vice President of Customer Support would assemble a “tiger team” to focus on improving the customer’s performance. CW7 recalled that by March 2023, Ticketmaster was one larger enterprise customer that consistently had issues with Fastly’s services, was labeled “red” status in terms of throughput usage, and frequently threatened to cancel its contract with Fastly. These issues dated as far back as November 2022, with CW7 describing an incident involving Taylor Swift “Eras Tour” tickets, and Ticketmaster’s system crashing due to several backend technical failures. CW7 explained Ticketmaster blamed Fastly for the issue. In addition, according to CW1, it was well known throughout the Company, beginning in some point during 2023, that the Company was at high risk of eventually losing TikTok as a customer because TikTok had begun “building out their own network,” which would result in TikTok transitioning off of Fastly at some point. According to CW1, after the Q1 2024 results were released, the Company’s leaders set up a “war room” and “tiger team,” headed by the Chief Customer Officer, Kim Ogletree, to address the substantial drop in traffic from the Company’s bigger customers. The tiger team was made up of employees involved with “customer success.” In subsequent all hands meetings, CW6 recalled Nightingale discussing how several of the Company’s top ten accounts were simultaneously reducing usage. The Company Struggles to Acquire New Customers As revenue from existing customers, including the Company’s largest customers, declined, the Company shifted its sales teams’ focus towards acquiring new business, despite the fact that the vast majority of the Company’s revenue was historically derived from existing customers and Defendants continued to publicly emphasize that the Company was driving revenue growth from existing customers. Behind the scenes, according to CW6, Nightingale and the new Chief Revenue Officer put together teams to try to obtain business from several bigger companies in 2024. Further, according to CW1, CW2, CW3, and CW4, Fastly reconfigured its sales compensation plan in 2024 in a manner that prioritized revenue secured from new accounts (also referred to as new “logos”) over revenue generated from existing customers, thereby discouraging sales team members from continuing to attempt to drive growth from existing clients. According to CW4, prior to 2024, the sales compensation model weighed all additional revenue a sales employee secured equally, regardless of whether it was generated from a new or existing customer. Under the new model implemented in 2024, sales employees received fifty percent more pay on revenue acquired from new customers, while the pay-out for revenue gained from cross-sells, upsells, and renewals was substantially lowered. CW2 explained revenue secured from renewals, cross-sells, and upsells was no longer a significant factor because the Company was only counting new logos. CW1 corroborated that “the entire focus of the organization shifted to new business” and “[i]t was almost punitive to continue to work with your existing clients.” CW4’s boss explained to CW4 and CW4’s colleagues that the basis for the new compensation plan was that Fastly needed to acquire new customers in order to succeed. However, according to CW1, new business “dried up” and started “falling off a cliff” during Q4 2023. No new contracts were being signed. CW1 explained potential customers were"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Vicor is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. Vicor designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and complete power systems that deliver and/or manage electrical power for deployment in, among other areas, high-performance computing, industrial equipment and automation, robotics, unmanned and manned vehicles, and satellites. Patrizio Vinciarelli founded Vicor in 1981 and has served as President and CEO of Vicor since its founding. Vicor’s stock is actively traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Upwards of a million Vicor shares were traded every day on average between March and October 2023, with that number exceeding 4.5 million in a single day following the disclosures at issue in this lawsuit. Vicor is followed and rated by several analysts, including, but not limited to, Craig-Hallum, Needham, CJS Securities, BWS Securities, and Northland Capital Markets. Previously, Vicor’s two largest customers had been Google and Nvidia. One of Vicor’s significant feats early on was having its power-management components featured as part of Nvidia’s Artificial Intelligence chips—Nvidia’s Flagship Datacenter AI GPUs—and in Google’s 48V server infrastructure. When Nvidia’s new AI chips emerged in 2022 but did not feature Vicor’s power designs or components, Vicor’s shares slid over 20%, starting on March 23, 2022, with the trend continuing thereafter. By early 2023, many market commentators who follow the industry, and those who follow Vicor specifically, were questioning the continued reliability of the relationship between Vicor and Nvidia or Google. Through July 2023, according to its public SEC filings, Vicor repeatedly failed to achieve expected milestones, its order backlog shrunk with new orders not replacing the older ones as they were delivered, and revenue declined. For example, on February 22, 2024, Vicor reported in a press release that “Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $92.7 million, a 12.2% decrease from $105.5 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and a 14.1% sequential decrease from $107.8 million in the third quarter of 2023” and that “Backlog for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $160.8 million, a 47.2% decrease from $304.4 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and 8.0% sequential decrease from $174.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023.” Soon after that, in its 10Q released in May 2023, Vicor explained that: Backlog, which represents the total value of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately $271,283,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2023, as compared to $304,392,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022… …and Net revenues decreased 7.3% to $97,816,000 for the first quarter of 2023, from $105,493,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net revenues for Brick Products increased 10.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the ability to shift manufacturing resources to focus on available backlog, as well as favorable market conditions. Advanced Products net revenue decreased 19.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to continued supply constraints leading to longer cycle-times and schedule delays. … Gross margin decreased to $46,534,000 for the first quarter of 2023 from $49,139,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022, but gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 47.6% for the first quarter of 2023 from 46.6% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in gross margin dollars and the increase in gross margin percentage were primarily a result of the unfavorable impact from lower sales volume offset by reduced freight-in and tariff spending of $3,927,000 (net of approximately $3,000,000 in duty drawback recovery of previously paid tariffs). Vicor further reported $4.5 million fewer accounts receivable for that period in this same filing. These reflected a continuing trend in Vicor’s performance that was cemented by the fact that it had lost its relationship with Nvidia and Google. Thus, to the common investor, Vicor’s stock appeared significantly overvalued given the business’s condition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated looked at Vicor’s downward trend as a core thesis for shorting Vicor’s stock. Each Plaintiff—and those similarly situated—took several short positions over the course of approximately twelve weeks starting on or around May 1, 2023. According to publicly available data, over three million shares had been sold short as of July 25, 2023. This does not include the number of short positions taken by investors via options positions or other derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. Shortly before trading closed on July 25, 2023, Vicor released its Q2 earnings report. Its companion press release on that day concluded with the first bit of real good news in a while: Commenting on second quarter performance, Chief Executive Officer Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q2 bookings remained weak, ahead of production release of an AI platform with a Lateral Power Distribution Network (‘PDN’) using a 4G ChiP-set, now expected to ramp in Q4. The same 4G ChiP-set will support a more adept Lateral-Vertical PDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy workloads and superior processor performance.” The message was plain: newly booked sales of the Lateral Power Distribution Network (itself a new product) would reverse the lengthy trend of “weak” sales. During Vicor’s 2023 Q2 earnings call after the market closed that same day, July 25, 2023, the analysts’ questions reflected that they received the same message: Good news—a customer had been confirmed for the new product. The only question the analysts wanted an answer to was how big of a customer. For example, Quinn Bolton, an analyst from Needham & Company who follows Vicor, asked Vinciarelli about how large a difference in sales this customer was likely to represent in the fourth quarter: Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. First question is, can you guys share any more details on the 4G lateral power distribution design that you mentioned in the press release for a new AI platform that ramps in the fourth quarter. Can you say, is this a new customer? Have you worked with this customer previously? Can you give us any sense of what our consumption is for this part? Is it a high power card? Is it a mid-range power card? Any details you can share would be very helpful. Patrizio Vinciarelli It’s an existing customer. It’s a new generation for the existing customer. And it’s a chipset that can be deployed either in a lateral PDN, which is substantially handicapped from a power system perspective to the point that it limits power delivery, power capability, process of performance, in that it gives rise to large losses within the copper of the substrate to the GPU, that it powers. It gives rise to further losses within the system itself, or into the limitations of lateral power delivery applied at the 1,000 amp level. With a 4G chipset, we can enable a lateral solution with the same handicaps, or with a vertical element using the same chipset, a lateral vertical solution, which is unique, highly differentiated, in that it improves system efficiency by about 10%. And it improves a number of limitations relating to process of performance [bolding added]. The question posed to Vinciarelli indicated that the market was focusing on the news that the new customer agreement would overcome the prior quarters’ weak sales. This was the only real positive news about Vicor in several quarters, and especially during that time frame. On that same call, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, John Dillon, again attempted to confirm the size of the customer with Vinciarelli who confirmed it was a large customer: John Dillon Okay, great. I want to follow up on Quinn’s question a little bit. . . . Regarding the lateral vertical opportunity that’s coming to production in Q4, is that a high-volume customer is more of a lower volume or more of a modest volume customer [sic]? Patrizio Vinciarelli So, to be clear, I’ve suggested earlier, the same chip set, which is a 4G chip set, supports both the lateral and the lateral vertical. Based on constant input expectation, as of now, is that the lateral implementation will go first. And that's the one we’re anticipating for the Q4 ramp. I can’t tell you when the lateral vertical was going to production, but my expectation is that it would be after the lateral. John Dillon Yes, but is this going to be a significant customer or is this more of an incremental volume that you’re going to expect? Patrizio Vinciarelli This is a significant customer [bolding added]. Throughout the call, Vicor admitted to the poor performance and prospects (namely, the radical decrease in orders in the prior quarters), but Vinciarelli explicitly touted that a “significant” “existing” customer had agreed to make product purchases, the delivery of which was slated to begin in Q4 2023. Vicor’s management—Vinciarelli included—gave specific details regarding the customer as if they were real, e.g., that the customer would use the lateral PDN implementation first and the lateral-vertical PDN implementation later. Management of Vicor gave additional, specific details that the customer would have power delivery “applied at the 1,000 amp level.” Management reiterated that this concerned an “existing” and “significant” Vicor customer seeking the “new generation” part. These details gave the unmistakable impression that a concrete deal had been reached for an existing—not speculative—large customer of a significant number of purchases in the fourth quarter, which would have reversed Vicor’s trend of declining and weak sales. Consistent with the messaging, the market took this information to suggest that Vicor had a new partnership deal with Nvidia or Google. The market’s reaction to this news was immediate and pronounced: whereas Vicor’s stock had closed on July 25, 2023, at $59 before the above earnings announcements, it then opened the next morning on July 26, 2023, at $77.40 and closed at the end of the day at $93.70, reaching an intra-day high of over $94. Average trading volume prior to and after July 26, 2023, had been consistent at around 800,000 to 1.2 million shares per day; but on July 26, 2023, volume exceeded 4.5 million shares, roughly five to six times higher than normal. Because of the skyrocketing price, and in reliance on the announcement of a new “significant customer” who was also an “existing customer,” each Plaintiff was forced to cover their short positions at a significant loss—roughly $35 per share on average, in addition to the roughly $15 per share they would have realized had they not needed to purchase cover. Plaintiffs were forced to cover their short positions in reliance on the news and the market’s overnight internalization of the news. On October 24, 2023, Vicor held its third quarter earnings call. On the call, Vicor failed to mention the customer discussed on the July 25, 2023 call. The analysts’ questions again confirmed what everyone had taken away from the July 25, 2023 call: Vicor had a confirmed big customer. In response, Vicor prevaricated. Vicor did not disclose that its supposed “existing” and “significant” customer had backed out or changed its mind; instead, Vicor denied that it ever said it had such a customer: [Analyst] Quinn Bolton Last quarter you guys seemed pretty excited about this new AI platform that you expected to ramp in the fourth quarter of 2023 and throughout 2024. Can you just give us any updates on that program? How are you feeling about it, is it still on track? Have you started to see more bookings associated for that? [Vicor Sr. VP of Sales] Philip D. “Phil” Davies So, Quinn, this is Phil. So, the first part of your question, I think, was what we talked about the last call. And my prepared remarks, I basically said that the first area of focus was to ramp in Q4, our 48-volt bus converters, and factorized power solutions. I hope that answers that question pretty clearly. . . . As I said, we’re having substantial conversations now with customers that will diversify us away from the two big guys that we’ve been doing business with, for the next -- for the last few years. So, as I said, I’m very confident in the future and where we stand and it’s a bit of a complex landscape. In his attempt to retreat from the prior call’s statement that Vicor had already landed a whale of a customer, Phil Davies, a senior manager at Vicor, pivoted away entirely and did not even attempt to explain what happened to the customer. John Dillon, the Goldman Sachs analyst, jumped in to reassert what was said on July 25th—and again, Vicor attempted to deny ever having made the representation: John Dillon So, with the one major customer though, do they have two different designs with you? One for . . . are they working with two different . . . the one customer, do they two different GPUs that are going to be used, in one using lateral, the other’s going to be using lateral-vertical? Or is the same GPU that’s initially going to use lateral, then going to lateral-vertical? Patrizio Vinciarelli John, we’re not going to talk about any one customer. I’m sorry, but bear with us, that’s not a level of specificity we want to get involved with. ….. John Dillon On the last call, you stated you had a lateral and a lateral-vertical opportunity with a major GPU customer. I was wondering, was that for the same GPU or was it for two separate GPUs? Phil Davies So what we talked about there was that we have lateral and lateral-vertical solutions for not just one customer. We are bringing that solution forward, and we have customers looking at that, both of those solutions. And certainly, the number of customers looking at lateral deployment is a little bit higher than the number with lateral-vertical, but we have both. Patrizio Vinciarelli And that’s also the way in which systems have evolved, but make no mistake. The future, and the future is coming next year, is no longer with lateral PDNs. Another analyst, Richard Shannon also reconfirmed that the prior call had evinced an existing customer relationship, which Vicor denied ever having represented: [Analyst] Richard Shannon Hi, Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Let’s see, a couple of questions. Maybe a follow-up on the topic of bookings here. I think last quarter, you felt fairly confident that the backlogs would improve either in the ending third quarter or fourth quarter. Now, it seems you’re less certain of that. And I think if I understood one of the answers to a prior question, you’re still expecting the design with a major customer to -- that is still active here. So, it seems like a couple of simple explanations for that would be either that design is delayed or your share of the size of the opportunity is more limited than what you initially had thought or potentially there’s other reasons. So, can you help us understand those dynamics relative to your last conference call? Patrizio Vinciarelli I think I made clear that we really don’t want to go into the level of detail. And to be clear, well, I appreciate the reason for the interest, the curiosity, it’s really got very little to do with Vicor’s opportunity in the medium and long term. And that’s what we’re really focused on. The questions make clear that the market and the analysts all heard the same thing on July 25th, and were now hearing the opposite. Vinciarelli’s pivot that the customer relationship announced on July 25, 2023, “had very little to do with” Vicor’s business “in the medium and long term” is shocking given how gung-ho he had been just three months earlier. Thus, when pressed to update the public statement made on July 25, 2023, that a “significant” and “existing” customer who had agreed to use two different kinds of implementations at the “1,000 amp level” would ramp up in Q4, Vicor essentially denied the existence of any such customer and pivoted to talk about no specific customer, disclosing only that it was “having substantial conversations with customers who will diversify us away from the two big guys we’ve been doing business with.” In other words, in a mere three-month span, Vicor went from representing that one of the “two big guys” was ramping up a new product with Vicor by Q4 2023, to Vicor talking to other customers so as to not rely on business with the “two big guys.” This corrective disclosure made clear to Plaintiffs and the market that the promised Q4 “ramp in” of a “significant customer” was false when made; investors fled. As seen in the above figure, the price for Vicor immediately fell over 20%. Vicor closed at $53.19 on October 24, 2023. Following the after-hours earnings call, Vicor opened the next day at $39.01. Whereas the number of shares trading on the days prior to October 24, 2023, was consistent with the average of around a million, the volume again approached 4.5 million shares on October 25, 2023 (as people exited), and then reverted to the mean days later. After this lawsuit was filed, Vicor issued a press release to further attempt to cover its tracks. In its statement, Vicor seemingly admitted what it had denied on October 24, 2023—that it had said there was a large customer. Vicor’s press release proceeded to explain that its July 25, 2023 announcement was true because it had just “booked” $30 million in “non-cancellable, non-returnable” orders from the customer, and was a “reflect[ion]” of what Vicor “understood to be” the customer’s “allocation for a new program.” The press release confounds more than it explains. The fact that the press release was released a year after the events in question and only because lawsuits had been filed itself is a basis to read the carefully selected verbiage very closely and with extreme skepticism. The details (if they can be called that) should have been disclosed a year before it was made—e.g., between July 25, 2023 and October 24, 2023, or at least as part of the July 25, 2023 call. The fact that they were not is telling. The fact that the July 25, 2023, announcement that Vicor had landed a significant customer for its new product was predicated on nothing more than Vicor’s subjective” understanding of the “customer’s plans—and not its actual purchases of product—is likewise telling. Had Vicor truly"

      "summary": "Robinhood is a financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. The company is known for its brokerage services, which customers typically access through apps installed on their mobile devices. In July 2021, Robinhood conducted a large IPO, offering 55 million shares of common stock to the public at a price of $38 per share for proceeds of over $2 billion. According to the Offering Documents, Robinhood’s mission was to “democratize finance for all.” The company claimed to be riding a profound transformation in how people think about money, driven by the emergence of younger investors and non-traditional investors such as “gig economy workers.” The pillars of Robinhood’s strategy to reach these new and/or non-traditional investors supposedly were: (i) a primary focus on the safety and reliability of Robinhood’s trading platform; (ii) a focus on the needs of smaller investors; (iii) a “radical” focus on responding to customer problems and feedback; and (iv) a willingness to make “bold bets” that challenge the status quo. Robinhood claimed that its strategy allowed it to achieve massive growth. The Offering Documents presented its revenue and key performance indicator (KPI) performance data through June 30, 2021, filling the Offering Documents with charts and tables depicting exponential growth. For example, the Offering Documents heavily touted the growth in Robinhood’s number of Monthly Active Users (MAU), which rose from 4.3 million by year end 2019, to 11.7 million by year end 2020, to 17.7 million by March 31, 2021, and which Robinhood stated would be 21.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, the quarter that ended the month before the IPO. Likewise, the Offering Documents emphasized the company’s revenue growth, which rose nearly sequentially quarter over quarter, from $244.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, to $269.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, to $317.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, to $522.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and to approximately $560 million (at the midpoint of the range provided by management) for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Similarly, the Offering Documents hyped the substantial increases observed in Robinhood’s total assets under custody (AUC), a figure representing the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, net of customer margin balances. The Offering Documents frequently noted how Robinhood’s AUC grew from approximately $14.1 billion in 2019 to nearly $63 billion in 2020 to $80.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone, before then stating that Robinhood’s AUC for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately $102.04 billion. Moreover, the Offering Documents touted the growth Robinhood experienced in its net funded cumulative accounts (NCFA), a metric Robinhood uses to assess customer engagement. The Offering Documents repeatedly note that Robinhood’s NCFA increased from 5.1 million to 12.5 million to 18 million for the period ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively, and further that Robinhood expected its NCFA to reach 22.5 million by June 30, 2021. Lastly, and relatedly, the Offering Documents play up the company’s rising average revenues per user (ARPU), which Robinhood contends correlates positively with deepening user engagement, by repeatedly noting the increases observed from, for example, $65.70 for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $108.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $137 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. In the months prior to the IPO, Robinhood’s performance metrics were plummeting as traders left the company in droves, and revenue cratered. Former employees at Robinhood explained that the company completely abandoned its stated principles. Rather than prioritize safety and reliability, Robinhood knowingly operated with insufficient controls or personnel, allowing fraud to run rampant on the platform and imperiling investor accounts. Rather than cater to the needs of small customers, Robinhood commodified them, deliberately undermining their decision-making process through app features designed to trigger rapid trading that generated fees for Robinhood at the expense of investors. Robinhood exposed inexperienced customers to more complex and dangerous trading products, such as options and margin trading because those products were lucrative for Robinhood and ignored the protests of Robinhood employees that such decisions were causing customers staggering losses. In the run-up to the IPO, Robinhood’s predatory tactics drove a swell of investor anger and attrition. Robinhood also saw a decline in its “net promote score” (NPS), reflecting the willingness of Robinhood investors to recommend Robinhood to new users, undermining a key driver of future growth. Furthermore, in June and July 2021, the two months prior to the IPO, Robinhood’s revenue and KPIs experienced severe deterioration. Specifically, Robinhood’s (1) MAUs declined nearly 11.62% between May 2021 and June 2021 and by 8.45% between June 2021 and July 2021; (2) crypto trading volume declined over 76% between May 2021 and June 2021 and by 56.67% between June 2021 and July 2021; (3) AUC declined overall by nearly 4.25%; and (4) customer base and usage, as measured by its NCFA, had completely stagnated, as Robinhood’s ARPU declined by at least $25.30, if not likely more. This deterioration, which was a matter of historical fact at the time of the IPO, directly contradicted Robinhood’s claims regarding the success of its strategy and the company’s growth. Robinhood was able to track these metrics in real-time or nearly so using an analytics platform that it developed and operates. Multiple confidential witnesses confirmed Robinhood tracked this performance data ahead of the IPO, observing, for example, that Robinhood’s MAU, net new customer, and funded account metrics were deteriorating while its customer attrition was increasing. The truth began to emerge on October 27, 2021, when the company revealed the sharp declines in its KPIs during its third quarter 2021 earnings call, resulting in the company’s stock dropping sharply. Jim Cramer commented that the earnings call made him “depressed” because “if you read the conference call, you’d think it was a fad . . . and if it’s a fad, well what can I say? They’ve got a lot of people, 22 million, but they don’t have a lot of money in their accounts.” The market learned more about the dismal state of Robinhood’s strategy in the following months as the company continued to report declining KPIs and revenue. Commenting on the trend in January 2022, JP Morgan concluded that Robinhood is “a growth company without the growth.” As shown in the chart below, the company’s shares have traded as low as $6.81 per share since the IPO, representing a decline of more than 82% from the Offering Price of $38. By this action, Lead Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other members of the Class (defined below) who also acquired Robinhood’s shares pursuant and traceable to the Offering, now seek to obtain a recovery for the damages suffered as a result of Defendants’ violations of the Securities Act, as alleged herein.",

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of SunPower Corporation during the period from August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and who suffered damages as a result of the conduct alleged herein. The action is brought against SunPower, Peter Faricy (“Faricy”), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, and Manavendra S. Sial (“Sial,” together with Faricy “Individual Defendants,” and Individual Defendants collectively with the Company, “Defendants”), the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Executive Vice President, for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. During the Class Period, Defendants violated §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5, by making false and misleading statements and omissions concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial guidance; and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components. SunPower describes itself as a solar energy company that delivers complete solar solutions to customers primarily in the United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options, as well as “Smart Energy” solutions. The Company was founded in 1985, and held its Initial Public Offering on November 16, 2005. The Company’s stock has traded on the NASDAQ since 2005 under the symbol “SPWR.” In 2011, SunPower became a majority-owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies Solar INTL SAS (“TotalEnergies”). The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of solar energy generation, storage, and use products and services in what is called the downstream “Distributed Generation” or “DG” residential (often referred to as “resi”) and commercial markets. SunPower, which in 2020 divested its manufacturing business, Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (“Maxeon”), relies on key technology and components from a limited number of third-party suppliers to incorporate into the hardware it sells (or leases) to its customers. At the start of the Class Period, the Company divided its business into three main segments: Residential, Light Commercial (“RLC”); Commercial and Industrial Solutions (either “CIS” or “C&I,” sometimes described as the large or heavy commercial portion of the business); and “Others.” SunPower, and the financial analysts that follow the Company, frequently referred to the “light commercial” portion of SunPower’s RLC business as “Light Commercial Value-Added Reseller” or “CVAR.” For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the Company reported $1.125 billion in total revenue. Approximately $848 million (~75% of total revenues) of that total was generated from the RLC segment; $255 million (~23%) from CIS; and $66 million (~5.9%) from “Others.” The quality of SunPower’s products, which SunPower warrants, and SunPower’s “leadership” in the commercial market, were important points of differentiation for the Company. As Wells Fargo reported in a June 29, 2022 analyst report titled “SPWR: Initiating Coverage with an Underweight Rating,” “SunPower has historically differentiated its offering based on hardware (Maxeon panels and Enphase micro-inverters), commercial leadership (voted top provider), and an integrated warranty contract that covers all components (panels, inverters, batteries).” On April 19, 2021, Defendant Faricy became CEO, President and a member of SunPower’s Board of Directors. Faricy took over at a time of uneven performance for the Company, and in his first two conference calls with analysts and investors he described his focus as “diving deep” into SunPower’s residential and commercial business segments: [5/5/21 call:] “My focus over the next 100 days will center around diving deep into the residential and commercial, and industrial businesses.” [5/13/21 call:] “In the near term, my focus over the next 100 days will center around diving deep into the residential, commercial and industrial businesses.” During the Class Period, beginning with the Company’s reporting of its 2Q21 financial results on August 3, 2021, Defendants falsely asserted (or omitted to state facts necessary to make the statements not misleading), among other things, that the Company’s commercial business was performing well and was currently on track for the Company to meet its financial guidance. In a press release issued that day, Faricy was quoted as stating: “‘Our solid second quarter results reflect continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses . . . .’” “‘[W]e remain on track to achieve our 2021 financial outlook and are well positioned to drive growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond.’” Also on August 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s financial results and guidance. During the call, Sial also falsely told investors that the heavy commercial or CIS business was performing well, in particular representing that the commercial segment’s margin performance was “significantly better”: I think the business is significantly better year-on-year, both from a top line perspective as well as a margin point of view. And then more importantly, we expect the CIS business to be profitable in the back half of the year, which you recall is a significant turnaround from the last couple of years. The next day, on August 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective: “The failure of a supplier to supply . . . components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.” “If we have quality issues with our solar and related products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed.” “[D]efects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty, and re-engineering costs.” “[W]e may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers’ warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs.” “[P]otential future product or component failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products or components.” “Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.” “[Q]uality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.” On October 5, 2021, Defendants held a conference call to announce that they were exploring “strategic options” for the CIS business segment, indicating that Defendants were considering selling it. Defendants nevertheless continued to tout the ongoing strength of SunPower’s commercial business and affirmed that CIS was indeed “a point of strength” and “very healthy.” On November 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s 3Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Faricy falsely described the state of the Company’s operations and balance sheet, stating: Over the past few years, you’ve been with us through several major restructuring events and strategic changes. I’m pleased to report we have found our footing. With a streamlined company and our healthiest balance sheet in years, we are now going on offense to grow our business across a vast, mostly untapped residential TAM. On November 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. Like the quarterly report for 2Q21, the 3Q21 Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective: “The failure of a supplier to supply… components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.” “If we have quality issues with our solar and related products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed.” “[D]efects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty, and re-engineering costs.” “[W]e may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers’ warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs.” “[P]otential future product or component failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products or components.” “Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.” “[Q]uality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.” Each of the above representations concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial guidance; and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components was materially false and misleading when made because Defendants knew or deliberately disregarded and failed to disclose the following facts: (a) cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems had already developed in nearly all of the Company’s commercial systems; (b) as a result of the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems, SunPower would be required to incur tens of millions in costs to replace those defective third-party components; and (c) in light of (a) and (b) above, SunPower was not on track to achieve its FY21 financial guidance. Throughout the Class Period, the Company’s stock price traded at artificially inflated prices as high as $34.61. Based on Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions, investors expected that the Company’s commercial business was and would continue to be a key driver of revenue and margin growth, and that the Company’s financial results would not be negatively affected by already existing product defects. The artificial inflation of the Company’s stock price was maintained by Defendants’ continued boasting of the strength of the commercial business, as the truth about the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems remained concealed from the investing public. On December 7, 2021, SunPower published to its website the latest edition of its manual for Safety and Installation Instructions for the United States and Canada. The manual contained newly added language concerning cracking in connectors not present in the 2019 or 2020 editions of the United States and Canada manual. The December 7, 2021 manual included the following new warnings: “Do not allow the connectors to come in contact with chemicals such as greases, oils and organic solvents which may cause stress cracking.” “Connectors are factory assembled with intentional gaps between the cable nut and the body of the connector. Do not retighten module connector nuts as this may lead to stress cracking of the connector assembly and will void the warranty.” In addition, the December 7, 2022 manual added new advisories concerning best practices for safely handling connectors, such as: “For connectors, which are accessible to untrained people, it is imperative to use the locking connectors and safety clips, if applicable, in order to defend against untrained personnel disconnecting the modules once they have been installed.” “Avoid exposure of electrical connections to direct sunlight and do not place the connector in a location where water could easily accumulate.” After December 7, 2021, the Company’s stock price continued to trade at artificially inflated prices above $18 per share. Then, on January 20, 2022, SunPower issued a press release preannouncing that it would miss its earnings guidance for 4Q21 and FY21 and expected approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 due to “cracking” problems in products across its commercial business segments: “Through a product quality assessment, the company has identified a cracking issue that developed over time in certain factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment supplied to SunPower. . . . SunPower expects approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 as it pursues recovery of costs from the suppliers.” The release also noted that SunPower, no doubt in response, had hired a new executive to oversee the Company’s supply chain. Following SunPower’s January 20, 2022 preannouncement, financial analysts were quick to report on the scope and timing of the problem. “[N]early all” of SunPower’s commercial solar systems were affected, which would cost an estimated $31 million and require replacement throughout 2022. Importantly, analysts reported that Defendants must have learned about the pervasive problem of cracking in third-party components in conducting due diligence pursuant to selling the CIS business segment, if not earlier. For example: January 21, 2022, Roth Capital Partners report: After market hours on 1/20, SPWR preannounced Q4’21 results to the downside and detailed the company’s expectations for (1) charges of ~$31mn (~$27mn in Q4’21 and ~$4mn in Q1’22) related to the proactive replacement of third-party connectors experiencing a “cracking issue” for nearly all C&I systems since 2019. . . . Overall thoughts. Given the overall negative sentiment in the sector, look for the stock to be weak. . . . We believe SPWR may need to retrofit ~1,000+ sites representing close to ~9MW (our guesstimate). Downside Q4’21 preannouncement. SPWR reiterated its prior Q4’21 revenue guidance of $361-421mn, but noted that Q4’21 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be at the low end of the previous guidance of $18-41mn. Management attributed the lowered outlook for adjusted EBITDA to (1) $6.5mn of resi EBITDA effectively pushed into 2022 due to weather in California and Covid impacts and (2) an additional $3mn invested in sales and marketing in Q4’21 to expand in “underpenetrated areas nationally.” January 20, 2022, Truist Securities report: SPWR Addressing 3P Quality Concerns. . . . SPWR has identified a cracking issue in certain connectors within third party commercial equipment supplied to the company. . . . As the company is pursuing the sale of its CIS business, we wouldn’t be surprised if such findings were revealed in a due diligence process, though we note SPWR specifically indicated the issue was identified in a product quality assessment. January 21, 2022, Cowen Equity Research report: SunPower disclosed a quality issue with some of its commercial equipment. The company noted that a third party connector that was installed at the factory has developed cracking issue. . . . Our sense is this issue needs to be resolved before the intended sale of the C&I division occurs and likely came up in due diligence. In response to the aftermarket January 20, 2022 disclosures, SunPower’s stock price declined from a close of $19.02 on January 20, 2022, to $15.80 on January 21, 2022, a 16.9% drop, on more than 11.4 million shares trading volume as compared to only 2.8 million shares traded on January 20, 2022. Members of the putative class seek to recover their economic losses as a result of the conduct alleged herein.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"ImmunityBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of immunotherapies to treat cancer and other infectious diseases. Immunotherapies refer to a broad class of drugs that complement or stimulate the body’s immune system to fight disease, like cancer, and have become increasingly common in the field of oncology in recent years, particularly in combination with standard cancer therapies. ImmunityBio’s lead product candidate is a compound known as N-803 marketed under the trade name Anktiva. As it currently exists, ImmunityBio was formed in connection with a business combination between a separate entity by the name of ImmunityBio, Inc. (“Legacy ImmunityBio”) and NantKwest, Inc. (“NantKwest”) in March 2021. At the time of this business combination, both companies were majority owned by entities controlled by Defendant Soon-Shiong and was, effectively, a merger between two of the many businesses within his family of companies. Defendant Soon-Shiong is a former surgeon, scientist, biotech mogul, and media tycoon known for his ownership of the Los Angeles Times and his interest in the Los Angeles Lakers. He achieved fantastic success approximately twenty years ago inventing and bringing to market a novel cancer treatment known as Abraxane. In 1998, his start-up, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (“APP”), acquired Fujisawa USA and used its ties to hospital buyer groups to generate revenues from Fujisawa’s money-losing portfolio of injectable generic drugs, which, in turn, APP used to develop Abraxane. APP went public in 2001. In 2005, the FDA approved Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer. Following a merger with American BioScience, Inc., Soon-Shiong split the company into Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (“Abraxis BioScience”), which focused on Abraxane and other proprietary products, and APP Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“APP Pharmaceuticals”), which focused on the injectables business. In 2008, he sold APP Pharmaceuticals to Fresenius SE for approximately $5.6 billion. In 2010, he sold Abraxis BioScience to Celgene for approximately $3.6 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved Abraxane for the treatment of several other forms of cancer. By 2019, Abraxane was generating over $1 billion in annual sales. In 2011, Soon-Shiong was free to pursue his other interests and formed NantWorks LLC (“NantWorks”), among other ventures, to do so. It now serves as a holding company for a collection of healthcare, technology, and finance companies. In November 2014, Soon-Shiong formed Legacy ImmunityBio as a NantWorks subsidiary under the name NantBioCell, LLC to focus on next generation cancer immunotherapies. It later changed its name to Legacy ImmunityBio in May 2019. For ease of reference, all predecessors to Legacy ImmunityBio will be referred to herein as Legacy ImmunityBio. Soon-Shiong’s interest in NantKwest began around the same time that he formed Legacy ImmunityBio. In December 2014, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company by the name ConKwest, Inc. (“ConKwest”) announced that Soon-Shiong made a $48 million investment in its business. At the time, ConKwest was developing a proprietary line of enhanced natural killer cells for off-the-shelf commercialization. Soon-Shiong quietly assumed the title of Chief Medical Officer and CEO between January and March 2015. He made another $71 million investment in June 2015. In July 2015, ConKwest changed its name to NantKwest and commenced an IPO at a market valuation of $2.6 billion. Upon completing the IPO, Soon-Shiong and/or entities his affiliates owned over 60% of NantKwest. Soon after NantKwest went public, Soon-Shiong began to court Altor BioScience Corporation (“Altor”) after learning that it was developing several compounds that act on cytokines which help regulate the immune system, including a cytokine fusion protein known as ALT-803. Throughout early 2016, Soon-Shiong worked closely with Altor to bring their products into a cancer research coalition he created. In April 2016, he was named Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. By the end of 2016, entities controlled by Soon-Shiong had acquired over 50% of the equity in Altor. At the time Soon-Shiong took majority control of Altor, ALT-803 was being evaluated in several late-stage Phase 2 trials for various forms of cancer, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (“NMIBC”). In May 2017, ALT-803 received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in combination with a standard cancer vaccine, baccilus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”), based on the data generated in Phase 1 clinical trials. The FDA’s Fast Track program is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions, like cancer, and fill unmet medical needs. In or around July 2017, Legacy ImmunityBio acquired Altor, including its lead cytokine-based therapeutic compound, ALT-803, and continued to develop it under the name N-803. At the time, a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG had just begun in BCG unresponsive patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC. In December 2019, N-803 in combination with BCG received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in patients who were unresponsive to BCG based on interim data indicating that the primary endpoint of the Phase 2 trial was already met mid-study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and preliminary clinical evidence shows a substantial improvement over available therapy. By August 2020, N-803 was known internally as Anktiva. Since its IPO in 2015, NantKwest experienced a number of setbacks and had not materially progressed its proprietary line of natural killer cell therapies. With Anktiva moving much faster through the clinical development and regulatory process, Soon-Shiong decided to use NantKwest as the vehicle to take Legacy ImmunityBio and its product portfolio public. On December 21, 2020, the two companies issued a joint press release announcing that they agreed to merge in a stock-for-stock merger. That same day, Legacy ImmunityBio announced that preliminary data from the Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG showed that the study already achieved its primary endpoint for patients with in situ forms of NMIBC. The Legacy ImmunityBio-NanktKwest merger closed on March 9, 2021. In connection with the transaction, a subsidiary of NanktKwest merged with and into Legacy ImmunityBio, and NanktKwest changed its name to ImmunityBio. It assumed the assets of Legacy ImmunityBio, including Anktiva, and its publicly traded shares continued to be listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol IBRX as of March 10, 2021. Immediately following the closing of the transaction, Defendant Soon-Shiong or affiliates controlled by him beneficially owned approximately 82% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Before a new drug can be introduced into interstate commerce for commercial purposes, it must be approved by the FDA. The FDA’s rules and regulations distinguish between chemically-synthesized drugs, known as “small molecule” drugs, and therapies derived from living material, known as “biologics.” In contrast to small molecule drugs, the means used to request FDA approval for a biologic, like Anktiva, is a biologic license application (“BLA”). The contents of a BLA must conform to strict guidelines outlined in FDA rules and associated guidance. Generally speaking, a BLA includes data and supporting materials collected in clinical trials, along with other information needed for the FDA to determine that the product meets prescribed standards for approval, including information on the manner in which the product is manufactured. In practice, a new BLA is a voluminous compendium of materials, and usually includes raw study data, historic records, written summaries, and academic literature, among other things, organized using a specific format adopted by the FDA. The section of the BLA that describes the manufacturing process and integrity of the drug is known as the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) section of the BLA. Unlike small molecule drugs, biologics are structurally complex materials that are not clearly defined or characterized. The process used to manufacture these materials at scale involves an array of highly technical steps, each of which must be carefully controlled to ensure a consistent final product free from impurities. Accordingly, the CMC section contains extensive information on the overall process, including, among other things, a full description of the manufacturing processes from start to finish, in-process controls used at each step, analytical methods used to test the product for release at various stages, and stability testing to show that the product remains true to form at regular intervals following final release, along with supporting documentation for each. The CMC section of the BLA not only describes the proposed process and protocols for manufacturing at scale, but also must include data generated in connection with previously-produced process performance qualification (“PPQ”) batches using the stated manufacturing processes and equipment. The purpose of such a qualification study is to validate that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of reproducing results within predetermined specifications at commercial scale. Importantly, the FDA is not authorized to approve a BLA unless it can determine from the materials submitted that the manufacturing process complies with cGMP. cGMP refers to the collection of minimum procedures and practices set forth in FDA regulations, that companies must follow to ensure that the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs is well-controlled. The FDA has stated that these standards and practices assure the “identity, strength, quality, and purity” of drugs and prevent “contamination, mix-ups, deviations, failures, and errors.” Any drug manufactured using systems that fail to comply with these well-known and long-standing cGMP regulations are deemed “adulterated,” subjecting the party who is responsible for the failure to adverse regulatory action. Once submitted, the time for the FDA to act on the BLA is governed by various rules. In the first instance, the FDA will decide within 60 days if the BLA is sufficiently complete to “file” it for substantive review. If the FDA decides to file a BLA, the deadline for the FDA to act on it is determined by the goal dates set forth in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended (“PDUFA”). The version of PDUFA in effect at the time of the Anktiva BLA (PDUFA VI) directed the FDA to act on 90% of new BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day “filing” date, unless the BLA is designated as a “priority” submission which truncates the timeline to 6 months from the 60-day “filing” date. Development programs that receive Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations are ordinarily eligible for, although not automatically entitled to, priority review under PDUFA. As part of the review process, the FDA will also conduct a “pre-license inspection” of each facility used to manufacture the drug at a prescheduled time during the review period. The purpose of this inspection is to ensure that the facilities comply with applicable regulations, including cGMP. Any cGMP failures identified during the inspection can prevent the issuance of a license for the product. Pre-license inspections follow a standard protocol. Staff carry out their responsibilities not only by observing the site in operation but also by reviewing appropriate records at the facility reflecting past activities. Given the significance of this visit, many manufacturers hold mock inspections, perform cGMP audits, or otherwise shore up compliance gaps in advance of the FDA review period to minimize the risk for any adverse observations. After completing its review, the FDA will either approve the BLA or send the sponsor a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL outlines any issues identified by the FDA during the review that prevent approval of the BLA in its current form and, where possible, recommend actions that a sponsor may take to remedy the issues or otherwise position the application for approval. Upon receipt of a CRL, the applicant may resubmit the BLA with amendments to address the stated deficiencies or withdraw it. 1. ImmunityBio Actively Planned to File a BLA for Anktiva by No Later Than the Start of the Class Period As noted above, ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva in July 2017 upon completing its acquisition of Altor. At the time of that acquisition, Altor had recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG in BCG unresponsive patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC. By early December 2020, ImmunityBio learned from interim data that the Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG already achieved its primary endpoint for patients with in situ forms of NMIBC with no treatment-related adverse events. Thus, by no later than December 2020, ImmunityBio knew that it was reasonably likely that the Company would file a BLA for Anktiva upon final completion of the study. Indeed, in the release announcing the initial results on December 21, 2020, Soon-Shiong stated “[w]e expect to file a Biologics License Application following a meeting with the FDA in 2021,” likely a reference to a “pre-BLA” meeting during which ImmunityBio can gain input from the FDA on the content and format of an anticipated BLA. In fact, the release included the following headline: “Biologics License Application anticipated in second half of 2021.” This precipitated a flurry of activity in 2021. On or around August 11, 2021, ImmunityBio appointed Soon-Shiong to the newly-created position of Global Scientific and Medical Officer. In this new role, Soon-Shiong assumed responsibility for clinical development. On September 13, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release disclosing that updated data from the Phase 3 study of Anktiva with BCG continued to show favorable data with no treatment-related adverse events in the in situ cohort. Then, at the end of November 2021, ImmunityBio submitted a briefing document to the FDA with updated data from that study. Such briefing material must be submitted to the FDA at least one month before a pre-BLA meeting. ImmunityBio subsequently had discussions with the FDA about its forthcoming BLA. On December 17, 2021, NantCapital, LLC, a Soon-Shiong investment vehicle, provided $300 million in financing to ImmunityBio. The release announcing this stated that the financing came directly “from ImmunityBio’s founder . . . Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong.” In addition, the release stated that the Company “anticipates a BLA filing . . . in Q1, 2022” and noted that recent financing would be used to “expand our commercial operations in anticipation of our bladder cancer BLA filing in Q1, 2022.” On May 23, 2022, ImmunityBio announced that it submitted a BLA to the FDA for Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive patients with the in situ form of NMIBC. The BLA included the results of previous clinical studies in that population, including the recently completed Phase 3 study, as well as at least three previously-completed PPQ runs for Anktiva at the facility where Anktiva was made. ImmunityBio requested priority review of the BLA. The FDA accepted the BLA for filing in late July 2022, and assigned it a target PDUFA date of May 23, 2023. In other words, the FDA put the BLA on a standard 10 month review. The Individual Defendants Were Well-Aware of the Critical Role That cGMP Compliance Played in Securing BLA Approval Like most anyone with a working knowledge of the FDA approval process, much less seasoned biotech executives, the Individual Defendants were well-aware of the FDA’s cGMP regulations at all relevant times. On January 29, 2021, Defendants Soon-Shiong and Adcock acknowledged in regulatory filings made with the SEC that any manufacturing facility for products that it develops are subject to “all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP,” and specified that “cGMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation.” The Individual Defendants, including Defendant Sachs, continued to make the same, or substantially similar, statements in each annual report on Form 10-K filed on behalf of ImmunityBio during the Class Period. Throughout the Class Period, the Individual Defendants also knew demonstrating compliance with cGMP was mission critical to securing approval from the FDA for a new biologic product, like Anktiva. In the same regulatory filings referenced above, the Individual Defendants admitted that “[t]he FDA will not approve an application [BLA] unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities comply with cGMP requirements.” In this regard, the Individual Defendants were privy to the fact that the FDA makes its cGMP assessment based not only on the manufacturing data that must be included in a BLA but also on the results of an in-person inspection of the facility while in use during the review period. In the same regulatory filings referenced above, the Individual Defendants advised that a “BLA/NDA must include . . . detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling,” including “quality control documentation” generated by the facility that manufactures the product and that “[m]anufacturing facilities must submit to pre-approval inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications, including our BLAs” to demonstrate that they are compliant with cGMP. Indeed, they specified that the purpose of such inspections was to “assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidates’ continued safety, quality, purity and potency.” At the time ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva from Altor, its production was outsourced to a predecessor of AGC Biologics, Inc. (“AGC”), a third-party CMO that provided manufacturing services for protein therapies which was recently acquired by Asahi Glass Company. Indeed, just two months earlier, in April 2017, Altor entered into a manufacturing agreement with that CMO to manufacture Anktiva for use in upcoming Phase 3 trials. At the time, Defendant Soon-Shiong was Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. Following a corporate reorganization in January 2018, that CMO was renamed AGC. Upon acquiring Altor, ImmunityBio continued to rely on AGC to manufacture Anktiva. As CW1 explained, AGC “originated” the technology for producing the active ingredient in Anktiva and, thus, it would be exceedingly expensive and risky to transfer that technology in-house, particularly with Phase 3 clinical trials recently started. This was echoed by CW2, who observed it would be “extremely difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to switch to another manufacturer at that point.” By the start of the Class Period in March 2021, AGC manufactured the bulk drug substance for Anktiva. In contrast to a final drug product, which includes both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials used for delivery, appearance, or taste, e.g., tablet coating, saline solution, etc., drug substance refers strictly to the active pharmaceutical ingredient. According to CW2, once released by AGC quality personnel, drug substance for Anktiva was shipped by AGC in"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This case is about fraudulent accounting related to approximately $2.2 million in shipping expenses, which resulted in materially misleading financial statements being filed with the SEC and made available to the public. The furniture retailer Lovesac, its former CFO and Executive Vice President Donna Dellomo, and its former Controller and Vice President Yoon Um failed to properly account for “last mile” shipping expenses, which are the costs of shipping finished products from Lovesac’s distribution centers to its customers. Instead, Dellomo and Um engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obscure these expenses in the company’s books and records. In April 2023, Lovesac discovered that $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses were not properly recorded and reported in its previously published financial results for the periods in which they were incurred. These expenses had been inaccurately recorded in the company’s books and records for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Um, in concert with Dellomo, engaged in a scheme to hide these expenses from investors and the SEC. They did this to avoid missing Lovesac’s projected gross margin—an important financial metric that the company disclosed in its SEC filings and on earnings calls—and to avoid restating the company’s prior financial filings for the periods in which the expenses were incurred. To accomplish this scheme, Dellomo and Um improperly accounted for the expenses. Both Dellomo and Um, who are experienced financial professionals and certified public accountants, knew or were reckless in not knowing that the fraudulent accounting treatment they devised was not compliant with GAAP and rendered certain of Lovesac’s financial statements materially false and misleading. As part of the scheme, Dellomo also submitted a false and misleading management representation letter to Lovesac’s outside auditor and otherwise failed to alert Lovesac’s auditors to the fraudulent accounting for the $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses. Furthermore, Lovesac and Dellomo failed to implement sufficient internal controls over financial reporting that may have prevented or detected the fraudulent accounting. Ultimately, Lovesac was required to restate its financial statements for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to correct the fraud. As a result of the conduct alleged, Lovesac violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and associated rules. Dellomo violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and associated rules. Dellomo also aided and abetted Lovesac’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and associated rules. Um violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and associated rules. Um also aided and abetted Dellomo’s violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and associated rules, and Lovesac’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and associated rules. The SEC brings this action seeking permanent injunctions against the defendants, civil penalties, an order prohibiting Dellomo and Um from acting as officers or directors of any public company, an order barring Dellomo and Um from practicing as accountants before the SEC, and such other relief as the court may deem appropriate. Lovesac is a furniture company that designs, manufactures, and sells furniture comprised of modular couches called Sactionals and foam beanbag chairs called Sacs, as well as accessories. The company markets its products primarily through its website and showrooms at malls throughout the United States. It operates through a direct-to-consumer model, selling its products online and shipping directly to customers. Lovesac became a public company through an initial public offering in 2018. Its common stock is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on Nasdaq under the symbol “LOVE.” Lovesac files periodic reports with the SEC on Forms 10-K (annual financial statements), 8-K (current reports), and 10-Q (quarterly financial statements), among others. During the relevant period, Lovesac issued stock compensation to employees pursuant to a stock incentive plan for which a Form S-8 registration statement was filed with the SEC on July 8, 2022. Further, on June 26, 2023, Lovesac issued shares pursuant to the exercise of certain stock warrants. At all relevant times, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group was led by the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Donna Dellomo. Dellomo, an experienced financial professional and CPA, began her career as an auditor at various companies, and subsequently served as an accounting manager, corporate Controller, and CFO of another public company. Beginning in 2017, Dellomo served as Lovesac’s CFO, initially working to help prepare the company for its initial public offering in 2018. Between January and June 2023, Dellomo served as Lovesac’s Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President and oversaw the finance, accounting, administration and risk management, and legal departments at the company. She retired from Lovesac in June 2023, but after retiring, worked as a strategic consultant for Lovesac for a year through June 2024. During the relevant period, Dellomo’s direct reports included Um, who was hired in November 2022 as the company’s Controller. Um is also a CPA, and prior to serving as Lovesac’s Controller, Um was a Controller at another public company for two years and spent almost a decade in various auditing roles at a large public accounting firm before that. During her ten months as Lovesac’s Controller, Um and her reports were responsible for internal accounting functions. Um agreed to resign in July 2023 and left the company in September 2023. Lovesac’s fiscal year is the twelve-month period in which it reports quarterly and annual financial results. The company operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to February 1st. Lovesac reports financial results this way to account for increased sales during the November to January holiday season. Fiscal year 2023 was 52 weeks and ended on January 29, 2023, and fiscal year 2024 was 53 weeks and ended on February 4, 2024. A public company’s annual financial results based on the fiscal year are publicly reported on SEC Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as required by law. Public companies also report quarterly results for the four three-month quarters in each fiscal year. Lovesac’s fiscal year 2023 quarters consisted of the first quarter (or “Q1”) (February through April), the second quarter (or “Q2”) (May through July), the third quarter (or “Q3”) (August through October), and the fourth quarter (or “Q4”) (November through January). Quarterly financial results are often publicly reported in a SEC Form 8-K filed with the SEC and, for the first three quarters of the year, additionally reported on SEC Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, as required by law. Q4 results are incorporated into the annual Form 10-K. GAAP refers to the standard framework of guidelines for accounting used in the United States as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These principles set the rules for preparing, presenting, and reporting financial statements of public companies, ensuring consistency and transparency. GAAP is used by accountants, auditors, and the investing public to compare financial information across different organizations, maintaining uniformity in financial reporting. Required financial statements, such as Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, must be prepared in accordance with GAAP. If such financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, they are presumed to be misleading or inaccurate. An “accrual” reflects revenue earned or expenses incurred before the actual cash transaction has taken place. An accrual for a shipping expense would reflect a shipping expense incurred (i.e., when a product has been shipped by FedEx) but that has not yet been paid by the company. Gross margin is a financial metric that represents the difference between net sales (net sales refers to the sale of merchandise plus shipping and handling revenue less returns and discounts) and cost of merchandise sold and is expressed as a percentage of net sales. A higher gross margin indicates that a company is retaining more of its revenue after covering the direct costs associated with producing goods. Capitalization is an accounting concept that refers to the process of recording an expenditure as an asset rather than an expense. When an expense is capitalized, the underlying expense is spread out over the useful life of the asset instead of the full cost being recorded in the company’s books and records and reported in its financial statements. Capitalization is applied to expenditures that provide future economic benefits under certain circumstances. This contrasts with expenses that do not provide a future economic benefit, such as outbound shipping costs, that are recorded in the period in which the expenses were incurred and the revenue recognized. Amortization refers to the financial concept of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. This process records the cost of the asset over the period it is expected to generate economic benefits. The general ledger is a record of a company’s financial transactions, where all journal entries are recorded. A journal entry is the initial record of each of the company’s transactions, detailing the date, accounts affected, amounts, and a brief description. These journal entries are “posted” to the general ledger, which organizes them by account (such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses) and serves as the foundation for preparing a company’s financial statements, such as the balance sheet and income statement. “Last mile shipping” is the term used by Lovesac to reflect the cost of transporting Lovesac’s finished products from a distribution center to the customer. At all relevant times, Lovesac used large shipping companies like FedEx for its last mile shipping. With respect to last mile shipping expenses, Lovesac publicly disclosed in its FY 2023 Form 10-K that it “records the expenses for shipping and handling activities at the same time the Company recognizes revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of merchandise sold and include inbound freight and tariff costs relative to inventory sold, warehousing, and last mile shipping to our customers.” However, Lovesac’s accounting for last mile shipping expenses was inconsistent with this public disclosure, as was Dellomo and Um’s scheme to hide last mile shipping expenses. On average, there was at least a two-week delay between the shipping date (the date when a product was shipped by FedEx) and the invoice date (the date when the FedEx invoice was received by Lovesac). Lovesac accounted for this timing discrepancy through an accrual process whereby the company calculated and recorded a monthly estimate of shipping expenses incurred, but not yet recorded in its books and records. The accrual was later reconciled against actual amounts paid to shipping companies based on invoices. However, during the relevant period, Lovesac’s monthly accrual methodology was flawed and inconsistently applied. In certain circumstances, relevant shipment data for the period was not used in the shipping container count estimate and improper assumptions were used for the cost per shipment calculation. As a result, the estimated accrual was understated, which was not compliant with GAAP because the expenses incurred in the period were not properly recorded. In April 2023, while performing an analysis as part of Lovesac’s monthly financial closing process, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group employees discovered that last mile shipping expenses were significantly higher in Q1 2024 than what the company had previously budgeted for the month. Specifically, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group employees estimated that approximately $2.2 million of last mile shipping expenses were improperly recorded in Q1 2024 rather than having been recorded in FY 2023, the period in which they believed the expenses were actually incurred. On April 23, 2023, Dellomo, in an email to employees including members of the finance and accounting group, indicated that the out-of-period shipping expenses would cause Lovesac’s gross margin for Q1 2024 to be lower than expected. In the same email, Dellomo expressed concern about not meeting Lovesac’s 50.1% gross margin projection, which had been publicly disclosed by Lovesac during a March 28, 2023 earnings call. Minutes later, Dellomo forwarded her email to Um and requested that she investigate the issue. The next day, members of Lovesac’s finance and accounting group met to discuss the problem with last mile shipping expenses having been improperly recorded in Q1 2024. On April 25, 2023, Dellomo emailed Um and the same group, noting that the gross margin estimate for Q1 2024 was, as of that day, only 48.7%. This was 140 basis points lower than Lovesac’s Q1 2024 gross margin projection of 50.1%, which, as noted above, was publicly disclosed to investors during the March 28, 2023 earnings call. On or about April 25, 2023, Um and other members of Lovesac’s finance and accounting group concluded that there were approximately $2.2 million of last mile shipping invoices for shipping expenses incurred in FY 2023 that were not recorded until Q1 2024. On the same day, members of the finance and accounting group, including Dellomo and Um, discussed the $2.2 million out-of-period expenses and the impact on Lovesac’s gross margin for Q1 2024. Um stated in a Microsoft Teams chat that she could not justify, as an accounting matter, reversing the $2.2 million shipping expenses. Another finance and accounting group employee who reported to Um communicated to her that reversing the $2.2 million from the Q1 2024 books would be “a giant black eye for the auditors to pick out.” Also on April 25, Um communicated with a senior member of Lovesac’s financial planning and analysis (“FP&A”) group. Um told that individual, in a Microsoft Teams chat, that the only way to meet the Q1 2024 gross margin projection was to capitalize the $2.2 million last mile shipping expenses and amortize them evenly over the remaining three quarters of FY 2024 starting in Q2 2024. Um replied: “I just don’t know how I can support [it].” Indeed, capitalizing the $2.2 million in shipping expenses would not comply with GAAP because the expenses did not provide any future economic benefit. The following day, on April 26, 2023, in a Microsoft Teams chat with the same senior member of the FP&A group, Um stated that the company was going to miss its publicly disclosed gross margin projection for Q1 2024 unless the $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses were removed from Lovesac’s Q1 2024 financial results. Um additionally expressed concern over being fired from Lovesac because of the last mile shipping issue. Around the same time, in a Microsoft Teams chat with another finance and accounting group employee, Um expressed further concern over her job security. Also on April 26, 2023, Um and Dellomo again discussed the $2.2 million out-of-period expenses during a call and, working in concert, decided to remove the expenses from Lovesac’s Q1 2024 financial results. Their solution was to capitalize the expenses in the company’s general ledger and then amortize the total over the last three quarters of FY 2024 starting in Q2 2024. This was the same proposed accounting treatment that Um had indicated she could not justify the day before. This accounting treatment would have two consequences: first, it would improperly avoid the cost, time, and negative reflection on the company associated with reopening and restating the FY 2023 books to properly account for the expenses in the period they were actually incurred and, second, it would improperly allow the company to meet its previously disclosed Q1 2024 gross margin projection. After talking to Dellomo on April 26, Um again communicated with a senior member of Lovesac’s FP&A group to ask if the proposed accounting treatment would result in the Q1 2024 gross margin being the same as the publicly disclosed projection of 50.1%. On April 26, 2023, after consulting Dellomo on the details of the entry, Um improperly booked a journal entry in the company’s general ledger to capitalize the $2.2 million expenses as an asset with the plan to spread out the expenses over the last three quarters of FY 2024. Dellomo approved Um’s journal entry in Lovesac’s accounting system the following day, April 27, 2023. As a result of this improper journal entry, the company’s expenses in Q1 2024 were decreased by $2.2 million, which had the effect of meeting the Q1 2024 gross margin projection of 50.1%. This accounting treatment was not in compliance with GAAP and obscured the $2.2 million of out-of-period shipping expenses in the company’s 2024 books and records. In effect, Dellomo and Um improperly pushed the last mile shipping expenses into the future, even though they believed that they had been incurred in the prior fiscal year. With respect to the journal entry, Um stated in a Microsoft Teams chat: “I don’t know how to tell [Dellomo] I don’t feel comfortable with it[.]” She nevertheless booked the journal entry and stated that she hoped it would “do the trick” for Lovesac to meet its gross margin target for Q1 2024. On June 7, 2023, as the result of the inappropriate accounting treatment for the $2.2 million out-of-period last mile shipping expenses, Lovesac reported in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC that its gross margin for Q1 2024 was 50.1%, exactly as the company had earlier publicly disclosed. That same information was incorporated into Lovesac’s Form 10-Q for Q1 2024, filed with the SEC on June 9, 2023. With respect to journal entries, Dellomo, as Lovesac’s CFO, typically required detailed accounting support prior to approval. Contrary to Dellomo’s normal practice, no such accounting support was attached to Um’s journal entry. In particular, at the time the $2.2 million journal entry was made, Dellomo and Um did not perform a documented materiality analysis, i.e., a written analysis of whether the out-of-period last mile shipping expenses significantly impacted Lovesac’s FY 2023 financial results. Nor was there any other supporting documentation justifying the improper accounting treatment they devised. As a result of Dellomo and Um’s scheme, four of Lovesac’s public financial reports filed with the SEC were rendered materially false and misleading. Lovesac’s Form 10-K for FY 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023, was materially false and misleading because last mile shipping expenses were not included in the period in which they were actually incurred and the Form 10-K did not disclose material weaknesses in Lovesac’s internal accounting controls environment, including that management did not sufficiently implement, promote, monitor, or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures. A Form 8-K announcing Lovesac’s FY 2023 financial results, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2023, was materially false and misleading because last mile shipping expenses were not included in the period in which they were incurred and did not disclose material weaknesses in Lovesac’s internal accounting control environment including that management did not sufficiently implement, promote, monitor, or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures.

Binance Holdings Limited is a Cayman Islands limited liability company. Binance operates the Binance.com Platform, an international crypto asset trading platform. Binance operates through a number of subordinate or affiliated entities, in multiple jurisdictions, all tied to Zhao as the beneficial owner. BAM Management is a Delaware corporation and the parent of BAM Trading and other affiliated entities. When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, BAM Management was wholly owned by BAM Management Company Limited, a Cayman Islands company, which in turn was wholly owned by CPZ Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company that was owned and controlled by Zhao. Presently, Zhao continues to own 81 percent of BAM Management. BAM Trading is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida. It is wholly owned by BAM Management. BAM Trading holds 43 money transmitter licenses with U.S. jurisdictions, including this District. Zhao is a Canadian citizen who resides outside of the United States, is Binance’s founder, beneficial owner, and CEO, and was Chairman of BAM Trading’s and BAM Management’s Boards of Directors at least until approximately March 2022. Zhao also owns several entities that have regularly traded on the Binance Platforms. Between October 2022 and January 2023, Zhao personally received $62.5 million from one of the Binance bank accounts. Zhao has never been associated with any entity registered with the SEC. The Binance Platforms were founded and are maintained and operated by an opaque web of corporate entities, including those identified below, all of which are beneficially owned and controlled by Zhao, Binance’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and, at least through March 2022, the Chairman of BAM Trading’s and BAM Management’s Boards of Directors. Binance, d/b/a Binance.com, is a Cayman Islands limited liability company founded and owned by Zhao. Since at least July 2017, it has operated the Binance.com Platform, an international crypto asset trading platform. The Binance.com Platform markets itself as being available to customers in more than 100 countries. It currently offers trading in over 350 crypto assets and makes available various other investment opportunities involving crypto assets, including crypto asset securities. Binance operates through a number of subordinate or affiliated entities, in multiple jurisdictions, all tied to Zhao as the beneficial owner. Zhao has been publicly dismissive of “traditional mentalities” about corporate formalities and their attendant regulatory requirements. He has refused to identify the headquarters of Binance, claiming, “Wherever I sit is the Binance office. Wherever I meet somebody is going to be the Binance office.” According to Zhao, the concept of a formal corporate entity with a headquarters and its own bank account is unnecessary: “All of those things doesn’t have to exist for blockchain companies.” Notably, however, billions of dollars from the platforms flowed through dozens of Binance and Zhao-owned U.S.-based bank accounts. Neither Binance nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities have ever been registered with the SEC in any capacity. BAM Management is a Delaware corporation and the parent of BAM Trading and other affiliated entities. When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, BAM Management was wholly owned by BAM Management Company Limited, a Cayman Islands company, which in turn was wholly owned by CPZ Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company that was owned and controlled by Zhao.

BUSD is a Binance-branded U.S. Dollar denominated crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain. In December 2019, BAM Trading entered into a partnership with Trust Company A, whereby Trust Company A provided certain services with respect to BUSD purchases and sales on the Binance.US Platform. Effective February 21, 2023, Trust Company A ceased issuing new BUSD pursuant to an NYDFS order. Trust Company B is a Nevada-based trust company. In or around July 2019, BAM Trading entered into an agreement with Trust Company B to provide certain services to customers purchasing crypto assets on the Binance.US Platform with U.S. dollars. Sigma Chain is a crypto asset trading firm incorporated in Switzerland. Zhao is Sigma Chain’s beneficial owner, and several Binance employees conducted its operations. Among others, Binance’s back office manager (“Binance Back Office Manager”) was Sigma Chain’s President at the same time she also had signatory authority over BAM Trading’s bank accounts. Sigma Chain was an active trader on both Binance Platforms, and described itself as “the main market maker for Binance.com.” Upon the Binance.US Platform’s launch, Zhao directed that Sigma Chain be one of its first market makers. Further, since the Binance.US Platform began offering over-the-counter (“OTC”) trading and its Convert Trading and One Click Buy Sell (“OCBS”) Services to customers, Sigma Chain has served as one of the counterparties to Binance.US Platform customers, including, at times, serving as the only counterparty.

It has described itself as “a proprietary firm trading with our owner’s [Zhao’s] self-made wealth from the digital asset business.” Merit Peak was an OTC trading service provider on the Binance.com Platform and was one of the earliest market makers on the Binance.US Platform. Through Merit Peak, Zhao has also directed over $16 million to BAM Management to fund the Binance.US Platform’s operations. Below is a high-level graphical representation of a certain limited number of relationships and entities relevant to the allegations herein. The Securities Act and the Exchange Act define “security” to include a wide range of assets including “investment contracts.” Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. As the United States Supreme Court noted in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., Congress defined “security” broadly to embody a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). Courts have found a variety of novel or unique investment vehicles to be investment contracts, including those involving orange groves, animal breeding programs, cattle embryos, mobile phones, enterprises that exist only on the Internet, and crypto assets (which crypto asset market participants at times also label “cryptocurrencies”). Congress enacted the Securities Act to regulate the offer and sale of securities. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c)] require those that directly or indirectly offer and sell securities to register those offers and sales with the SEC. Registration statements provide the investing public with material, sufficient, and accurate information to make informed investment decisions, including financial and managerial information about the issuer, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities. To fulfill the purposes of the Exchange Act, Congress imposed registration and disclosure obligations on certain defined participants in the national securities markets, including but not limited to broker-dealers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. It also empowered the SEC to write rules to protect investors who use the services of those intermediaries. In the Exchange Act, Congress explained that such oversight is essential to the proper functioning of the national securities markets and the national economy: [T]ransactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are effected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto … [to] perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions. U.S.C. § 78b. Congress also determined that “[t]he prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.” 15 U.S.C. § 78q-1. In enacting registration provisions for national securities exchanges, Congress found in Section 2(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78b(3)] that: Frequently the prices of securities on such exchanges and markets are susceptible to manipulation and control, and the dissemination of such prices gives rise to excessive speculation, resulting in sudden and unreasonable fluctuations in the prices of securities which (a) cause alternately unreasonable expansion and unreasonable contraction of the volume of credit available for trade, transportation, and industry in interstate commerce, (b) hinder the proper appraisal of the value of securities and thus prevent a fair calculation of taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and (c) prevent the fair valuation of collateral for bank loans and/or obstruct the effective operation of the national banking system. Accordingly, Section 5 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78e] requires an organization, association, or group of persons that meets the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, unless otherwise exempt, to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange pursuant to Section 6 of the Exchange Act. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(1)] defines “exchange” to mean “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) [17 C.F.R. § 240.3b-16(a)] further defines certain terms in the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, including “[a]n organization, association, or group of persons,” as one that: “(1) [b]rings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) [u]ses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of a trade.” Registration of a trading platform as an “exchange” under the Exchange Act is a bedrock Congressional requirement that permits the SEC to carry out its role of oversight over the national securities markets. For example, properly registered exchanges must enact rules to govern their and their members’ behavior. Under Section 6 of the Exchange, the rules, among other things, must be “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade … and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” These rules are subject to review by the SEC under Section 19 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78s], including before an exchange can be registered and begin operating. This review process is designed to ensure that securities marketplaces operate in a manner consistent with the Exchange Act as its practices and procedures evolve over time, in part to protect investors and the integrity of securities markets that affect national commerce and the economy. Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)] generally requires brokers and dealers to register with the SEC, and a broker or dealer must also become a member of one or more “self-regulatory organizations” (“SROs”), which in turn require members to adhere to rules governing members’ activities. Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)] defines “broker” generally as “any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.” Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(5)] defines “dealer” generally as “any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise.” The regulatory regime applicable to broker-dealers is a cornerstone of the federal securities laws and provides important safeguards to investors and market participants. Registered broker-dealers are subject to comprehensive regulation and rules that include recordkeeping and reporting obligations, SEC and SRO examination, and general and specific requirements aimed at addressing certain conflicts of interest, among other things. All of these rules and regulations are critical to the soundness of the national securities markets and to protecting investors in the public markets who interact with broker-dealers. To preserve the fair and orderly markets, avoid conflicts of interests, and protect investors, Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78k(a)] prohibits broker-dealers that are members of exchanges from effecting transactions on that exchange for their accounts. Section 17A(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78q-1(b)] generally makes it unlawful “for any clearing agency, unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security.” Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(23)(A)] defines the term “clearing agency” as “any person who acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both in connection with transactions in securities or who provides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securities transactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities,” as well as “any person … who (i) acts as a custodian of securities in connection with a system for the central handling of securities whereby all securities of a particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system are treated as fungible and may be transferred, loaned, or pledged by bookkeeping entry without physical delivery of securities certificates, or (ii) otherwise permits or facilitates the settlement of securities transactions or the hypothecation or lending of securities without physical delivery of securities certificates.” Registered clearing agencies are subject to comprehensive regulation under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, providing important safeguards to investors and market participants, and to the maintenance of fair competition. These regulations and rules include recordkeeping obligations and require SEC examination. Moreover, clearing agencies properly registered under the Exchange Act must enact a set of rules to govern their and their members’ behavior, and these rules are subject to review by the SEC. In U.S. securities markets, the functions described above are typically carried out by separate legal entities that are independently registered and regulated by the SEC. Separation of these core functions aims to minimize conflicts between the interests of securities intermediaries and the investors they serve. Registration and concomitant disclosure obligations allow the SEC to oversee the business of intermediaries and their relationships with investors and to thereby protect investors from manipulation, fraud, and other abuses. Investors in securities markets do not interact directly with exchanges or clearing agencies but instead are customers of broker-dealers that effect transactions on investors’ behalf. Only broker-dealers (or natural persons associated with a broker-dealer) may become members of a national securities exchange. In addition, broker-dealers that have customers must become members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), an SRO that imposes its own rules and oversight over broker-dealers, particularly as to protecting retail investors. Registered national securities exchanges and clearing agencies are also SROs and therefore must submit all of their proposed rules and rules changes to the SEC for review. As noted, the Exchange Act also subjects registered intermediaries to important record-keeping and inspection requirements. For example, Section 17 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78q] requires registered national securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies to make and keep records as the SEC prescribes by rule and subjects those records to reasonable periodic, special, or other examinations by representatives of the SEC. These provisions are designed to ensure that intermediaries follow the rules that protect investors and promote the fair and efficient operation of the securities markets. These provisions also seek to ensure, among other things, that investors’ securities orders are handled fairly and transparently, that securities transactions result in settlement finality, and that investors’ assets are protected and can be recovered if necessary. As used herein, the terms “crypto asset,” “digital asset,” or “token” generally refer to an asset issued and/or transferred using blockchain or distributed ledger technology, including assets referred to colloquially as “cryptocurrencies,” “virtual currencies,” and digital “coins.” A blockchain or distributed ledger is a database spread across a network of computers that records transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages, referred to as “blocks.” These systems typically rely on cryptographic techniques to secure recording of transactions. Some crypto assets may be “native tokens” to a particular blockchain—meaning that they are represented on their own blockchain—though other crypto assets may also be represented on that same blockchain. Crypto asset owners typically store the software providing them control over their crypto assets on a piece of hardware or software called a “crypto wallet.” Crypto wallets offer a method to store and manage critical information about crypto assets, i.e., cryptographic information necessary to identify and transfer those assets. The primary purpose of a crypto wallet is to store the “public key” and the “private key” associated with a crypto asset so that the user can make transactions on the associated blockchain. The public key is colloquially known as the user’s blockchain “address” and can be freely shared with others. The private key is analogous to a password and confers the ability to transfer a crypto asset. Whoever controls the private key controls the crypto asset associated with that key. Crypto wallets can reside on devices that are connected to the internet (sometimes called a “hot wallet”), or on devices that are not connected to the internet (sometimes called a “cold wallet” or “cold storage”)."

      "summary": "Danaher is a conglomerate which owns various operating companies that design, manufacture, and market professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services worldwide. The Company is comprised of more than 17 operating companies organized under three reporting segments: Biotechnology; Life Sciences; and Diagnostics. In 2020 and 2021, Danaher’s diagnostic tests and life sciences equipment were widely used in the effort to combat COVID-19. Specifically, Danaher’s diagnostics segment included Cepheid, a leader in molecular testing, and its life sciences segment included several companies that provided products and services, including sophisticated lab-grade equipment, used by customers to develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. As a result, Danaher experienced explosive revenue growth during this period, and its stock price nearly tripled, reaching an all-time high of $332.43 per share on September 3, 2021. By the beginning of 2022 it was apparent to Danaher as well as the broader financial community that COVID-19, which helped propel the Company to new heights, would soon turn endemic and demand for COVID-related products would dissipate. Investors, like Plaintiffs, were keen to understand the health of Danaher’s business without the amplification provided by the COVID-19 pandemic, including, in particular, the arm responsible for manufactured equipment and components used by biopharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and other therapeutics, known as the “bioprocessing” branch of Danaher’s Life Sciences reporting segment. By the start of 2022, this single business division had grown to become a $7.5 billion franchise. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants declared that there would be enduring demand for products supporting the development of treatments for COVID-19, and the bioprocessing business’ far larger non-COVID product offerings provided a robust runway for long-term growth. They reasoned that the business was healthy by citing increasing sales, dismissed concerns expressed by analysts about shifting market dynamics, and issued ambitious forecasts for the business, which projected the image of sustained growth in both 2022 and 2023. Behind the scenes, the bioprocessing business was unraveling and Defendants knew it. Among other things, customers in the biopharmaceutical industry began to temper their pursuit of COVID-related projects as the population at large began to accept COVID-19 as an endemic disease. In addition, large pharmaceutical customers continued to receive equipment in response to orders placed months earlier during the peak of the pandemic due to the extensive lead times caused by the global supply chain disruption. But having just emerged from a supply crisis, these customers decided to stockpile this inventory rather than cancel the orders in order to put the equipment toward other projects and, effectively, prevent the need to place orders in the future. In addition, smaller startups in early-stage development which traditionally relied on external sources to fund their projects no longer had the same access to funding that they did during the pandemic as interest rates rose, and began to prioritize projects in order to conserve cash. Together, these developments had a catastrophic impact on the bioprocessing business, particularly as they sustained through 2022 and 2023. Unfortunately, investors like Plaintiffs, did not find out until it was too late. Rather than admit that there was a sales cliff looming for the bioprocessing business, Defendants made piecemeal revisions to their public forecasts over the Class Period, ultimately reducing the projections from impressive year-on-year growth to year-over-year declines across the board. Each of these announcements was followed by a significant stock drop as the truth leaked out. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiffs and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Plaintiffs allege that Focus Financial Partners, Inc.'s Board of Directors and its officers breached their fiduciary duties in connection with a sale process that resulted in the take-private acquisition of Focus by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) in August 2023 (the “Merger”). Plaintiffs allege that Focus and its directors and officers made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about the sale process in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The sale process began in the summer of 2022. The Board was allegedly motivated by the interests of Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), Focus's single largest and most influential shareholder. Stone Point owned approximately 20.6% of Focus's equity and voting power, had placed two of its senior employees on Focus's eight-member Board, and possessed multiple additional contractual levers of influence that augmented its ability to control the Company. Stone Point wanted to liquidate part of its investment in Focus through a sale of the Company. Its incentive to do so was compounded by its interests under Tax Receivable Agreements (“TRAs”), pursuant to which Stone Point stood to receive a lump sum windfall of approximately $90 million in the event of a sale. Stone Point also wanted to roll over part of its investment in Focus and obtain the right to invest fresh equity capital into the post-sale company. Stone Point was, accordingly, only interested in a sale to a financial buyer. CD&R, a prototypical financial buyer, quickly expressed interest in a deal. It also made clear both that it wanted Stone Point to remain an investor in Focus post-sale and that it wanted to maintain Focus's existing executive management team. Focus thereafter homed in on a deal with CD&R and embarked on months of exclusive negotiations with CD&R while continuing to forgo any outreach to potential strategic acquirors. Ultimately, Focus's Board approved the Merger with CD&R for $53 per share. The Board and Officer Defendants are alleged to have breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the sale process leading to the Merger. The Board Defendants include Adolf (CEO), Kodialam (COO), Carey (President of Stone Point), and Muhtadie (Co-Head of Private Equity at Stone Point). The Officer Defendants include Shanahan (CFO), Chang (Senior Managing Director and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions), and McGranahan (General Counsel and Corporate Secretary). The Special Committee Defendants include LeMieux (Chairman of the Special Committee), Neuhoff, Morganroth, and Feliciani. The Special Committee Defendants were not members of management or affiliated with Stone Point. Plaintiffs' claims are brought on behalf of a putative class of Focus shareholders who held Focus common stock as of the record date for the Merger and were entitled to vote on the Merger. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by (1) conducting a self-interested sale process that was designed to benefit insiders but failed to maximize value for public shareholders and (2) making false and misleading statements and omissions in the Proxy Statement filed to solicit a shareholder vote on the Merger. The sale process began in the summer of 2022 when the Board determined to explore strategic alternatives for the Company. Plaintiffs allege that the timing of the process was suspect because Focus was operating from a position of strength as a standalone company. Goldman Sachs, the Board's financial advisor, informed the Board that it was a challenging market to execute a deal, but the Board nevertheless undertook a sale process. Plaintiffs allege that the sale process was motivated by Stone Point's interests. Stone Point had several levers of influence over the Company, including its ownership of approximately 20.6% of Focus's shareholder equity and voting power. Stone Point also had the power to nominate two directors to the Board, and it exercised this right to place Carey and Muhtadie—two of Stone Point's Managing Directors—on Focus's eight-member Board. Stone Point also had the right to designate two of the three members of the Board's Compensation Committee, which was responsible for making all significant decisions concerning compensation of Focus's senior executives. This gave Stone Point de facto control over the Board and the Company's executive management team. Stone Point also exercised a significant amount of power in the context of negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition through Focus's First Lien Credit Agreement (the “Credit Document”). The Credit Document provided that a “Change of Control” could trigger an “Event of Default” requiring the acceleration and repayment of Focus's debt. The definition of “Change of Control” excluded “Permitted Holders” from those acquirors that would cause a change of control and trigger the acceleration provision. Permitted Holders included Stone Point and members of Focus's management team. The definition also carved out situations where the “Permitted Holders have, at such time, the right or the ability by voting power, contract, or otherwise to elect or designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors of the Borrower.” The effect of this arrangement was to grant Stone Point a tremendous amount of power in negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition. If Stone Point and management did not agree to roll over equity into the surviving company, or if an acquiror did not grant Stone Point and management the right to elect a majority of the Board, then Focus's debt would accelerate under the Credit Document. The acceleration of debt would require the acquiror to find a new source of debt at higher interest rates, increasing the cost of the acquisition for that acquiror. In theory, Stone Point should have been willing to partner with whichever counterparty offered the best deal for shareholders. But, from the outset, Stone Point acted instead to advance its own interests. Stone Point was only interested in a sale to a financial buyer. Strategic buyers would likely be willing to pay shareholders more money per share in order to capture the value of synergies, but would be much less likely to allow Stone Point to maintain an equity interest post-sale. CD&R, a private equity firm, quickly expressed interest in a deal. It also made clear both that it wanted Stone Point to remain an investor in Focus post-sale and that it wanted to maintain Focus's existing executive management team. Focus thereafter homed in on a deal with CD&R and embarked on months of exclusive negotiations with CD&R while continuing to forgo any outreach to potential strategic acquirors. In September 2022, while Focus was still in the early stages of its negotiations with CD&R, CEO contacted Focus's CEO Rudy Adolf about a potential deal. CEO then met with Adolf in November 2022 to discuss his interest in a “transformative transaction” between the two companies. Adolf, however, acted to keep at arm's-length. It was not until late December 2022 that was finally invited to make a proposal. By then, Focus had been engaged in effectively exclusive deal negotiations with CD&R for five months, giving CD&R a substantial informational advantage over and other potential bidders. nevertheless quickly proposed to purchase Focus for $55 per share. Despite its plainly superior proposal, the Special Committee followed Adolf in deterring . It refused to provide with access to requested diligence or grant it exclusivity, even though the Special Committee had acquiesced to CD&R's identical demands based on its lower-priced proposal of $53 per share. Instead, the Special Committee finalized the deal with CD&R. The Special Committee—comprised of the members of the Board who were not members of management or affiliated with Stone Point—was itself conflicted. Its members had personal relationships with Adolf as well as significant financial incentives to go along with Stone Point and management to get a deal done. Through a combination of payments pursuant to the Company's TRAs, accelerated unvested units in the Company, and fees for serving on the Special Committee (which the Committee and Board voted to substantially increase immediately before the Committee approved the Merger), each member of the Committee stood to receive a significant financial payment as a result of the Merger. These payments were different from the Merger Consideration received by public shareholders. The Special Committee members' conflicts were not disclosed in the Proxy, which instead touted their purported independence. Defendants' conflicts of interest were compounded, moreover, by significant conflicts also harbored by the two financial advisors that assisted in connection with the process leading to the Merger. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”), which initiated the process and helped channel it towards financial buyers, was conflicted by extensive and longstanding business ties to Stone Point and CD&R. To make matters worse, Goldman Sachs was also running a contemporaneous competing sale process for a Focus subsidiary, NKSFB, LLC (“NKSFB”), and its management company KSFB Management, LLC (“KSFB”). As a result, Goldman Sachs limited the pool of potential Focus acquirors during the majority of Focus's sale process to bidders that were not involved in the NKSFB sale process. Goldman Sachs only contacted those bidders after the NKSFB sale collapsed and after a Merger Agreement with CD&R was already executed. This dynamic was not disclosed in the Proxy. Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), which was brought in late to “chaperone” Goldman Sachs in recognition of its conflicts of interest, was incentivized to render a positive assessment of the deal by a massive, last-minute increase in its own fee. This too was not disclosed in the Proxy. Ultimately, effectively every actor involved in the Focus sale process that was supposed to be working on behalf of Focus shareholders was badly conflicted. This led to an utterly deficient process in which Focus failed to adequately canvass the market and tilted the playing field in favor of CD&R, culminating in the stiff-arming of a potential buyer willing to pay shareholders significantly greater consideration than CD&R. Defendants acted to conceal all of these facts by issuing public disclosures that consistently omitted or shaded the truth. Instead, Defendants touted a counterfactual narrative in which the sale process was thorough and reliable, there were no significant conflicts of interest, and CD&R's underpriced $53 per share proposal offered shareholders “the best value reasonably obtainable.” Based on these materially false and misleading statements, Focus shareholders approved the Merger and accepted the Merger Consideration. Through this Action, Lead Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants liable for their misrepresentations and recover damages for the harm shareholders incurred as a result thereof. The claims asserted herein arise under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) are brought on behalf of a class (the “Class”) consisting of Lead Plaintiffs and all other persons or entities, excluding Defendants (defined more fully below), that sold shares of Focus Financial common stock from February 27, 2023, the announcement date of the Merger, through the close of the Merger on August 31, 2023 (the “Class Period”), including investors that sold their shares of Focus Financial common stock into the Merger and were damaged thereby. The claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, are brought on behalf of Lead Plaintiffs and other Focus shareholders as of the June 9, 2023 record date (the “Record Date”) that were entitled to vote on the “take-private” acquisition by CD&R. Focus was founded in 2004 by Defendants Adolf, Kodialam and Chang. It went public through an initial public offering completed on July 26, 2018. Thereafter, shares of the Company's Class A common stock traded publicly on the NASDAQ market until the August 2023 closing of the Merger. Upon the closing the Merger, public shareholders were cashed out and Focus became a privately held company whose shares are predominantly owned by CD&R. The Company operates in the RIA space, with ownership interests in more than 85 independent wealth management firms that provide investment and financial services to high and ultra-high net worth individuals and families. Most of its partner firms are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The sale process leading to the Merger commenced in the summer of 2022, when Focus's Board determined to explore available strategic options, including a potential sale. At all relevant times, however, the sale process was plagued by conflicts of interest harbored by Stone Point (which was the Company's largest shareholder and controlled at least half the Board), the Company's executive management team, and the members of the Company's Board—including the members of a purportedly-independent Special Committee ultimately appointed to oversee the Merger process. These insider conflicts of interest were, moreover, compounded by serious conflicts of interest harbored by the financial advisors engaged to assist with the process, who were more concerned with their own financial interests than with ensuring that any sale appropriately maximized value for Focus shareholders. The conflicts produced an utterly deficient sale process that benefited insiders but was inconsistent with maximizing value for Focus's public shareholders. As an initial matter, the timing of the process was suspect. Focus was operating from a position of strength as a standalone company and experiencing significant ongoing growth. It had no immediate need to explore a sale. As shown in the chart below, its revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) were impressive, with each metric more than doubling from the time of the Company's 2018 IPO to 2022: that Focus's breakup value was approximately $10 billion—a greater than 42% premium over the $7 billion valuation on which the Merger (announced just weeks later) would be premised. Indeed, at the outset of the process that would ultimately culminate in the Merger, Focus was specifically advised that it was not an ideal time for a sale. In a presentation to the Board delivered June 30, 2022, Goldman Sachs specifically informed the Board that it was then a “challenging market to execute a deal,” that there was “limited upside in engaging at this point,” and that Focus's “stock/valuation remains under pressure.” Goldman Sachs further advised that signing a nondisclosure agreement (“NDA”) with a potential bidder “may create noise in market,” and that, in this “challenging financing market; why share info now; can engage later.” Ignoring this advice, the Board nevertheless undertook a process to sell Focus, resulting in a deal price that failed to maximize value for its public shareholders. The decision to commence a sale process in the bear market of Summer 2022 was not motivated by any business need or by the availability of any particularly attractive opportunity. Indeed, from the perspective of Focus's public shareholders, it would have made sense to heed Goldman Sachs' advice and continue operating the Company as a successful standalone enterprise. But Stone Point had other interests, including a short-term desire to return cash to its investors. As a private equity firm, Stone Point's business model is to acquire an ownership stake in financial services businesses, operate those businesses alongside their existing management teams for five to ten years, then exit its investments at a premium and return cash proceeds to its investors. Stone Point originally invested in Focus in April 2017 and, by the Summer of 2022, it was looking for a way to liquidate at least part of its investment in the Company to return capital. It was Stone Point's interests that drove the timing, and ultimately the terms, of the Company's sale. Stone Point enjoyed several levers of influence that allowed it to drive the Company's sale process. At the time of the Merger, Stone Point owned approximately 20.6% of Focus's shareholder equity and voting power, making it the Company's single largest shareholder and enabling it to exercise significant control over the direction of the Company. Pursuant to a Nominating Agreement executed in connection with the Company's IPO, moreover, Stone Point enjoyed additional levers of influence that augmented its control over Focus. First, the Nominating Agreement empowered Stone Point to nominate two directors to the Board. Stone Point exercised this right to place Defendants Carey and Muhtadie—two of Stone Point's Managing Directors—on Focus's eight-member Board. Defendant Muhtadie was appointed as the purported “lead independent director” at Focus. Second, the Nominating Agreement also empowered Stone Point to designate two of the three members of the Board's Compensation Committee. Defendants Carey and Muhtadie were designated members of, and constituted two-thirds of, the Committee (with Defendant LeMieux serving as the third member). This gave Stone Point de facto control over all significant decisions concerning compensation of Focus's senior executives and, therefore, gave Stone Point an extremely potent lever of influence over the members of the Company's executive management team. As Focus acknowledged in its April 14, 2022 annual proxy statement, the “Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation and employee benefit programs, and reviews and approves all compensation decisions relating to our NEOs [Named Executive Officers].” The Compensation Committee also, moreover, “approve[d] the amount of [Focus's] annual incentive cash pool, and any and all awards to [the Company's] NEOs from this pool.” Stone Point, therefore, had the power to control the compensation of Focus's senior executives. Those executives included Focus's CEO and COO, Adolf and Kodialam, both of whom were also members of the Board. This arrangement gave Stone Point significant control over those individuals and, combined with its own two Managing Directors serving on the Board, gave Stone Point direct control over at least four of the eight members of the Board at the time of Focus's sale process and resulting Merger. As yet another lever of influence, Stone Point exercised a significant amount of power in the context of negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition through Focus's First Lien Credit Agreement (the “Credit Document”), which the Company entered prior to its IPO. Section 11.11 of the Credit Document provided that a “Change of Control,” in which a third party acquired 35% or more of Focus's voting stock, could trigger an “Event of Default” requiring the acceleration and repayment of Focus's debt. In defining “Change of Control,” the Credit Document excluded “Permitted Holders” from those acquirors that would cause a change of control and trigger the acceleration provision. Permitted Holders included Stone Point and members of Focus's management team. The definition also carved out situations where the “Permitted Holders have, at such time, the right or the ability by voting power, contract, or otherwise to elect or designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors of the Borrower.” The effect of this arrangement was to grant Stone Point a tremendous amount of power in negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition. If Stone Point and management did not agree to roll over equity into the surviving company, or if an acquiror did not grant Stone Point and management the right to elect a majority of the Board, then Focus's debt would accelerate under the Credit Document. The acceleration of debt would require the acquiror to find a new source of debt at higher interest rates, increasing the cost of the acquisition for that acquiror. The Proxy does not quantify these costs, but documents produced by the Company indicate that, if the debt was not “portable,” an acquiror would be faced with additional costs of $3.00–$4.00 per share to acquire new debt, based on the deteriorating state of the credit markets at the time. The Proxy also does not disclose that, in order to preserve the Credit Document and avoid acceleration of Focus's debt, Stone Point would be allowed to control the Board following the Merger. In short, based on its powers under the Credit Document, Stone Point and management could control the sale process, as they would need to agree on the counterparty and participate as an owner of the surviving company—and maintain board control—to ensure the portability of the Company's debt, lowering costs for"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Walmart is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of retail stores, including hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. Walmart is the largest operator of discount retail stores in the United States, with approximately 5,000 pharmacies in its Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. Walmart’s pharmacy business earned $21.1 billion in prescription drug dispensing revenue in 2019, making it the fifth largest pharmacy chain in the United States by that metric. Defendant Douglas C. McMillon (“McMillon”) has been Walmart’s President and CEO since February 2014 and a Company director since 2013. McMillon is the Chair of the Executive Committee (which he joined in November 2013) and a member of the Ethics, Compliance, and Risk Committee. Defendant M. Brett Biggs (“Biggs”) has been Walmart’s Executive Vice President and CFO since January 2016. He is also a member of the Ethics, Compliance, and Risk Committee. The plaintiffs are Kim Kengle as trustee of the Kim K. Kengle 2000 Trust and Roseanne Lacy. Kengle purchased shares of Walmart common stock during the Class Period and was damaged thereby. Lacy purchased shares of Walmart common stock during the Class Period and was damaged thereby. Kengle and Lacy bring this securities class action on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Walmart publicly traded common stock between March 31, 2017, and December 22, 2020, inclusive, (the “Class Period”) and who held such shares on March 24, 2020, and/or December 22, 2020, and suffered compensable damages thereby (the “Class”). The plaintiffs allege that Walmart violated the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) for over a decade and concealed from investors the government’s intensifying criminal and civil investigations into Walmart’s legal violations. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart’s internal documents prior to the Class Period acknowledge that Walmart failed to comply with a secret 2011 settlement with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and did not have a system to monitor suspicious orders of opioids. The plaintiffs also allege that as early as June 2014, Walmart acknowledged that it was “likely” that the company would therefore face “severe financial and reputational harm.” The plaintiffs allege that in May 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas (“EDTX DOJ”) told Walmart that an indictment of the company was imminent. The plaintiffs allege that while the EDTX DOJ began its criminal investigation into Walmart in 2016, it was not until March 2020 that investors would learn that Walmart had been on the brink of indictment and that while Walmart had seemingly escaped criminal prosecution, it was still the subject of a DOJ civil investigation related to Walmart’s dispensing and distributing opioids. The plaintiffs allege that in December 2020, the DOJ filed an enforcement action against Walmart, laying bare the company’s brazen misconduct and utter disregard of well-established legal requirements under the CSA. The plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period, Walmart made false and misleading statements that concealed the government investigations and the risks related to the company’s failure to comply with the CSA. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart violated SEC regulations and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that required the company to disclose the government investigations and the risks related to the company’s opioid dispensing and distribution business. The plaintiffs allege that they affirmatively represented in Walmart’s Class Period SEC filings that it had disclosed all reasonably possible liabilities that may be material even though Walmart never specifically disclosed the government investigations. The plaintiffs allege that in Walmart’s Class Period SEC filings, they set forth boilerplate risks related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired related to Walmart’s pharmacy business. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart engaged in a PR campaign characterizing Walmart as a “steward” in combatting the opioid crisis. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart’s failure to comply with the CSA prompted the DEA to take nationwide action against it in 2009. The plaintiffs allege that in November 2009, the DEA issued an Order to Show Cause seeking to revoke the registration of a Walmart in California to dispense controlled substances. The plaintiffs allege that to resolve the enforcement proceeding stemming from the 2009 Order to Show Cause, and “avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation,” Walmart and the DEA entered into a nationwide memorandum of agreement in 2011 (“2011 MOA”). The plaintiffs allege that the 2011 MOA was for a four-year term, was national in scope, and required Walmart to implement a variety of compliance measures within no later than four years and maintain a robust compliance program to ensure compliance with the CSA. The plaintiffs allege that the 2011 MOA essentially put Walmart on probation. The plaintiffs allege that despite this, Walmart egregiously violated the 2011 MOA. The plaintiffs allege that in 2014, Walmart’s corporate compliance department internally acknowledged, in a corporate governance “worksheet,” of which Walmart’s board of directors was informed, that Walmart had “no processes in place” to comply with its legal requirements to have a functioning suspicious order monitoring system pursuant to the 2011 MOA and the CSA. The plaintiffs allege that the company further recognized that because of its CSA violations, Walmart was “likely” to experience “severe financial and reputational impact.” The plaintiffs allege that in 2015, Walmart internally acknowledged that its suspicious order monitoring system required “immediate and substantial enhancements” to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of non-compliance with the CSA.” The plaintiffs allege that the criminal investigation came after the DEA raided one of Walmart’s stores—a rare occurrence for a Fortune 500 company. The plaintiffs allege that the criminal investigation uncovered Walmart’s systematic CSA violations. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart pharmacists from all over the country told the company that they did not want to fill prescriptions of opioids because they were from doctors running pill mills. The plaintiffs allege that customers in Texas had died after taking suspect prescriptions that Walmart filled. The plaintiffs allege that pharmacists pleaded with Walmart’s corporate office. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart refused to take corporate-wide action. The plaintiffs allege that instead, it provided bonuses to pharmacists based on the number of prescriptions filled and pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions as quickly as possible. The plaintiffs allege that on March 28, 2018, U.S. attorneys at EDTX DOJ informed Walmart that it was going to indict the company. The plaintiffs allege that in May 2018, EDTX DOJ told Walmart that the indictment was imminent and that the company should pay $1 billion to settle the civil charges. The plaintiffs allege that in the months that followed, Walmart’s top lawyers met with EDTX prosecutors. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart’s lawyers consulted Defendant McMillon, who approved the company’s presentation to the DOJ wherein it attempted to convince the DOJ not to indict Walmart. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart’s top outside counsel at Jones Day highlighted the damage an indictment would cause to Walmart and its shareholders, describing the “profound negative impact on the lives and families of the company’s 1.5 million U.S. employees and its innocent shareholders. The decision to indict Walmart could ultimately result in layoffs. It would also likely mean the loss of billions of dollars in the value of Walmart shares held in retirement saving accounts for millions of Americans and the pension funds of countless nonprofits and public employees.” The plaintiffs allege that the U.S. Attorneys working on the criminal investigation characterized Walmart’s pleas as no different than that of a criminal defendant who pleads for leniency stating his children will be harmed by his incarceration. The plaintiffs allege that they stated that Walmart’s size did not make it above prosecution. The plaintiffs allege that according to federal prosecutors working on the case, Walmart exploited its access to high-level DOJ officials by lobbying to quash the contemplated criminal indictment. The plaintiffs allege that around the same time, Walmart hired Rachel Brand, a DOJ official in Washington DC, to further influence the DOJ. The plaintiffs allege that shortly thereafter, DOJ leadership instructed the U.S. Attorney for EDTX to drop the criminal indictment. The plaintiffs allege that notwithstanding the declination, of which Walmart was informed on August 31, 2018, the civil investigation against the company continued. The plaintiffs allege that according to prosecutors, Walmart did not cooperate with the investigation. The plaintiffs allege that for example, Walmart never gave prosecutors a full list of doctors that pharmacists were concerned about; Walmart did not give prosecutors full information on its internal databases to analyze prescribing information and patterns; and most importantly, Walmart refused to produce emails between compliance officials and the company’s senior management. The plaintiffs allege that they concealed from investors the existence of the government investigations, as well as the 2009 Order to Show Cause and 2011 MOA. The plaintiffs allege that on March 25, 2020, before the market opened, ProPublica published a 7,500-word exposé disclosing for the first time that the EDTX DOJ had been criminally investigating Walmart for violating the CSA and related laws since 2016. The plaintiffs allege that the article revealed that in March 2018, they became aware that EDTX DOJ intended to indict the company and that even after the DOJ declined to indict the company, it remained the subject of an ongoing DOJ civil investigation. The plaintiffs allege that the article also revealed that Walmart entered a secret settlement with the DEA in 2011 in which it agreed to implement measures to comply with the CSA, and that Walmart had received more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA from 2000 to 2018 for its opioid prescribing practices. The plaintiffs allege that the article further revealed that Walmart did not comply with the 2011 MOA, prompting the EDTX DOJ to pursue criminal charges against the company. The plaintiffs allege that the article noted that it was “troubling to the federal investigators” that Walmart violated the CSA from 2011 to 2016, despite the fact that “for much of this period, Walmart was operating under a secret settlement…with the DEA.” The plaintiffs allege that “[p]rosecutors believed that Walmart was not fulfilling the terms of its agreement with the DEA.” The plaintiffs allege that on this news, shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share from its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020, to its close at $109.40 on March 25, 2020, damaging investors. The plaintiffs allege that on December 22, 2020, the DOJ announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Walmart for alleged violations of the CSA. The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ’s complaint alleges that from June 26, 2013, onward, Walmart “knowingly filled thousands of controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical purposes or in the usual course of medical practice, and that it filled prescriptions outside the ordinary course of pharmacy practice.” The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ complaint also alleged that, “as the operator of its distribution centers, which ceased distributing controlled substances in 2018, Walmart received hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders that it failed to report as required to by the DEA.” The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ stated that “these actions helped to fuel the prescription opioid crisis.” The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ’s press release stated that it sought civil penalties which “could total in billions” and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs allege that on this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%, over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020, damaging investors. The plaintiffs allege that despite their awareness of: (1) the 2011 MOA, (2) Walmart’s CSA violations, (3) the EDTX DOJ’s criminal investigation and intent to indict the company, (4) the civil investigation and (5) Walmart’s own acknowledgment that it was likely the company would face severe financial and reputational damage based on its CSA violations and failure to comply with the 2011 MOA, they: 1) Misrepresented that they had disclosed all legal proceedings where a liability is “reasonably possible” and “may be material,” despite having never disclosed the government investigations (or the 2011 MOA); 2) violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles governing the disclosure of contingent liabilities by failing to disclose the government investigations as a contingent liability in Walmart’s Class Period financial statements despite being aware that it was at least reasonably possible (GAAP’s threshold requiring disclosure) that Walmart would incur a material liability as a result of the government investigations; 3) violated Item 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.30 (“Item 103”) which requires disclosure of material legal proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, by failing to disclose the government investigations; 4) set forth boilerplate risk disclosures related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired while concealing the government investigations; and 5) falsely portrayed Walmart as a “steward” in the opioid crisis with “comprehensive policies and training to help support its pharmacists in filling prescriptions only for legitimate medical reasons” when in truth Walmart’s policies were specifically designed to prevent pharmacists from refusing to fill illegitimate prescriptions. The plaintiffs allege that additionally, McMillon and Biggs issued false and misleading Sarbanes Oxley certifications attesting to the accuracy of the company’s financial statements and statements in the company’s quarterly and annual reports, despite the violations of GAAP and SEC regulations and false statements described above. The plaintiffs allege that as a result of their wrongful acts and omissions, and the decline in the market value of the company’s securities following a series of corrective disclosures, they and other Class members suffered significant damages. The plaintiffs allege that Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Pub. L. No. 91-513, tit. II, 84 Stat. 1236, 1242-84 (1970) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-904), in 1970 to, among other things, “provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels.” The plaintiffs allege that the CSA creates a category of drugs, known as “controlled substances,” that are subject to strict federal monitoring based on their potential for abuse. The plaintiffs allege that the CSA comprehensively regulates every participant in the supply chain for controlled substances, from manufacturers to wholesale distributors to retail pharmacies. The plaintiffs allege that because controlled substances, by definition, are drugs with the potential for abuse, this comprehensive scheme is designed to prevent the “diversion”—i.e., the illegal misuse—of controlled substances, including prescription opioids. The plaintiffs allege that under the CSA, every participant in the supply chain bears responsibility for preventing the misuse of controlled substances. The plaintiffs allege that controlled substances are grouped into five categories. The plaintiffs allege that Schedule II controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, which, if abused, “may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.” The plaintiffs allege that despite this, they have “a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.” The plaintiffs allege that Schedule II includes opioid-based painkillers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, and stimulants such as amphetamine. The plaintiffs allege that any person who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance must register, and maintain registration, with the DEA. The plaintiffs allege that the CSA requires distributors of controlled substances to “design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances,” and “shall inform” DEA of those suspicious orders “when discovered.” The plaintiffs allege that thus, a distributor must itself detect and identify suspicious orders and report them to DEA. The plaintiffs allege that this requirement protects against diversion and abuse by requiring distributors to monitor pharmacies for warning signs of such misconduct. The plaintiffs allege that suspicious orders “include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.” The plaintiffs allege that in other words, orders that are unusual in one or more of those three ways—size, pattern, or frequency—are deemed “suspicious orders,” and a distributor must detect and report them. The plaintiffs allege that the regulation does not limit “suspicious orders” to those three categories, however. The plaintiffs allege that it states, non-exclusively, that suspicious orders “include” those categories. The plaintiffs allege that because Walmart acted as its own distributor for controlled substances (up until November 2017), it had a special advantage: Walmart had access to extensive data and other information that gave it the ability—had it wanted to—to investigate the circumstances underlying orders for controlled substances. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart was subject to numerous requirements under the CSA as a pharmacy dispensing controlled substances. The plaintiffs allege that these requirements are specifically enumerated in the DOJ Complaint. The plaintiffs allege that a registrant who dispenses a drug issued without a valid prescription may be subject to civil penalties or, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties. The plaintiffs allege that the CSA also authorizes the Attorney General to seek declaratory and injunctive relief for such violations of law. The plaintiffs allege that Part 1306 of the CSA has three rules that pharmacists must follow. The plaintiffs allege that a pharmacist must first determine that the prescription was issued by a licensed medical practitioner in the usual course of their practice; the pharmacist must next determine that the prescription is for a legitimate medical purpose; and finally, the pharmacist must adhere to the usual course of their own practice in filling the prescription. The plaintiffs allege that Walmart, as a pharmacy, was bound by these rules. The plaintiffs allege that pharmacists are not permitted under law to rely exclusively on the fact that a prescription was issued by a licensed medical professional in determining whether a prescription is valid. The plaintiffs allege that pharmacists are instead required to consider “red flags” when they appear and when their appearance brings into question the validity of a prescription which a medical professional has issued. The plaintiffs allege that such “red flags” include, but are not limited to, a medical professional who issues large quantities of controlled substances—for example, a doctor who issues prescriptions for opioids in large quantities to large numbers of patients; prescriptions which are themselves dangerous—for example, certain combinations of drugs which are known to be susceptible to abuse and/or dangerous in combination; and the circumstances of the patient themselves—for example, a customer who the pharmacist knows always refills their large opioid prescriptions well before the individual should have used up the previous supply of pills from an earlier prescription. The plaintiffs allege that if the pharmacist cannot resolve the red flag, the pharmacist must refuse to fill the prescription. The plaintiffs allege that if the pharmacist can resolve the red flag, the pharmacist must document its resolution. The plaintiffs allege that a lack of documentation is evidence that the pharmacist did not resolve the red flag. The plaintiffs allege that violations of the CSA’s dispensing rules are subject to civil penalties not to exceed $25,000 for each violation on or before November 2, 2015, and not to exceed $67,627 for each violation after November 2, 2015. The plaintiffs allege that distributors of controlled substances are also required to abide by certain legal obligations when they receive controlled substance orders from pharmacies. The plaintiffs allege that distributors are required to register with the DEA and maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances. The plaintiffs allege that a distributor is required to design"

      "summary": "The Court draws the following facts from the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 23.) The Plaintiffs are all individuals who invested with CFT Solutions, LLC (“CFT”) and FxWinning Limited (“FxWinning”) (collectively, the “Companies”). (Id. ¶¶ 7–26.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Companies and the Individual Defendants converted tens of millions of dollars belonging to the Plaintiffs for the Defendants’ benefit. (Id. ¶ 1.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants represented to them that Defendant David Merino had invented an algorithm that would allow clients such as the Plaintiffs to receive high returns on forex trading, which would be collectively run by CFT and its broker, FxWinning. (Id. ¶ 2.) The Defendants pitched the Companies as providing not just high returns, but also guaranteed the security of the Plaintiffs’ funds. (Id.) The Plaintiffs allege that while the Defendants initially permitted several withdrawals by the Plaintiffs from their accounts through December 2022, the Defendants discontinued all withdrawals in early 2023 under the guise of instituting new security-guided procedures to comply with requirements of its liquidity provider, i.e., new Know Your Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) procedures. (Id.) Even after purportedly establishing the KYC and AML procedures and expressly informing the Plaintiffs in May and June 2023 that their KYC and AML updates were “successfully completed” and that the Plaintiffs would have their funds within fifteen working days, the Defendants have still failed to release a single dollar. (Id. ¶ 3.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have wrongfully held and continue to withhold more than $27,000,000.00 belonging to the Plaintiffs. (Id.) The Plaintiffs claim that they invested millions of dollars with CFT and FxWinning based on the Defendants’ representations of a high-frequency trading system and unique algorithm. (Id. ¶ 120.) The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants promoted, solicited, or sold the accounts, i.e., the investments in the Defendants’ platform(s) and software, to the Plaintiffs. (Id. ¶ 130.) The Plaintiffs claim that no registration statements have been filed with the SEC or have been in effect with respect to Defendants’ platform(s) and software. (Id.) The Plaintiffs further claim that the Defendants employed devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; made untrue statements of material fact; and engaged in acts, practices, and a course of business that operated as a fraud and deceit upon the Plaintiffs in violation of § 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. (Id. ¶ 134.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants knew that they in fact did not intend to honor the terms of Plaintiffs’ investments and that the statements that the Defendants made to solicit the Plaintiffs’ funds regarding the platform(s) and software were materially false and misleading. (Id. ¶ 136.) The Plaintiffs further allege that the Defendants each made false statements, used a false scheme, and/or intended to and thereafter did cheat the Plaintiffs in connection with contracts for the sale of a commodity or a commodity pool, in violation of Sections 6b, 6e, and 6o of the Commodity Exchange Act. (Id. ¶ 145.) The Plaintiffs allege that the investments they made were “securities” as defined by the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act, Section 517.301, Florida Statutes, et seq. (the “Florida Act”). (Id. ¶ 148.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants violated the Florida Act by, among other things: (i) employing a device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (ii) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts that would render the statements misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are made; (iii) engaging in an act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a person; and (iv) knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up, by any trick, scheme, or device, a material fact, making any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document, knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry. (Id. ¶ 149.) The Plaintiffs allege that they and FxWinning entered into an agreement governing the Plaintiffs’ investments in their accounts with FxWinning. (Id. ¶ 156.) The Plaintiffs allege that the terms of the investment agreement are reflected in FxWinning’s terms and conditions, which include the customer agreement. (Id.) The Plaintiffs allege that FxWinning has committed material breaches of the terms and conditions by, among other actions, prohibiting withdrawal of Plaintiffs’ funds despite multiple requests. (Id. ¶ 159.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs including, without limitation, duties of good faith and care with regard to the Plaintiffs’ funds and that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs. (Id. ¶¶ 163–64.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants represented to them, among other things, that CFT and FxWinning were partners, that investing money with FxWinning was the exclusive means by which to gain access to CFT’s trading platform, that CFT and FxWinning were operating successful companies, that the Defendants would use investment funds to engage in forex trading, and that investors could withdraw the funds invested in the Companies upon request. (Id. ¶ 168.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ representations were false and intended to deceive and mislead the Plaintiffs as to the terms of the investment opportunity. (Id. ¶ 169.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants provided false information to the Plaintiffs regarding the Companies’ trading platform and services. (Id. ¶ 177.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants had a duty to disclose truthful information to the Plaintiffs about the Companies’ trading platform and services, including historically accurate rates of return and forex trading mechanisms. (Id. ¶ 178.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating the information that was provided to the Plaintiffs regarding the Companies’ trading platform and services, including historically accurate rates of return and forex trading mechanisms. (Id. ¶ 180.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants accepted millions of dollars from the Plaintiffs as a result of representations including the promise that the Plaintiffs would have the ability to withdraw their funds upon request, at any time. (Id. ¶ 186.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have prevented the withdrawal of the Plaintiffs’ funds since January 2023. (Id. ¶ 187.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants will be unjustly enriched if they are allowed to retain the Plaintiffs’ funds. (Id. ¶ 194.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have failed to release the Plaintiffs’ funds despite numerous requests in accordance with the Plaintiffs’ ownership rights in their funds, and their right to demand withdrawal at any time upon request. (Id. ¶ 197.) The Plaintiffs allege that CFT, FxWinning, and the Individual Defendants acted with a common purpose to defraud potential investors. (Id. ¶ 202.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ actions (including the representations discussed above) were done in furtherance of the Defendants’ common purpose. (Id. ¶ 203.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants established the Companies, and induced investors with promises of a proprietary algorithm, high returns, and secure and segregated accounts, with a common purpose to defraud the Plaintiffs and divest the Plaintiffs of millions of dollars. (Id. ¶ 204.) The Plaintiffs bring the following counts against the Defendants: (I) violation of the Securities Act of 1933 (against CFT and FxWinning); (II) violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 (against CFT, FxWinning, Renan de Rocha Gomes Bastos, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie); (III) violation of the Commodities Exchange Act (against CFT, FxWinning, Bastos, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie); (IV) violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act (against CFT, FxWinning, Bastos, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie); (V) breach of contract (against FxWinning); (VI) breach of fiduciary duty (against all Defendants); (VII) fraud in the inducement (against CFT, FxWinning, Bastos, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie); (VIII) negligent misrepresentations (against CFT, FxWinning, Bastos, Cardenas, and Brito Cutie); (IX) conversion (against all Defendants); (X) unjust enrichment (against all Defendants); and (XI) civil conspiracy (against all Defendants).

      "summary": "GoHealth was founded in 2001 and operates a health insurance marketplace. In the four years leading up to the IPO, GoHealth shifted its focus to signing up consumers for Medicare products, specifically Medicare Advantage plans. In the Registration Statement, GoHealth emphasized that its shift to Medicare enabled the Company to capitalize on “strong demographic trends,” as Medicare enrollment was expected to grow from approximately 61 million individuals in 2019 to approximately 77 million individuals by 2028, with 10,000 Americans turning 65 every day, and with an increasing proportion of Medicare-eligible individuals choosing commercial insurance solutions by enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans instead of basic Medicare. The Registration Statement stated that GoHealth estimated a “total addressable market” of $28 billion for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. The Registration Statement added that the Medicare market trends were poised to “drive a larger market in the coming years” that, when taken together with GoHealth’s “other product and plan offerings,” would result in an even larger addressable market. GoHealth described itself as primed to disrupt the traditional field agent-driven sales process for insurance, and specifically for Medicare, by using its digitally-enabled and technology-driven marketplace. Consumers using GoHealth to shop for insurance do not pay any fees for access to the Company’s platform or for enrollment or other services. Rather, GoHealth is typically paid an initial commission by health insurance carriers when consumers enroll in carriers’ products and become customers, and additional recurring commissions as long as those customers retain their health insurance plans. Therefore, customer “persistency” – i.e., customers staying enrolled in their health insurance plans – was necessary to counter “churn,” an industry term used to describe customers who drop from one insurance company’s plan in favor of a competitor’s plan. The Registration Statement touted GoHealth’s “strong” relationships with leading insurance carriers and its 19-year track record of “industry-leading” growth, pointing to a 52% compound annual growth rate between 2003 and 2019. The financial information included in the Registration Statement demonstrated GoHealth’s rapid growth leading up to the IPO. For example, the Registration Statement stated that GoHealth’s: (a) total commissions receivable, which represented expected future commission streams, was $388.8 million as of the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (“1Q2020”), an increase of 223.4% compared to the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 (“1Q2019”); (b) net revenues grew by 104.1% to $141.0 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to $69.1 million for 1Q2019, and by 138.5% to $539.5 million for pro forma 2019 compared to $226.2 million for 2018; (c) adjusted EBITDA grew by 394% to $35.2 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to $7.1 million for 1Q2019, and by 387.6% to $170 million for pro forma 2019 from $34.9 million for 2018; and (d) net income was $1.4 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to net income of $5 million for 1Q2019, and net income was $30.5 million for pro forma 2019 compared to net income of $28.1 million for 2018. The Registration Statement also stated that GoHealth’s recent focus on Medicare had contributed significantly to its growth, with total revenues generated in GoHealth’s Medicare segments growing to $124.2 million for 1Q2020 from $41.2 million for 1Q2019, representing a 201.5% increase, and to $432.7 million for pro forma 2019 from $112.2 million for 2018, representing a 285.7% increase. In the Medicare segments, GoHealth’s total submitted policies grew to over 132,000 Medicare policies for 1Q2020, as compared to 43,200 Medicare policies for 1Q2019, and over 427,000 Medicare policies for 2019 as compared to over 118,000 Medicare policies for 2018. The majority of the Company’s revenues and profits are generated in its Medicare segments, making those segments critically important to the Company’s financial performance. In 1Q2020, the Medicare segments generated 89% of the Company’s revenues, with the Medicare-Internal segment accounting for 68% of GoHealth’s total revenues and the Medicare-External segment accounting for 21% of total revenues. Within the Medicare segments, Medicare Advantage products generate the majority of net revenues, accounting for 75% of net revenues for the Medicare-Internal segment and 95% of net revenues for the Medicare-External segment during 1Q2020. Although the Company’s important Medicare-Internal segment, which focused on Medicare Advantage plans, generated the lion’s share of GoHealth’s revenues and drove GoHealth’s overall financial performance, it was concentrated heavily on just two insurance carrier customers: Humana Inc. (“Humana”) and Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”). In 2019, Humana and Anthem accounted for 40% and 20%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues. In 1Q2020, Humana and Anthem collectively accounted for 74% of the Company’s total revenues, up from 43% in 1Q2019. The Registration Statement stated that GoHealth’s key financial metric, a ratio that GoHealth calls “LTV/CAC,” was first among its peers. LTV/CAC is a shorthand description that divides the lifetime value of commissions that GoHealth estimated it would receive per “approved submission” (“LTV”) by the cost to convert a prospective customer into an actual one that signs up for an insurance policy with a carrier (“CAC”). As a result, LTV/CAC is a measure of the Company’s commissions relative to its customer acquisition cost. Despite being a critical metric to the Company’s financial performance, the complexity of GoHealth’s LTV/CAC made it impossible for investors to understand exactly how it was calculated for one period versus another or to calculate it for themselves. For example, the Company defined LTV/CAC in the Registration Statement as follows: “LTV/CAC” refers to the Lifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost, which we define as (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a prospect into a customer less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less other revenue and is presented on a per commissionable Approved Submission basis. Many of the metrics that went into GoHealth’s LTV/CAC were not reported individually, turning GoHealth’s critical financial metric into a veritable black box. Despite this, it is clear that GoHealth uses real-time data to continuously analyze and understand the day-to-day financial performance of its operations, including how those fluctuations impact GoHealth’s LTV/CAC. For example, the Company repeatedly emphasized as a main selling point to investors that GoHealth, in real time, collects data on all aspects of its business and various financial performance metrics. The Company uses advanced statistical models to calculate and predict LTV/CAC and the profitability and conversion probability of consumer leads, as well as future commission streams associated with each consumer enrolled in each specific plan product, all of which the Company uses to determine its total commissions receivable. With GoHealth’s eye-popping growth, swelling revenues, and industry-leading LTV/CAC, there was significant demand in anticipation of the IPO. On June 19, 2020, GoHealth filed a draft Registration Statement with the SEC on Form S-1. The Registration Statement was amended by a filing on July 8, 2020, which stated the IPO would consist of 39.5 million shares at an offering price of $19.00 per share. Then, on July 14, 2020, GoHealth increased the size of the Offering by 4.6 million shares, bringing the total Offering to 44.5 million shares. Two weeks after the close of the second quarter of 2020 (“2Q2020”), on July 14, 2020, GoHealth priced the IPO at $21.00 per share and filed the final Prospectus for the IPO, which forms part of the Registration Statement. By July 17, 2020, GoHealth completed the IPO, selling 44.5 million shares at $21.00 per share, generating over $913,500,000 in gross proceeds. The Registration Statement, in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act, contained materially false statements, omitted statements necessary to make the statements made in the Registration Statement not misleading, and failed to disclose information that was required to be disclosed therein. Specifically, unbeknownst to investors, because it was not disclosed in the Registration Statement, GoHealth was suffering heightened customer churn at the time of the IPO. In addition, GoHealth had reached the limits of the growth that could be achieved under its existing business model, and as a result, was required to radically depart from its business strategy leading up to the IPO in order to continue generating rapid revenue growth. To make this necessary change, the Company and its senior executives and officers planned to make 2020 an “investment year” for the Company, in which GoHealth would significantly and rapidly expand its insurance carrier customer base for Medicare. These plans created negative pressure on the Company’s critical LTV/CAC metric by, among other things: (a) lowering commission rates on approved submissions; (b) significantly increasing marketing expenses; (c) impairing persistency and generating a corresponding increase in customer churn, or, at a minimum, requiring GoHealth to increase its efforts (and costs) to combat churn; and (d) reducing GoHealth’s commissionable revenue in favor of increased non-commissionable revenue, which also dragged down GoHealth’s LTV and resulted in decreased persistency. GoHealth’s planned, but not disclosed, altering of its business strategy was necessary because, prior to and at the time of the IPO, the Company had relied heavily on just two Medicare carrier customers: Humana and Anthem. The Company had effectively maximized the growth that could be achieved by continuing to rely on these two carriers. Thus, in order to continue increasing its financial performance at the rate investors expected at the time of the IPO, GoHealth needed to route increasing numbers of Medicare-eligible consumers to a greater variety of insurance carriers while simultaneously expanding into new geographies. As a result, GoHealth needed to rapidly expand its base of insurance carrier customers. Rather than reading about GoHealth’s planned “investment year” in the Registration Statement as was required, investors learned of it in a series of post-IPO events. On August 19, 2020, GoHealth reported its financial results for 2Q2020 ended June 30, 2020, which closed two weeks before the IPO. During an after-hours conference call to discuss GoHealth’s 2Q2020 financial results and outlook, investors learned that GoHealth had added and was adding many new carriers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Kaiser, and “some other regional” Blue Cross Blue Shield providers as the Company “look[ed] towards 2021.” Investors also learned that when the Company added new Medicare insurance carrier customers, there was “an initial ramp-up period for new carriers with forecasted lower LTVs” and that the Company’s “strategy to add several new large carriers” was resulting and would continue to result in “lower initial commission rates and LTVs.” The “strategic decision” by the Company also included an increased focus on GoHealth promoting and selling Medicare “Special Needs Plans” (“SNPs”), which resulted in non-commissionable “other” revenue, that also created a “near-term drag on [GoHealth’s] average LTV” and resulted in higher disenrollment rates, e.g., churn. When GoHealth reported its third quarter financial results for the period ending September 30, 2020 (“3Q2020”), it not only reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was $0.64 worse than analyst estimates of a loss per share of $0.01, but it again increased its reliance on non-commissionable revenue to the detriment of commissionable revenue, creating more “near-term” drag on the Company’s average LTV. The extent to which 2020 was an “investment year” was made clear well after the IPO. On December 2, 2020, investors learned that GoHealth’s plan for 2020 included reduced, lower-than-normal commissions from newly added carriers and LTV compression, with the Company not seeing the “upside” until 2021. Specifically, during the Evercore ISI HealthCONx Conference on December 2, 2020, GoHealth’s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Co-Chair of the Company’s Board, Clinton P. Jones (“Jones”), stated: So we anticipated 2020 to be an investment year with new carriers. If you think about a new carrier, there’s technology integrations, there’s understanding other compliance and nuances, there’s understanding all the different plan options and plan types and building that out. [Indiscernible] side of things. So there’s a -- and we also -- when you add a new carrier, you’re typically not -- they don’t view you as anybody special, right? They’re going to give you just a normal commission level. You’ve got to prove yourself on volume and quality to move up the ranks. And typically, you’ll see LTV compression there because you don’t have the top commission rates, which we anticipated, we’ve modeled out, and we thought that would happen. As we think about where we’ve gone from a volume standpoint, we quickly rose through the ranks, we’ve proven ourselves, and we think there’s more upside in 2021 from an LTV standpoint with carriers. We also know more about their effectuation rates, rapid disenrollment rates, things we can look at in the reporting because other -- every carrier is reporting is different as well. Following Jones’ statements, GoHealth’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Travis J. Matthiesen (“Matthiesen”) added that the Company’s plan to add new carriers in 2020 created a “short-term drag on LTV” and that the Company would not get to “top-level contracts” with new carriers until “next year,” i.e., 2021. Matthiesen added that “it’s important to understand that new carriers really are a short-term drag on LTV[.]” Despite planning 2020 as an “investment year” prior to the IPO wherein GoHealth would suffer from lowered average LTV, increased reliance on SNPs with a corresponding decrease in commissionable revenue, increased marketing costs, and negative impacts on persistency and churn, these facts were not disclosed in the Registration Statement. Therefore, the Registration Statement, which GoHealth and the other Defendants used to secure more than $900 million from investors, contained materially false statements of fact and omitted material facts required to be disclosed in order to make the statements in the Registration Statement not misleading. The price of GoHealth stock has declined from the Offering price of $21.00 per share to $13.32 per share on the day this action was commenced, a 36% decline, to an all-time low of $10.05 per share on December 1, 2020, a 52% decline from the Offering price. As a result of Defendants’ violations of law, investors have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and damages under the Securities Act.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"DarkPulse, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New York. DarkPulse is a publicly traded company whose stock trades on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. FirstFire Global Opportunity Fund, LLC (“FirstFire”) is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in New York, New York. FirstFire is not registered as a securities dealer with the SEC. Upon information and belief, Defendant Eli Fireman is a permanent resident in New York. Fireman is the managing member of FirstFire Capital Management, LLC, which is the managing member of FirstFire. Fireman is not registered as a securities dealer with the SEC, nor is FirstFire Capital Management, LLC. Plaintiff alleges that FirstFire is a “death spiral” or “toxic” lender. According to Plaintiff, toxic lenders are unregistered securities dealers that make unlawful, predatory loans to small, publicly traded companies. In keeping with typical toxic lending arrangements, FirstFire allegedly gives itself the right to take payment of the debt in company stock, but with a substantial discount to the market price. Unlike a typical private-placement investor, FirstFire can immediately dump the stock into the public market to reap the difference between the discount and the market price. Moreover, because it can convert the debt in tranches, FirstFire is able to dump large quantities of the newly issued stock into the market and remain unaffected by the price depression that its selling tends to cause. FirstFire executed the first securities transaction with Plaintiff on September 20, 2018, when it purchased from Plaintiff a convertible promissory note, a type of debt security constituted by a promissory note and a share purchase agreement. FirstFire paid Plaintiff $225,000 for the note, for which Plaintiff was obligated to repay FirstFire $247,500 plus 8% interest, due in nine months. The note also gave FirstFire the right, commencing 180 days after purchase, to exchange all or any portion of the debt for company stock, at a 30% discount to the market price. By exercising the conversion option, FirstFire exchanged the debt under the note for newly issued company stock. On June 7, 2019, FirstFire began conversion of the September 2018 Note. In all, FirstFire effectuated 18 separate conversions under the September 2018 Note. Each of those 18 conversions, as well as the subsequent sales of the stock obtained thereby, are transactions in securities; with each conversion or sale, FirstFire used the mail and or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect a transaction in securities. In all, FirstFire exchanged $247,500 worth of debt for 879,400,000 shares of newly issued stock. The estimated open market value of the stock FirstFire acquired from converting the debt under the September 2018 Note totaled $10,738,900.00. Upon information and belief, as soon as FirstFire received the newly issued DarkPulse shares, it immediately sold them into the marketplace to reap a substantial profit. Plaintiff alleges that the average daily trading volume in DarkPulse stock increased dramatically in the days following each FirstFire conversion, demonstrating FirstFire’s well-known practice of dumping issuer stock into the market as soon as possible. On April 26, 2021, the parties executed a second securities transaction in which FirstFire purchased from Plaintiff a second convertible promissory note. In that transaction, FirstFire paid Plaintiff $750,000 for the note, which obligated Plaintiff to repay in the amount of $825,000.00, plus 10% APR in interest, with a nine-month maturity date. Unlike the fixed discount under the September 2018 Note, the April 2021 Note provided a fixed price of $0.015 per share; however, that price would reduce to $0.005 per share upon the occurrence of any incident of default. The April 2021 Note specified that it was governed by New York law. Unlike the September 2018 Note, the April 2021 Note contained the extra requirement that DarkPulse pay to FirstFire 60,000,000 “commitment shares” upon execution of the April 2021 Note. On the date of execution of the April 2021 Note, DarkPulse stock was trading at a price of $0.019 per share, giving the 60,000,000 commitment shares a face value of $1,140,000. FirstFire’s requirement that DarkPulse remit these shares (which, even with a sixmonth restriction, constitutes property with a fair market value in excess of $1,000,000) as up-front consideration for the $825,000 loan renders the April 2021 Note criminally usurious on its face under New York law. On October 14, 2021, the New York Court of Appeals issued its decision in Adar Bays, Inc., v. GeneSYS ID, 37 N.Y.3d 320 (2021), wherein that Court was called to answer two certified questions on the correct interpretation of New York criminal usury law. In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals held that under N.Y. G.O.L. § 5-511(1), a criminally usurious loan is void ab initio, even where the borrower is a corporation. The six-month restriction on the conversion stock (and the commitment shares) expired on October 26, 2021. On November 4, 2021, DarkPulse CEO Dennis O’Leary met with Fireman while on a business trip in Las Vegas, at Fireman’s request. Fireman presented O’Leary with a one-page amendment to the April 2021 Note, claiming that it would enable DarkPulse to complete future acquisitions without having to notify him. Fireman failed to mention to O’Leary that the amendment also replaced the choice of law provision, replacing governance by New York law with governance under Delaware law (which has no laws against usury), nor did he explain why the amendment was dated October 14, 2021, the date of the Adar Bays decision. O’Leary signed the amendment. On November 15, 2021, FirstFire submitted a notice of conversion seeking to convert the full amount of the debt under the April 2021 note (principal + interest = $886,875.00) into DarkPulse common stock. FirstFire’s November 15 notice of conversion (which is submitted to the transfer agent, not DarkPulse) claimed to be due shares using the default price of $.005 per share. Accordingly, on November 17, 2021, with DarkPulse stock trading at $0.1334 per share, the transfer agent delivered to FirstFire 177,375,000 shares of freely-trading stock, with an estimated fair market value of $23,661,825.00. Upon learning that the transfer agent had used the default conversion price, Plaintiff contacted FirstFire to raise its objections. In response, FirstFire filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking a declaratory judgment that not only was the default price correct, but that, under the default provisions of the Note, FirstFire is entitled to even further penalties. The market value of all of the shares obtained by FirstFire, including the “commitment shares” issued pursuant to the April 2021 Note and the shares acquired under the September 2018 Note, equals no less than $38,540,725.00. Every time FirstFire purchases a convertible note, converts debt into stock, or sells conversion stock, it effects a transaction in securities. As a part of its regular business, FirstFire acquires large volumes of shares directly from issuers at a substantial discount to market, sells large volumes of shares back into the open market for a substantial profit due to the conversion discount, and does so for its own account and absent investment intent. Accordingly, FirstFire buys securities, converts securities, and sells securities as part of its regular business for its own account. The SEC’s EDGAR database shows that since 2015, FirstFire has purchased similar convertible securities on over 200 occasions, from at least 89 microcap companies in addition to DarkPulse. Upon information and belief, FirstFire made use of the mails, email, and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect the DarkPulse Transactions and subsequent securities transactions. For example, FirstFire used its internet website, transferred cash through wire transfers, and used email and telephone communications to negotiate and effect purchases and sales. Via its website at www.firstfirecap.com, Defendant held itself out to the public as a “New York based investment manager” that “will source, structure, and execute direct investments in publicly traded companies with market capitalizations under $750 million.” FirstFire’s business of buying and selling securities is not exclusively intrastate. Any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for such person’s own account (through a broker or otherwise) as part of a regular business must register as a dealer with the SEC, or, in the case of a natural person, associate with a registered dealer. By failing to comply with the dealer registration requirements mandated by federal law, FirstFire purposefully “operated under the radar” to avoid important legal and regulatory oversight by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). The dealer registration requirements provide important safeguards for the investing public, shareholders and companies. The excessive compensation and patently unfair terms used in the DarkPulse Transactions (and FirstFire’s transactions with other issuers) would have violated FINRA Rules 5110 (b)(4)(B) and 5110(c)(2)(A), and hence could not have been effected by a registered securities dealer. FirstFire’s enormous profits from the DarkPulse Transactions resulted from the market prices they received when they sold the stock into the public market, and the deeply discounted price at which it acquired the stock from DarkPulse. This mechanism, where FirstFire reaps the profits on the spread or markup of the stock they sold, is a common attribute of a securities dealer or underwriter. Registration as a securities dealer and accompanying SEC oversight would further prevent FirstFire from utilizing the Rule 144 tacking provision (17 C.F.R. 230.144(d)(3)(ii)) because FirstFire’s business operations constitute underwriting activity, or sales with a view to distribution. As shown in EDGAR data, FirstFire had a regular clientele of issuers from which it would purchase securities, convert, and sell newly issued stock into the market to reap profits on the markup. Issuers of stock like DarkPulse are clients of underwriters. Operating as an underwriter is not acting as a trader, but as a securities dealer, which requires registration with the SEC. As a part of its regular business, Defendant obtained newly issued stock directly from the microcap issuers through note conversions, as opposed to purchases in the open or secondary markets. The convertible securities that Defendant purchased enabled it to acquire billions of shares of newly issued stock at a substantial discount—typically between 30 and 50 percent of the trading price. As a regular part of its business, Defendant sold large blocks of newly-issued shares into the public market, which is a common hallmark of a securities dealer. Between March 2015 and September 2021, Defendants purchased more than 107 convertible promissory notes from approximately 89 different penny stock issuers and sold more than 1 billion newly issued shares of stock obtained from those notes into the public market for Defendants’ own account. FirstFire has used the same business model– promising easy cash to microcap companies in need of working capital and then fleecing them for millions of shares of stock– since its formation in 2015. For example: • DigitalTown, Inc.: FirstFire purchased a convertible security for $183,750.00; upon conversion of that security, FirsfFire acquired more than 793,406,848 shares of DigitalTown stock (fair market value of $1,384,791.64) which, upon information and belief, were sold into the market shortly thereafter; • Ionix Technology, Inc.: FirstFire purchased one or more convertible securities for $665,000.00, upon conversion of that security, FirstFire acquired more than 9,467,000 shares of Ionix stock (fair market value $1,041,370.00) which, upon information and belief, it sold into the market shortly thereafter; and • Visium Technologies, Inc.: FirstFire purchased one or more convertible securities for $150,000.00, upon conversion of that security, FirstFire acquired more than 49,000,000 shares of Visium stock, (fair market value $196,000.00) which, upon information and belief, it sold into the market shortly thereafter. Defendants continue to purchase new convertible securities, convert the debt into stock and dump the stock into the market to reap profits. In 2021 alone, Defendant has purchased no less than 23 convertible promissory notes—from no less than 14 issuers. Upon information and belief, Defendants repeated the same behavior outlined above, utilizing the Rule 144 holding period to sell the conversion shares immediately upon conversion. The equitable remedy of voiding and rescission provided under § 29(b) of the Act should be effectuated by mandating FirstFire to return to DarkPulse every share of stock it acquired under the Agreements, less the cash value of the net sum provided to the Plaintiff for the purchase of the Notes. The FirstFire Lending Enterprise exists to lend money for profit using the business model described herein. Upon information and belief, the FirstFire Lending Enterprise has made loans to other issuers that also violate New York’s usury laws—in the same manner as the Agreements in this case which is by charging and/or collecting more than twice the lawful maximum interest rate. Collected in Violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 The Agreements evidence an unlawful debt under RICO because each one Charges more than twice the enforceable rate under New York law, and FirstFire is in the business of making usurious loans. The New York criminal usury statute provides: A person is guilty of criminal usury in the second degree when, not being authorized or permitted by law to do so, he knowingly charges, takes or receives any money or other property as interest on the loan or forbearance of any money or other property, at a rate exceeding twenty-five per centum per annum or the equivalent rate for a longer or shorter period. The Agreements are loans that must comply with New York usury laws. Pursuant to the express terms of the Agreements, FirstFire had the right to convert the debt into DarkPulse stock as repayment for the loan, but at a substantial discount of either, 30% to market or at $0. 005 (less than market value), at the time of conversion. The value of a fixed conversion discount is interest that must be included in the interest calculation for purposes of a usury analysis in New York. Both of the Agreements are governed by the laws of the state of New York, irrespective of the choice of law provisions within the Agreements. Pursuant to New York’s usury laws, the maximum enforceable legal rate for a loan to a corporation is 25% A.P.R. In accord with the landmark decision in Adar Bays, LLC v. GeneSYS, ID, Inc., 37 N.Y.3d 320 (N.Y. 2021), the Agreements are void ab initio, thus, any subsequent amendments that change the controlling law in the Agreements are a nullity. Although the Agreements impose a stated interest rate of either 8% or 10% per annum, the added value conferred by the commitment shares, conversion discounts, and original issue discounts produces an estimated 291.52% APR for the April 2021 Note and 61% for the Power Up Lending Grp., Ltd. v. Cardinal Energy Group, Inc., No. 2:16-cv-1545 (DRH) (GRB), 2019 BL 118785, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2019). In addition to the Agreements, many, if not all, of the other convertible promissory notes entered into by FirstFire with other securities issuers imposed substantially similar terms. The annualized interest is 291.52% A.P.R., which is calculated by adding the 10% stated interest rate on the note, the 10% OID on the note, the 133% conversion discount rate pursuant to the conversion provision on the note, and the 138.18% interest coming from the value received in the commitment shares outlined in the accompanying SPA. The annualized interest is 61% A.P.R., which is calculated by adding the 8% stated interest rate on the note, the 10% OID on the note, and the 43% conversion discount rate pursuant to the conversion provision on the note September 2018 Note – both of which are more than twice the enforceable rate permitted by New York’s criminal usury law (25%). As a result of the unlawful debt collection, DarkPulse has been injured in its business and property. As a result of the unlawful debt collection, FirstFire obtained tens of millions of shares of free-trading DarkPulse common stock to which it was not entitled or capable of lawfully acquiring. The excessive conversions and resulting issuances forced DarkPulse to increase its outstanding shares, thereby massively diluting DarkPulse’s stockholders. Once FirstFire began converting under the Agreements, its immediate and massive selling of large blocks of newly-issued shares of DarkPulse’s common stock into the public market caused enormous depression in DarkPulse’s market capitalization and stock price. As a result of these actions, DarkPulse became unable to privately raise money from other entities, with other toxic lenders becoming the only reasonably available option for short-term financing, leading to more losses. All of the foregoing harm was foreseeable by FirstFire and was proximately caused by FirstFire’s collection of an unlawful debt as alleged herein. Assessment of the total damage caused by these actions to DarkPulse is difficult to quantify and will be determined at trial. At all relevant times, Fireman, due to his position in FirstFire Capital Management LLC, possessed and exercised the ultimate decision-making and control over FirstFire, including the power to decide whether to enter into each of the securities transactions (including the DarkPulse Transactions), to negotiate and approve the final deal terms, and to direct its sales of stock. Fireman personally negotiated the terms of the convertible notes that FirstFire purchased from microcap companies (including the DarkPulse Transactions), as well as amendments to the original terms. Fireman also signed the contracts by which FirstFire acquired the convertible notes, including both Notes with Plaintiff. Ultimately, Fireman was and remains the sole person with the power to direct, authorize, and compel FirstFire to enter into, convert, and subsequently sell securities through usurious convertible notes with issuers, including the Agreements with Plaintiff. Fireman is, and was, a “controlling person” within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Act and had the power to cause FirstFire to engage in the unlawful conduct described herein.\", \"claim_rulings\": [{\"claim\": \"Count I (Violation of § 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and § 29(b) of the Act by Effecting the DarkPulse Transactions as an Unregistered Dealer)\", \"ruling\": \"dismissed\", \"reasoning\": \"Plaintiff failed to adequately plead that FirstFire acted as an unregistered dealer.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Defendant Wells Fargo is a bank that profits from its customers’ banking and lending activities. The individual Defendants are or were four Wells Fargo executives (Sloan, Shrewsberry, Scharf, and Parker) and one Wells Fargo director (Duke). Lead Plaintiffs are four entities that allege that they bought shares of Wells Fargo stock during the Class Period and suffered damages as a result of Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws. Wells Fargo is subject to the oversight of three national regulators: (i) the Federal Reserve; (ii) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”); and (iii) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) (collectively, the “Regulators”). This overlapping regulatory regime is designed to ensure comprehensive oversight of Wells Fargo’s compliance with applicable financial and consumer protection laws and the risks associated with its banking and lending activities. The Federal Reserve and OCC are vested by Congress with broad supervisory and enforcement powers, including the authority to monitor and enforce corrective action to ensure banking institutions do not violate the law. Beginning in 2008, Congress also vested the CFPB with overlapping authority with the Federal Reserve and OCC to supervise, examine, and penalize banks engaged in predatory banking practices. Each of these three Regulators has at its disposal the power to employ an escalating set of corrective actions to deter and punish unsafe and illegal lending and banking practices. The first and least severe remedy at the Regulators’ disposal is “non-public supervisory findings.” Notices containing such findings—which are confidentially issued to a bank—advise the bank to address identified weaknesses or deficiencies in its banking or lending practices. Such notices may take the form of either a notice of a “matter requiring attention” or a notice of a “matter requiring immediate attention.” When this type of confidential “call to action” does not result in sufficient reform, the Regulators may impose civil monetary penalties and more formal, public enforcement actions, such as a “consent order.” Public consent orders are “designed to prevent, deter, and correct violations of law and unsafe and unsound banking practices” and may require the bank to take certain steps, including remediating harmed customers. When this already powerful remedy fails, the Regulators may take even bolder action. These next-level remedies, which have rarely been utilized in U.S. history, are reserved for instances in which banks most egregiously harm customers and flagrantly break the law. These drastic remedies include imposing restrictions on the activities and functions a bank can undertake, restricting its growth (e.g., capping the bank’s assets), or directing the bank to remove particular officers or directors. Finally, just as the Regulators may give life to a bank in the form of a charter, they may take it away. When the Regulators’ other remedies fail, they may go so far as to withdraw a bank’s charter or seize the bank outright. Starting in 2015, the Regulators used these extensive powers in escalating fashion in response to the Bank’s widespread consumer abuses over the course of a decade and its epic failure to properly rectify its deficient risk management and oversight capabilities. On September 8, 2016, the CFPB and the OCC fined Wells Fargo $135 million for the widespread illegal practice of secretly opening deposit and credit card accounts without its customers’ authorizations. In addition, the CFPB and OCC mandated that Wells Fargo enter into coordinated consent orders aimed at preventing such misconduct from occurring in the future (the “2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders”). In the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders, the CFPB and OCC detailed the findings of their extensive investigations into Wells Fargo’s illegal and untoward practices. The CFPB and OCC documented how Wells Fargo employees were improperly (i) transferring funds from consumers’ accounts without their knowledge or consent into new accounts, with the customers unknowingly racking up associated fees and charges; (ii) causing customers to apply for credit card accounts without the customers’ authorization; (iii) issuing and activating debit cards to customers without the customers’ authorization; and (iv) creating phony email addresses to enroll its customers in online-banking services without their consent. The CFPB emphasized the gravity of Wells Fargo’s wrongdoing and its penalties. As the CFPB explained, “[b]ecause of the severity of [its] violations, Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed.” In imposing this record fine, the CFPB cautioned Wells Fargo and the industry that “[t]oday’s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences.” The OCC also explained that it initiated its enforcement action against Wells Fargo because the Bank suffered from “unsafe” and “unsound sales practices,” as well as unsafe and unsound “risk management and oversight.” To address those deficiencies, the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders required Wells Fargo to develop and implement an effective enterprise risk management program to detect and prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices and to mitigate further risks resulting from such practices. Investors and the press were justifiably troubled by the OCC and CFPB’s 2016 findings. For example, The New York Times wrote on September 8, 2016 that Wells Fargo’s “pervasive problems” “stand out given all of the scrutiny that has been heaped on large, systemically important banks since 2008,” and concluded that “[i]t is a particularly ugly moment for Wells.” The New York Times further noted that the Regulators’ findings “undercut” Wells Fargo’s previously developed “reputation on Wall Street as a tightly run ship” and “apple-pie approach.” The San Francisco Chronicle reiterated the next day that “[t]his is an ugly moment for Wells Fargo.” Wells Fargo ignored its Regulators’ 2016 warning shot. The Bank made minimal progress after the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders towards improving its oversight and risk management. In addition, the Bank’s illegal banking practices were found to be even more pervasive than originally determined. Wells Fargo had improperly (i) opened over 3.5 million sham bank accounts without client authorization, which was nearly twice as many as the Regulators initially thought; and (ii) charged hundreds-of-thousands of borrowers for unneeded and unrequested auto-protection insurance, which resulted in tens-of-millions of dollars in overcharges and caused customers to have their vehicles repossessed. On February 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously to impose its own consent order against Wells Fargo, requiring the Bank to comprehensively overhaul its governance and risk management processes to ensure that these ugly and illegal practices could never run rampant throughout the Bank again (the “2018 FRB Consent Order”). The written terms of the order were the result of weeks of negotiations between the Federal Reserve and Wells Fargo’s top executives, including Defendants Sloan, Shrewsberry, Duke, and Parker. In issuing the 2018 FRB Consent Order, the Federal Reserve explained that it had “previously identified deficiencies in [the Bank’s] risk management—including compliance risk management—that the [Bank] has yet to correct fully,” necessitating the imposition of the 2018 FRB Consent Order. Specifically, Wells Fargo “pursued a business strategy that emphasized sales and growth without ensuring that senior management had established and maintained an adequate risk management framework commensurate with the size and complexity of the Firm, which resulted in weak compliance practices.” The Federal Reserve concluded that “[w]e cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again.” As the financial press explained at the time, the 2018 FRB Consent Order was “the latest blow” against Wells Fargo, marking “the latest chapter in a series of scandals which have rocked the bank in recent years.” Lee Reiners, the Executive Director at Global Financial Markets Center at Duke University School of Law, explained that the 2018 FRB Consent Order was the “worst case scenario” for Wells Fargo and its directors, stating on February 6, 2018 that the Federal Reserve had “pointed its long finger directly at Wells Fargo’s Board of Directors and placed the blame for pervasive risk management failures squarely on their shoulders.” He concluded that the Federal Reserve’s action “should send a shiver down the spine of any bank director.” Bloomberg similarly stated on February 4, 2018 that, “[g]iven the Fed’s ongoing oversight,” Wells Fargo has “no other choice if it wants to escape the regulator’s wrath” than to comply with the 2018 FRB Consent Order. Securities analysts also recognized the importance of the 2018 FRB Consent Order to the Bank’s financial future and issued reports telling investors that they would be closely monitoring the Bank’s disclosures concerning its compliance with it. For example, Oppenheimer in a February 4, 2018 analyst report, wrote that one “cannot help but be struck by the searing nature of this rebuke” and cautioned investors to “remain on the sidelines.” And BMO Capital Markets wrote in its February 4, 2018 analyst report that “we’ve never seen anything like this before,” calling Wells Fargo a “cautionary tale” and downgrading its estimates and target price for Wells Fargo’s stock. In its 2018 FRB Consent Order, the Federal Reserve detailed a specific process through which Wells Fargo’s compliance would be measured, including benchmarks and timelines that the Bank would be required to meet before compliance could be claimed. Specifically, the Federal Reserve imposed three stages, outlined below, with specific, measurable, and time-bound parameters, that Wells Fargo needed to pass to comply with the 2018 FRB Consent Order. By no later than April 3, 2018 (within sixty days of the order), Wells Fargo was required to submit to the Federal Reserve “written plans that are acceptable to the Reserve Bank.” The Federal Reserve instructed that the Bank’s Stage 1 Plan needed to include “a timeline for full implementation with specific deadlines for the completion of each component of the plans.” The Stage 1 Plan also needed to document what the Bank would eventually implement and validate during the next two stages of the compliance process. The Stage 1 Plan was required to detail exactly how the Bank would institute an effective compliance and operational risk management program, as well as a program to ensure its Board effectively performed its duties to oversee and govern. The Federal Reserve made clear in its 2018 FRB Consent Order that the Bank could not advance to Stage 2 before submitting a compliant Stage 1 Plan and receiving the Federal Reserve’s approval. The 2018 FRB Consent Order specifically stated that Wells Fargo could advance to Stage 2 only after it was “notified in writing” that its Stage 1 Plan was “acceptable” to the Federal Reserve. Once Wells Fargo complied with Stage 1, by submitting a compliant Stage 1 Plan that the Federal Reserve approved in writing, Wells Fargo was then required to move into “adopting” and then “implementing” the approved Stage 1 Plans to Federal Reserve’s satisfaction. As stated in the 2018 FRB Consent Order, in this second stage, the Bank “shall adopt the approved plans” from Stage 1 within 10 days of their approval by the Federal Reserve and then, “[u]pon adoption [of the plans], WFC shall implement the approved plans and thereafter fully comply with them.” After completing the approved Stage 1 Plan’s implementation, Wells Fargo was next required to engage a third party to complete an “independent review” of the effectiveness of the Bank’s adoption and implementation of the approved plans. As stated in the 2018 FRB Consent Order, in a section titled “Third Party Reviews,” “[f]ollowing WFC’s adoption and implementation of the plans and improvement required under Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Order WFC shall conduct and complete by an appropriate date no later than September 30, 2018, an independent review of: (i) the Board’s improvements in effective oversight and governance of the [Bank], and (ii) enhancements to the [Bank]’s compliance and operational risk management program, each as required in this Order.” On February 2, 2018, the same day the Federal Reserve announced the 2018 FRB Consent Order, Wells Fargo confirmed its understanding of the 2018 FRB Consent Order’s three distinct stages and its commitment to submitting the required plans in a timely fashion and to engage a third party “to confirm adoption and implementation of the plans” under the Federal Reserve’s timeline. The Bank also published an investor presentation the same day, explaining that “[o]nce we adopt and implement these two plans as approved by the Federal Reserve, we will engage independent third parties.” Again, during a March 7, 2018 presentation to investors, when an analyst questioned Wells Fargo’s management about the “timeline” for compliance with the FRB Consent Order, Wells Fargo summarized that first, under Stage 1, “there was a requirement that we file a plan with the Federal Reserve within 60 days of the consent order,” and then “the Federal Reserve will make a determination as to whether or not our plan is adequate in the areas of operational risk, compliance and the board’s oversight of those activities.” Next, under Stage 2, “[w]e’ll then implement, once we’ve satisfied that they [the plans] are adequate and satisfied the Federal Reserve, we’ll implement those plans immediately.” And finally, under Stage 3, “we will engage a third-party to come in, and in effect, validate that we have adequately implemented those plans.” To ensure the Bank’s most senior leadership was well aware of the work imposed by the Federal Reserve at each stage, the 2018 FRB Consent Order required Wells Fargo’s directors to sign the 2018 FRB Consent Order. Defendants Sloan and Duke, along with the entire then-current Board, signed the 2018 FRB Consent Order. The Federal Reserve also sent letters on February 2, 2018 to each current Wells Fargo director, including Defendants Sloan and Duke, reinforcing the need for the Bank to comply with the 2018 FRB Consent Order and reprimanding the Board for its past failures to “meet our supervisory expectations.” In those letters, the Federal Reserve cautioned the members of the Bank’s Board that it would “continue to closely monitor the performance of WFC’s board in meeting supervisory expectations, including WFC’s compliance with today’s enforcement action,” and further warned that it expected the Board to “ensure that senior management establishes and maintains an effective risk management structure that has sufficient stature, authority, and resources.” The Federal Reserve also took the extraordinary step of demanding that Wells Fargo replace three current Board members by April 2018 and a fourth Board member by the end of 2018. To ensure the engagement of the highest leadership of the Bank, the Federal Reserve further required in its 2018 FRB Consent Order that, going forward, Wells Fargo’s “Board or an authorized committee thereof shall submit to the [Federal Reserve] written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the provisions of this Order and the results thereof.” In addition to demanding sweeping reform, the 2018 FRB Consent Order included an unprecedented remedy: Wells Fargo was prohibited from increasing the size of its assets until it satisfied all three stages of the 2018 FRB Consent Order. In announcing this “asset cap,” the Federal Reserve chastised the Bank for having “pursued a business strategy that prioritized its overall growth without ensuring appropriate management of all key risks.” The Federal Reserve concluded that “[t]he enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers.” Until Wells Fargo satisfied the 2018 FRB Consent Order by completing the three stages, the cap on its assets would remain in place and limit Wells Fargo’s ability to grow. The Federal Reserve’s imposition of an asset cap was a devastating blow to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo’s largest source of income is “net interest income,” which is the difference between the amount of interest income Wells Fargo generates on interest-earning assets (such as interest earned on lending activities to its customers) and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities (such as interest paid to customers on their deposits). Wells Fargo’s net interest income is adversely impacted by the asset cap. Without being able to increase interest-earnings assets, like loans, Wells Fargo cannot take advantage of interest-earning opportunities. This loss in revenue is exacerbated when, for example, federal interest rates are low, and the spread on the interest paid and interest earned decreases. To make up for the loss of interest revenue under such circumstances, Wells Fargo would need to increase the volume of its lending activities to offset the smaller spread—i.e., provide more loans at lower interest rates. Under the asset cap, however, Wells Fargo was prohibited from generating revenues in this manner because Wells Fargo would be required to increase the size of its assets to increase its loan volume—which is what the “asset cap” precluded. Analysts immediately recognized the adverse impact of the “asset cap” on the Bank’s financial strength. For example, Barclays issued an analyst report on February 4, 2018 titled, “In an Unprecedented Move, the Fed Caps WFC’s Balance Sheet Growth Until Governance and Controls Are Improved,” calling the asset cap “severe and unprecedented” and “a constraint that no bank we have covered during our 22.5 years on the sell-side has experienced.” Barclays analysts also described that the required “balance sheet optimization activities” to operate under the asset cap would “clearly keep WFC in the penalty box” and “likely result in a reduction to net interest income.” J.P. Morgan echoed these concerns on February 5, 2018, downgrading Wells Fargo’s stock because “the harsh Fed consent order is rare and a strong sign of regulators’ frustration about the very wide swath of areas where Wells has had issues,” and explaining that the “net income impact could be larger than simple loss from shrinking institutional deposits to accommodate planned loan growth—Wells could lose other revenues, both existing and potential, that it was trying to garner from these clients.” The financial press amplified these concerns. For example, on February 3, 2018, CNN Business noted that “[i]t is the first time the Federal Reserve has imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution,” explaining that the asset cap was an “unprecedented punishment.” Two days later, Bloomberg called the asset cap imposed upon Wells Fargo the “Fed’s ‘Fear of God’ Penalty.” It also reported how “[a]nalysts at firms including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citi are slashing their ratings on Wells Fargo after the Federal Reserve devised harsh new punishments in the wake of the bank’s scandals. They’re pointing to hits to growth, earnings, business opportunities and the potential for other painful regulatory action yet to come.” Wells Fargo’s other two regulators—the OCC and CFPB—imposed additional coordinated consent orders on the Bank on April 20, 2018 (the “2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders” and together with the 2018 FRB Consent Order, the “2018 Consent Orders”), and fined the Bank over $1 billion for its continued failure to correct its risk management and oversight. As the OCC and CFPB explained, the Bank flouted the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders and continued to operate in a manner that was “reckless, unsafe, or unsound” and that violated federal banking and lending laws. The 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders required Wells Fargo to fix its compliance risk management"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Lead Plaintiff Steven Christiansen brings a securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of Spectrum common stock during the period March 17, 2022 through September 22, 2022, who were damaged thereby. The claims asserted in this consolidated action are alleged against Spectrum, Thomas J. Riga, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company’s board of directors, Francois J. Lebel, the Company’s former Executive Vice President and former Chief Medical Officer, and Nora E. Brennan, the Company’s EVP and Chief Financial Officer and former member of the Company’s board of directors, and arise under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading representations or by failing to disclose material facts they had a duty to disclose while selling millions of shares of Spectrum common stock at artificially inflated prices. Before any new drug can be marketed and sold commercially in the U.S., the United States Food and Drug Administration requires that the drug undergo clinical trials involving three phases of human testing, with each phase involving increasingly larger patient pools. Typically, Phase 1 trials test the safety, dose tolerance, and other properties of the drug; Phase 2 trials seek to gather information about efficacy, optimal dosage levels, adverse effects, and safety risks; and Phase 3 trials are designed to gather further efficacy and safety information used to evaluate a drug’s overall benefit/risk profile. In a Phase 3 trial involving anti-cancer drugs, the drug candidate is typically compared to a standard, FDA-approved treatment for the target disease to verify clinical benefit or lack of benefit, and study patients are randomly assigned to receive the drug candidate or the standard of care treatment. After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective, a new drug application can be filed with the FDA requesting approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease. However, in cases where a drug candidate treats a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need, the FDA developed the Accelerated Approval pathway for earlier approval of drugs that demonstrate an effect on an endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Accelerated Approval is typically based on Phase 2 study data results. For a drug candidate granted approval under the Accelerated Approval pathway, the FDA has postmarketing requirements, which are typically additional studies or clinical trials designed to confirm or verify clinical benefit. Postmarketing requirements are typically one or more Phase 3 randomized controlled studies, referred to as confirmatory studies or trials. FDA guidance provides that at the time Accelerated Approval is granted, a Phase 3 confirmatory trial should already be underway because Phase 3 confirmatory trials that are in progress at the time Accelerated Approval is granted are more likely to result in a timely verification of benefit, and mitigate the risks that patients are exposed to undue risks by an ineffective drug granted Accelerated Approval. In or around October 2017, Spectrum commenced a clinical development program for pozi that included a Phase 2 study of pozi’s efficacy and safety, referred to as Cohort 2. Cohort 2 comprised 90 patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations and all patients were to be treated with 16 mg of pozi QD. In a July 27, 2020 press release, Spectrum stated that Cohort 2 had met its primary endpoint, and in December 2020, Spectrum disclosed that the FDA allowed the Company to file an NDA based on the Cohort 2 study data results under the Accelerated Approval pathway. On November 24, 2021, Spectrum completed its submission of the NDA for pozi at a 16 mg QD dose in patients with previously treated NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations, and sought Accelerated Approval for the 16 mg QD dose based on the Phase 2 study data results from Cohort 2. Spectrum’s postmarketing requirement, or Phase 3 confirmatory trial, was called the PINNACLE Study. In November 2021, during Spectrum’s earnings conference call with investors announcing the Company’s third quarter 2021 financial results, an analyst asked Defendant Lebel, the Company’s CMO, “what confirmatory study are you committing to in terms of design? Because obviously you need to do that as part of the Accelerated Approval?” In response, Defendant Lebel stated: . . . we’re in discussion with the FDA regarding this, and we clearly have developed a postmarketing requirement. And when you file the NDA, you have to have a postmarketing requirement essentially underway and so we absolutely intend to do that. But obviously, want to make sure we’re in complete agreement . . . as to the nature of the postmarketing requirement. So I’m not going to go any further on that, but it’s probably a randomized controlled study . . . And we’ll need to define that with the FDA and probably quite soon, you will be able to see what we’re doing. In February 2022, Spectrum told investors that the FDA had accepted the Pozi NDA for review, that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA set November 24, 2022 as the date by which the FDA would approve the Pozi NDA, reject it, or issue a complete response letter, and that the “FDA [had] reiterated [to Spectrum] the importance of having the confirmatory trial substantially enrolled at the time of Accelerated Approval . . .”. The Class Period begins on March 17, 2022, when, during Spectrum’s conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter 2021 and full-year 2021 financial results, Defendant Riga represented that “we have learned to optimize” the dosage for pozi. Dose optimization data identifies a dosage that provides optimal balance of efficacy and safety needed to maximize the chances of a successful outcome in a Phase 3 study. Defendant Riga’s representation that Spectrum had learned to “optimize” the dosage for pozi was materially false and misleading because, unknown to investors, during meetings with Defendants Lebel and/or Riga before the Class Period, the FDA repeatedly told Defendants Lebel and/or Riga that Spectrum’s dosing data were inadequate and that additional data and studies were needed to determine whether Spectrum’s dose selection for pozi was optimized. The sticking point for the FDA was that while patients in Cohort 2 were treated with 16 mg QD and the Pozi NDA sought Accelerated Approval to treat patients with a 16 mg QD dose, Defendants Riga and/or Lebel proposed to treat patients in the PINNACLE Study with a different dosage regimen in an effort to mitigate negative side effects observed in Cohort 2 while maintaining efficacy. The incongruent dosing schedules troubled and concerned FDA officials. While Spectrum had submitted with the Pozi NDA dosing data from a Phase 1 study and additional dosing data, including from an ongoing pozi exploratory trial in which patients were treated with 6 or 8 mg BID, or 10 mg QD, the FDA repeatedly told Defendants Riga and/or Lebel that the data were inadequate and that additional dosing data and studies were required to determine the optimal dose for further evaluation in the PINNACLE Study. The FDA also repeatedly expressed concerns to Defendants Lebel and/or Riga that pozi’s efficacy was low and did not represent an advantage to patients over other approved therapies, and that the safety profile demonstrated a high level of toxicity, requiring a large number of dose reductions and drug interruptions. In light of the FDA’s concerns, the FDA informed Defendants Riga and/or Lebel that additional data were needed to determine whether the pozi dose was optimized for further evaluation in the PINNACLE Study. As revealed after the Class Period by the FDA, Spectrum’s failure to optimize the dosage was a “fatal flaw” in the development of pozi. Also during the March 17, 2022 conference call, Defendant Lebel stated that Spectrum would disclose the design and details of the PINNACLE Study after the first patient was enrolled. Then, on May 12, 2022, Defendants Riga and Lebel disclosed the design and details of the PINNACLE Study, and represented that patients were enrolling in the PINNACLE Study: A study for poziotinib has been initiated to confirm the clinical benefit seen in Cohort 2, as required for an accelerated approval. The trial, Study SPI-POZ-301 (PINNACLE), is designed to enroll 268 patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations. Patients are being randomized 2-to-1 into one of two treatment arms using 8mg of poziotinib orally administered BID (twice daily) versus 75mg/m2 of docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. The primary endpoint will be Progression Free Survival. Also on May 12, 2022, during a Spectrum conference call with investors, an analyst asked Defendants Riga and Lebel “how do you reconcile a full approval in a different dose [16 mg QD] with the Accelerated Approval with a sort of different dosing schedule?” Defendant Riga responded “we believe that 16 QD is a safe and effective dose and obviously aligned with FDA on the confirmatory study to go with the 8-milligram BID.” Defendants’ representations were materially false and misleading because they created the false impression that the PINNACLE Study was enrolling patients and that PINNACLE was on track to be substantially enrolled by November 24, 2022, when, in fact, no patients had enrolled, and that Defendants and the FDA were aligned concerning the design of the PINNACLE Study to treat patients at the 8 mg BID dose, which was not true. Unknown to investors, in light of the FDA’s concerns about the inadequate dose optimization data, and pozi’s efficacy and safety data, the FDA did not agree with Defendants on the design of the PINNACLE Study and had warned Defendants Lebel and/or Riga that proceeding with PINNACLE at 8 mg BID was at their own risk. Unknown to investors, as of May 12, 2022, no patients had enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. As later revealed at a public meeting of the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee on September 22, 2022 at the end of the Class Period to discuss the Pozi NDA and to vote whether to recommend that the FDA grant Accelerated Approval to the Pozi NDA based on a benefit-risk analysis, FDA officials repeated what they had been privately telling Defendants Lebel and/or Riga since before the start of the Class Period: we did not come to any formal agreement about the 8-mg BID dose. It’s very limited data, and we told Spectrum that it would be at their own risk to move forward with this incongruent dose . . . I think a lot of this speaks to Spectrum kind of rushing this development program and trying to take catch-up steps, whereas the steps should have been taken slowly, and methodically, and appropriately early in development. . . . Defendants have missed several opportunities and several steps along the way to optimize this dose . . . This is a fatal flaw in this development program . . . . Proceeding with a drug development program when you don’t have a well-founded dose is literally building a house on quicksand here, and this is one of the problems . . . . PINNACLE has not enrolled any patients as of this month, and is not slated to read out until 2026 at the earliest. Patients could be exposed to a highly toxic drug with unverified clinical benefit for at least four years. Indeed, Defendants’ false representations misled analysts that covered Spectrum. For example, a May 16, 2022 report published by JMP Securities LLC stated “Spectrum noted that it has started enrolling patients” in the PINNACLE Study “which needs to be substantially enrolled by” November 2022; a May 13, 2022 report published by H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC stated “the PINNACLE study utilizing 8 mg BID bodes well for the potential approval”; and in a May 13, 2022 research report, Jefferies LLC reported that Spectrum “announced alignment w/FDA on confirmatory ph.III design . . . the confirmatory study is an important moving part, b/c FDA has iterated the importance of having the confirmatory trial ‘substantially enrolled’ by the time of approval”, when, in fact, Spectrum was not aligned with the FDA on the design of the PINNACLE Study and at that point no patients had been enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. Defendants were motivated to take a risky gamble and prematurely rush the Pozi NDA and the PINNACLE Study without the dose optimization data required by the FDA and mislead investors because Spectrum was in a precarious financial condition and needed to raise cash. Spectrum was on track to run out of cash by the end of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, Spectrum reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $100 million and had reported spending at least $25 million per quarter. During the period April 2022 through May 12, 2022, Defendants Riga and Brennan caused Defendant Spectrum to sell 1.4 million shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of $1.4 million under an at-the-market sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., H.C. Wainwright and B. Riley FBR, Inc., dated April 5, 2019. On May 18, 2022, Defendants Riga and/or Lebel met with the FDA, and FDA officials again expressed concerns regarding the safety profile of pozi, particularly at the 16 mg QD dose, given the high rate of dose reductions and dose interruptions. FDA stated that additional clinical data at a dosage of 8 mg BID and other dosages was necessary to assess the risk-benefit profile. FDA expressed concern to Defendants Riga and/or Lebel about the delayed enrollment in the PINNACLE Study and communicated that based on the ongoing review, uncertainties remained regarding whether the proposed dosage for Accelerated Approval of 16 mg QD is optimized from both the efficacy and safety perspectives. Unknown to investors, as of May 18, 2022, no patients had enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. During the period May 13 through June 30, 2022, Defendants Riga and Brennan caused Defendant Spectrum to sell 4,219,827 shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of $3,547,000 under the April 2019 ATM Agreement. On July 28, 2022, Defendants Riga and/or Lebel met with the FDA to discuss the adequacy of dosage optimization to support both the proposed dose of 16 mg QD for Accelerated Approval and the mg BID dose for PINNACLE Study. The FDA reiterated its concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of pozi, that Defendants had inadequate data on dosing, and that the Company delayed enrollment in the PINNACLE study. Specifically, the FDA stated that the proposed dosage of 16 mg QD for Accelerated Approval did not appear adequately justified and additional data was required to compare the benefit-risk profiles of the 16 mg QD to alternative dosage regimens. Additionally, the FDA asked Defendants Riga and/or Lebel for an update on the PINNACLE Study. Unknown to investors, as of July 28, 2022, no patients had been enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. During the period July 2022 through August 12, 2022, Defendants Riga and Brennan caused Defendant Spectrum to sell 5.1 million shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of approximately $4.5 million under the April 2019 ATM Agreement. On August 11, 2022, Defendants Riga, Lebel and Brennan caused Spectrum to issue a press release concerning the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that represented: A study for poziotinib is in progress to confirm the clinical benefit seen in Cohort 2, as required for an accelerated approval. The trial, Study SPI-POZ-301 (PINNACLE), is designed to enroll 268 patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations. Patients are being randomized 2-to-1 into one of two treatment arms using 8mg of poziotinib orally administered BID (twice daily) versus 75mg/m2 of docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. The primary endpoint is progression free survival. Also on August 11, 2022, during a Spectrum conference call with investors, an analyst asked Defendants Riga, Lebel and Brennan “on the PINNACLE Study, how many sites are active right now? What percentage of your target patients have been enrolled in Phase III? And where do you need to be on enrollment to satisfy FDA’s focus on substantial enrollment by November 24, 2022?” While knowing, or at least recklessly disregarding, that FDA had repeatedly expressed concerns about pozi’s efficacy, safety and lack of adequate dosing optimization data, that Spectrum and the FDA did not agree on the design of the PINNACLE Study and that Defendants were pressing forward in the face of being told by the FDA that they were proceeding at their own risk, and that as of August 11, 2022 no patients had enrolled in the PINNACLE Study, Defendant Lebel made the following materially false and misleading statements: “we’re very active in opening site[s]. But as I’m sure you know, it takes a long time to open sites. We have some site[s] open. I’m not going to give you numbers today. I’m not going to speak directly to enrollment today. And so we’re moving as fast as we can internationally as well as in North America.” Defendant Lebel’s false and misleading representations reaffirmed investors’ impression about the status of the PINNACLE Study that differed in a material way from the one that actually existed, in violation of the federal securities laws. Indeed, on August 12, 2022, H.C. Wainwright published a report concerning Spectrum that stated “the PINNACLE study utilizing 8 mg BID bodes well for the potential approval.” During the period August 13 through September 30, 2022, Defendant Riga and Brennan caused Defendant Spectrum to sell 13,794,118 shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of $17,113,000 under the April 2019 ATM Agreement. On September 8, 2022, Defendants Riga and/or Lebel met with the FDA. The FDA reiterated its concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of pozi, that Defendants had inadequate data on dosing, and that the Company had delayed the PINNACLE study. Specifically, the FDA indicated that based on the ongoing review, uncertainties remained regarding whether the proposed dosage of 16 mg QD was optimized from both the efficacy and safety perspectives. The FDA again stated that additional clinical data was needed to compare the benefit-risk profiles of the 16 mg QD dosage to alternative dosage regimens. Unknown to investors, as of September 8, 2022, no patients had been enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. Starting on September 20, 2022, before the market opened, investors began to learn the truth when the FDA released the FDA Briefing Document in anticipation of its September 22, 2022 meeting with Defendants Spectrum and Lebel to review the Pozi NDA. Investors were surprised when, despite Riga and Lebel’s representations that Spectrum had learned to optimize the dosage for pozi, and that Spectrum was enrolling patients in the PINNACLE Study, the"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"DocGo is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located in New York City. DocGo offers medical transportation and mobile health services in the United States and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2023, DocGo had 104,055,168 shares of common stock outstanding, which trade in an efficient market on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DCGO.” Vashovsky co-founded DocGo and served as DocGo’s CEO until January 2023. Vashovsky has served as the Chairman of DocGo’s Board of Directors since 2015. Capone joined Ambulnz in 2017 and served as Ambulnz’s President, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Product Officer from 2017 until DocGo’s Business Combination in 2021. Capone served as DocGo’s President until January 2023. Capone served as DocGo’s CEO from January 2023 until his abrupt resignation in September 2023. Oberholzer served as DocGo’s CFO from 2015 until January 2023. In January 2023, Oberholzer became DocGo’s Treasurer and Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. The Individual Defendants, together with DocGo, are referred to herein as “defendants.” Defendants are liable under §§10(b) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act for DocGo’s false and misleading Class Period statements. During the Class Period, the Individual Defendants, as senior executive officers and/or directors of DocGo, were privy to confidential, proprietary information concerning DocGo, its finances, operations, financial condition, and present and future business prospects. The Individual Defendants also had access to material adverse nonpublic information concerning DocGo, as discussed in detail below. Because of their positions with the Company, the Individual Defendants had access to nonpublic information about its finances, business, markets, products, and present and future business prospects via internal corporate documents, conversations, and connections with other corporate officers and employees, via attendance at management and/or Board meetings and committees thereof, and via reports and other information provided to them in connection therewith. Because of their possession of such information, the Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the adverse facts specified herein had not been disclosed to, and were being concealed from, the investing public. The Individual Defendants are liable as direct participants in the wrongs complained of herein. In addition, the Individual Defendants, by reason of their status as senior executive officers and/or directors, were “controlling persons” within the meaning of §20(a) of the 1934 Act and had the power and influence to cause the Company to engage in the unlawful conduct complained of herein. Because of their positions of control, the Individual Defendants were able to, and did, directly or indirectly, control the conduct of DocGo’s business. The Individual Defendants, because of their positions with the Company, controlled and/or possessed the ability and authority to control the contents of DocGo’s reports, press releases, and presentations to securities analysts and, through them, to the investing public. The Individual Defendants were provided with copies of the Company’s reports and press releases alleged herein to be misleading, prior to or shortly after their issuance, and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or cause them to be corrected. Thus, the Individual Defendants had the opportunity to commit the fraudulent acts alleged herein. As senior executive officers and/or directors and as controlling persons of a publicly traded company whose stock was, and is, registered with the NASDAQ and governed by the federal securities laws, the Individual Defendants had a duty to promptly disseminate accurate and truthful information with respect to DocGo’s financial condition, performance, growth, operations, financial statements, business, products, markets, management, earnings, and present and future business prospects, and to correct any previously issued statements that had become materially misleading or untrue, so that the market price of DocGo stock would be based upon truthful and accurate information. The Individual Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions during the Class Period violated these specific requirements and obligations. The Individual Defendants are liable as participants in a fraudulent scheme and course of conduct that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of DocGo securities. The scheme: (a) deceived the investing public regarding DocGo’s business, operations, and management and the intrinsic value of DocGo securities; and (b) caused Lead Plaintiff and members of the Class to purchase DocGo securities at artificially inflated prices. DocGo provides healthcare transportation and mobile services for hospitals and health systems, health plans, governments, and municipalities in the United States and the United Kingdom. DocGo markets itself as a technology company and a leading provider of mobile healthcare services. DocGo began as Motion Acquisition Corp., a blank check company formed by business executives in the transportation software and technology sector. A blank check company is sometimes referred to as a special purpose acquisition company, or “SPAC,” and does not initially have any operations or business of its own. Rather, it raises money from investors in an initial public offering and then uses the proceeds from the offering to acquire a business or operational assets, usually from a private company that does not publicly report financial or operating results. Motion completed its IPO on October 19, 2020. Motion’s business objective, as stated in its IPO offering documents, was “to identify, acquire and operate a business in the telematics industry,” an interdisciplinary field encompassing telecommunications, vehicular technologies, electrical engineering, and computer science. On January 6, 2021, Motion signed a letter of intent to combine with Ambulnz, which was then a private company. On March 9, 2021, Motion and Ambulnz announced they had entered into the Business Combination agreement on March 8, 2021. On October 14, 2021, Motion filed with the SEC a final proxy for the merger recommending shareholders vote in favor of the Business Combination. On November 2, 2021, Motion shareholders approved the Business Combination. On November 5, 2021, Motion and Ambulnz issued a release announcing the completion of the Business Combination. Ambulnz was merged with and into a subsidiary of Motion, with Motion as the surviving entity, and Motion’s named changed to DocGo Inc. Motion also assumed the business and operations of Ambulnz, allowing Ambulnz to become publicly traded as DocGo. During the Class Period, DocGo had two business segments: Transportation Services and Mobile Health. DocGo’s Transportation Services segment provided emergency response and nonemergency transportation services offered under the Ambulnz brand (a wholly-owned subsidiary of DocGo after the Business Combination). DocGo’s Mobile Health segment provided healthcare at home and offices, testing, vaccinations, and event services, including onsite healthcare support at sporting events and concerts. The Company’s mobile health services included onsite evaluation, diagnostics, triage, and treatment. Throughout and prior to the Class Period, DocGo promoted itself as a technology company positioned at the intersection of healthcare and technology. According to Capone: “DocGo, when you look at its heart, is really a technology company. From day one when we built the company, that was going to be our focus.” Critical to DocGo’s messaging on technology was AI. While DocGo was promoting itself as a technology company, AI experience and capabilities were increasingly being recognized as important differentiators, particularly for high growth and startup companies. According to a September 27, 2021 Harvard Business Review article titled: “AI Adoption Skyrocketed Over the Last 18 Months,” startups were “targeting established industries by employing the latest data-driven technologies to enter new markets with new solutions.” And growth in the AI healthcare market was projected to skyrocket. As noted in a July 11, 2023 IBM.com article titled: “How can artificial intelligence benefit healthcare?,” the AI healthcare market, “valued at $11 billion in 2021, is projected to be worth $187 billion in 2030. That massive increase means we will likely continue to see considerable changes in how medical providers, hospitals, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and others in the healthcare industry operate.” At the same time, many companies were finding it hard to attract employees with necessary AI experience. According to a McKinsey article titled: “The state of AI in 2022 – and a half decade in review”: Unfortunately, the tech talent shortage shows no sign of easing, threatening to slow that shift for some companies. A majority of respondents report difficulty in hiring for each AI-related role in the past year, and most say it either wasn’t any easier or was more difficult to acquire this talent than in years past. AI data scientists remain particularly scarce, with the largest share of respondents rating data scientist as a role that has been difficult to fill . . . . Against this backdrop, DocGo sought to capitalize on the growing AI wave. DocGo’s “technology backbone” purportedly was a proprietary central AI system that managed the logistics behind DocGo’s scheduling, patient interactions, and resource allocation. Based on the Company’s representations, analysts believed DocGo’s AI technology platform to be the Company’s largest differentiator in ambulance services and mobile health. Needham & Company, which covered DocGo during the Class Period, described DocGo’s proprietary AI platform as the Company’s “secret sauce.” On June 21, 2023 Canaccord Genuity, which also covered DocGo during the Class Period, wrote: “To be clear, the technology platform is the largest differentiator for DocGo with management emphatically defining itself as a technology company.” On August 18, 2023, BTIG, which also covered DocGo during the Class Period, wrote: DCGO’s underlying advanced proprietary technology is the core of the company and drives DCGO’s value. Its platform is also the key differentiator that gives it an edge over competitors. * * * DCGO has framed itself as a tech company that is at the cross-section between healthcare and technology. Critical to the Company’s purported technology platform were Capone and his education in AI. For example, on March 15, 2023, at an Oppenheimer Healthcare Conference, Capone specifically linked DocGo’s “technology backbone” to his personal background: Now, again, the whole piece that we have is on top of our technology backbone. That technology backbone allows for the procurement, the dispatching, the automation of our services. And to emphasize again, DocGo’s technology is at the same level [a]s the best technology companies in the world. Although we are a services company where we deliver, we derive nearly all of our revenue from services, clinical services provided in the field. The technology that we have is of the same caliber of some of the true technology companies that sell technology, that is what they make their money from. Part of that’s due to the fact that that’s my background. That’s kind of where I’m heavily weighted towards. And so, every solution – every problem that we have, we answer with a technology solution. We deploy code [to] production six to seven times every single day, millions and millions of lines of code doing highly sophisticated AI-based solutions that do all the routing, the dispatching, and the predictive analytics to know who you dispatch to, where, and why. Indeed, throughout and prior to the Class Period, Capone repeatedly highlighted his purported graduate degree in computational learning theory to investors, customers, and the public in an effort to boost DocGo’s prospects and capabilities. On June 16, 2021, Vashovsky and Capone submitted a “Proposal to the New Jersey Department of Health Office of the Commissioner (the “Proposal”) on behalf of Ambulnz, DocGo’s medical transportation subsidiary. The Proposal included Capone’s résumé, which stated that Capone had earned a Masters of Computational Learning Theory from Clarkson University in May 2014. The Proposal also represented Capone had earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, and a Bachelor of Arts in Law – each “Sum Cum Laude” – from SUNY Potsdam in May 2009: Capone frequently highlighted his supposed academic pedigree when speaking to investors, expressly connecting his advanced degree in AI to the foundational strengths of the Company. For example, on September 13, 2022, while President of DocGo, Capone stated at an H.C. Wainwright Global Investment Conference: So Stan [Vashovsky] came in. Clinical background: paramedic for 28 years, had been in health care for almost that entire time. My background: I originally – when we started the company, I’m our Chief – was our Chief Technology Officer. My graduate degree is in computational learning theory, which was a subset of artificial intelligence. And so we brought those two together. We melded this need on the medical side with the understanding that I had on the computer science side, and, together, we built that. The next day, on September 14, 2022, at a Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference, Capone again emphasized his graduate degree in computational learning theory to investors: My name is Anthony Capone, currently the President at DocGo. Originally, when we formed the company, I was our Chief Technology Officer. That’s kind of where my background is in. My grad degree is in computational learning theory, which is a discrete subset of computer science, artificial intelligence. On November 7, 2022, DocGo issued a release announcing Vashovsky was retiring as CEO. DocGo’s Board appointed Capone as CEO, effective January 1, 2023. In the release, Vashovsky stated: “I am extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish as a company these past seven years, introducing an entirely novel way of delivering quality care that is beneficial to both patients and payers alike. We are very fortunate to have someone with Anthony’s skill set and track record to take the reigns [sic] as CEO next year, and I have every confidence in the continued growth and success of this company.” However, at no time before appointing Capone as CEO did Vashovsky or the rest of DocGo’s Board bother to verify the accuracy of Capone’s educational credentials. After the Board appointed Capone as CEO, Capone continued to tout his credentials in the rapidly expanding field of AI to investors. For example on January 12, 2023, at a JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Capone stated: My name is Anthony Capone, as introduced there. I’m Chief Executive Officer. We started the company about 6.5 years ago; I was our Chief Technology Officer. My background, my grad degree is in computational learning theory, which is a subset of AI. So I’m on the technology side. And as I’ll go through, our founder is on the clinical side, and we bring the two together to deliver a true, true healthcare service that’s built on top of very sophisticated technology backbone. Later in the same presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Capone again touted his academic credentials: Now one of the key parts, and I like to talk about this quite a lot because it’s my background, my graduate degree is in computational learning theory, is our technology. Everybody says they have technology. Everybody has got some app that they like to have. This is not that. Capone also repeatedly inserted references to his credentials into messaging about the AI capabilities of DocGo. On August 9, 2023, at a Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference, Capone stated: We started the company. I was our Chief Technology Officer, my graduate degree [is] in computational learning theory, which is a subset of artificial intelligence and all of the tech that we have at DocGo whether that tech [is] to distribute, dispersed, dispatch, thousands and thousands of people every single day to varying different settings across the entire globe, or whether that’s the ability to pair together the medical necessity of a patient with a clinical competency of a provider, all of that is done with high sophistication, with our AI systems in order to need as little people as possible. Unbeknownst to investors, however, Capone had not earned a graduate degree in computational learning theory or any other field of study from Clarkson University or any other institution. In fact, Capone had never even enrolled in any graduate program at Clarkson University. Nor had Capone earned a triple summa cum laude undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam. On September 14, 2023, Albany’s Times Union published an article titled: “DocGo CEO Anthony Capone admits he didn’t earn graduate degree.” In the article, Capone admitted he had never earned any master’s degree and refused to confirm that he even held an undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam, let alone a triple summa cum laude degree, as he had previously represented: This week, the Times Union found another discrepancy involving DocGo: Anthony Capone has said he went to the State University of New York at Potsdam for his undergraduate degree, according to his biography on the company’s website. Capone’s biography also says he received a graduate degree in artificial intelligence from Clarkson University, which has a campus in Potsdam. But a spokesman for Clarkson University said the school has no record of Anthony Capone enrolling in or completing a graduate degree at the university. Late Thursday, Capone responded through his spokesman and admitted in a statement the information is false. “I want to address a serious issue concerning incorrect information about my educational background. Specifically, it has come to my attention that my public biography erroneously states that I hold a [master]’s degree from Clarkson University,” Capone said. “I must clarify immediately: I do not have a master’s degree from Clarkson University, nor from any other institution. This inaccuracy should have been corrected, and I deeply apologize for this error. I do, however, have an undergraduate computer science degree with a focus in artificial intelligence from an accredited university.” Capone added that he takes “full responsibility and am making immediate corrections to all official bios, profiles, and any other materials where this incorrect information appears.” Amazingly, Capone’s admission that he had fabricated parts of his résumé was itself false and misleading as it suggested only that his “public biography” was erroneous when in fact Capone had systematically lied about his education time and again to investors, customers, and the public. The next day, on September 15, 2023, DocGo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, announcing Capone’s “resignation.” Though DocGo originated as Ambulnz, with a focus on medical transportation, the Company’s Mobile Health segment grew dramatically through 2020, 2021, and 2022. DocGo reported Mobile Health revenues of $234.4 million in 2021 and $325.9 million in 2022. By the first quarter of 2023, the Mobile Health segment comprised over 69% of the Company’s business. Within DocGo’s Mobile Health segment, the Company had a number of different segments, or “verticals,” including governments, payers, hospitals, and events. DocGo’s government vertical was the Company’s largest by a significant margin. As Capone stated at a March 7, 2023 Cowen Health Care Conference: “Our government vertical is the largest. That’s over 60% of our revenue. And that’s what we call population health. So we go to large municipalities. These are very large contracts when you win them.” The growth in DocGo’s Mobile Health segment and government vertical had been aided by a surge in COVID-19 testing and other services related to COVID-19. For example, during the pandemic, municipalities and municipal healthcare systems such as New York City and NYC Health + Hospitals engaged DocGo to provide COVID-19 testing and vaccinations for the homeless population. With the pandemic winding down in late 2022 and early 2023,"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Mobileye is a technology company that develops and deploys advanced driver-assistance systems (“ADAS”). The Company’s proprietary EyeQ system-on-chip (the “EyeQ”) is a combination of hardware and software which allows car manufacturers to implement ADAS features into their vehicles. While the EyeQ is not Mobileye’s only product, the Company has stated that the EyeQ is “fundamental to [Mobileye’s] leadership position in ADAS” and critical to its financial performance. Mobileye primarily sells the EyeQ chip to “Tier 1” automotive suppliers, who function essentially as intermediaries between Mobileye (i.e., a “Tier 2” supplier) and car manufacturers (known as Original Equipment Manufacturers or “OEMs”), which include companies such as Ford or Volkswagen. The Company’s revenue was concentrated and relied significantly on a handful of Tier 1 customers, including Aptiv PLC, Magna International, Valeo, and ZF Group. The overwhelming majority of Mobileye’s revenue comes from these Tier 1 customers: in both 2022 and 2023, ZF Group, Valeo, and Aptiv were Mobileye’s three biggest customers and generated approximately 70% of Mobileye’s revenue. The Securities Act Defendants at all times received regular reports about inventory and demand from the Company’s customers because, over decades, participants throughout the automotive supply chain (including suppliers like Mobileye and its Tier 1 customers, as well as the OEM manufacturers) have developed and implemented standards and practices to coordinate and streamline the distribution of components needed to manufacture automobiles. These supply chain management practices typically include the electronic exchange of information, including inventory levels and forecasted demand data between suppliers, in order to optimize inventory levels commensurate with manufacturing demand. Tier 1 customers typically place orders using Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) systems, a specialized electronic industry platform that replaced paper-based documents for purchase orders or invoices and allows for instant electronic communication up and down the supply chain. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the accompanying supply chain shortages caused participants to further focus on the importance of managing inventory levels across the supply chain. While there are several different processes used in supply chain management across the automotive industry, these systems all share key features, including that information concerning inventory levels and demand forecasts be exchanged frequently. ZF Group. Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customer, ZF Group, publicly provides a “Global Logistics Directive,” which applies to “all production materials and the associated spare parts purchased by the locations of ZF Group worldwide,” as well as “to all suppliers providing those production materials and associated spare parts to ZF.” Under this directive, ZF expressly adopts for use with suppliers different standards for communication regarding inventory and demand levels. As the Global Logistics Directive makes clear, “The overall obligation of ZF’s suppliers is to secure the delivery of ZF. This requires supplier to make a regular comparison between the MRP [material requirement planning] data from ZF and supplier’s available short-, mid- and long-term capacities . . . Supplier shall take also such additional demand data into consideration for its capacity planning.” Under each standard, described as “call-off procedures,” the supplier is given detailed information regarding ZF’s demand needs. Valeo. Another of Mobileye’s three largest Tier 1 customers, Valeo, states in its publicly available materials that it implements EDI communications to regularly report inventory and demand information to its suppliers. For example, under the publicly-available Valeo Supply Agreement Schedule that Valeo used in the ordinary course during the Class Period with its Tier suppliers (such as Mobileye), Valeo each week provides its Tier 2 suppliers with materials requirement forecasts for the following two months, at minimum. Aptiv. Another of Mobileye’s top Tier 1 customers, Aptiv, stated in its “Customer Specific Requirements” effective June 20, 2022—which applied to “Suppliers that provide direct products or materials for Aptiv,” (such as Mobileye)—that the supplier needs to be certified “as a capable and compliant EDI trading partner,” meaning, use the industry standard EDI protocol. The requirements further indicate that Aptiv provided information to suppliers as to expected production scheduling for the next 2-4 weeks, as well as information beyond four weeks “for planning purposes.” FE 1, an Aptiv former employee, corroborated that Aptiv used EDI with Mobileye, including specifically to provide Mobileye with both (i) 18-month forecasts, which projected demand over the long-term, and (ii) firm orders every two weeks, ensuring that Mobileye knew Aptiv’s immediate demand for the EyeQ chip throughout the Class Period. Magna. Finally, as to Magna—another of Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customers— Mobileye had in July 2014 attached to its public Form F-1 filed with the SEC a purchase schedule between the Company and Magna, which expressly stated that Magna would on a regular basis provide Mobileye with a “items identified as ‘FORECAST’ on a Purchase Schedule [that] are for planning purposes,” thus indicating Mobileye and Magna complied with industry-standard communications around inventory and demand. Magna’s insistence on these practices is further corroborated by Magna’s publicly-available “Magna Global Supply Chain Requirements” manual, dated March 30, 2017, which was “applicable to all suppliers providing materials, products and services to any Magna manufacturing facility.” That manual sets forth specific requirements that forecasting information be sent “to the suppliers through their regularly scheduled releases.” Moreover, Magna is a member of AIAG, the automotive trade association described above that sets forth industry standards, and practices to execute on those standards, to provide regular exchange of inventory and demand. In all respects, the fact that all of Mobileye’s customers regularly communicated with Mobileye regarding their inventory levels and current demand is corroborated by, among other things, Mobileye’s own statements throughout the Class Period, which touted their “continuous contact with customers.” Moreover, this is also confirmed by FE 2, who explained that all of Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers provided reports to Mobileye, which among other things, would update Mobileye on a change in the needs of the Tier 1 customers. These reports, FE 2 explained, were received by Mobileye’s entire commercial team. Mobileye’s EyeQ Revenue, Volumes, And Customers As the Company’s primary driver of revenue, the Offering Documents discussed the Company’s EyeQ chips at length, stating to investors that the Company had sold approximately 62 million EyeQ chips during 2021 and 2022 (the two years before the Offering). The Offering Documents further indicated a 20% increase in sales volumes from 2021 to 2022, conveying the demand growth for the EyeQ chip, and discussed the nature of these sales from Mobileye’s participation in the automotive supply chain and relationships with its Tier 1 customers. Among other things, the Offering Documents stated that Mobileye “generally d[id] not have contracts with customers that require them to purchase our solutions in any certain quantity,” though they had “been working with our customers to ensure they commit to certain volumes,” and that some of the Company’s customers had agreed to purchase “minimum quantities” of “certain solutions” in 2023 as a result of “global shortages.” The Offering Documents did not clearly disclose how many of the customers had entered these commitments, which of Mobileye’s “solutions” were involved, or the volume or value of the quantities at issue. Significantly, the Offering Documents specifically stated that the Company had no commitment on its side to ship any set quantity of its product to the Tier 1 customers, and further assured investors that Mobileye would ship volumes only “depend[ing] upon market conditions.” These disclosures communicated to investors that the volumes shipped by Mobileye had—and would continue to—correspond to market conditions. Given these assurances, the Offering Documents did not give investors the impression that Mobileye faced any material risk from its customers accruing excess inventory. To the contrary, in a June 5, 2023 report issued concerning the Offering, investment analysts at Wells Fargo stated that a risk to Mobileye was the opposite—that “[t]he company has had past issues securing adequate supply to meet demand.” Analysts and the mainstream media continued for months after the Offering to reiterate Mobileye’s growth without any indication they perceived any risk from the quantities that the Company had shipped and committed to ship to its customers. For example, on January 3, 2024, CNBC published an article describing Mobileye as “the stock that’ll be the ‘last man standing’ in autonomous driving,” which quoted and referred extensively to several securities analysts (including Deutsche Bank and RBC Capital) who were anticipating significant upside for the value of Mobileye and its stock. Neither the CNBC article nor any of the analysts it referenced gave any indication of awareness—much less concern—that Mobileye’s shipments had for years exceeded demand, or of the risks to its valuable “long-term growth prospects” from shipping volumes beyond market conditions. In reality—and contrary to the Offering Documents—Mobileye had for the last several years entered into minimum quantity commitments with customers that comprised at least 70% of Mobileye’s revenue, including its top three Tier 1 customers. As the Securities Act Defendants later acknowledged, these obligations made it “impossible” for Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers “to adjust purchases to demand.” These minimum commitment deals resulted in significant inventory buildups at Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers. Moreover, based on these contracts, and contrary to the assurances in the Offering Documents, Mobileye did not ship volumes based on “market conditions,” and had not done so for the past several years. Rather, Mobileye had sold millions of EyeQ chips in excess of market demand. As the Securities Act Defendants later admitted, approximately 4-5 million of the 62 million EyeQ chips shipped in 2021-2022—approximately 6-8% of the Company’s shipped volume for those two years—were in excess of true demand for those chips and simply built up at Mobileye’s customers. Further, because these practices were still continuing at the time of the Offering (though not disclosed in the Offering Documents), Mobileye shipped that year another ~2-3 million more EyeQ chips beyond market demand, comprising ~5-8% of the volume shipped by Mobileye that year. For example, Aptiv, one of Mobileye’s three largest customers, had by the time of the Offering already accumulated large volumes of excess inventory. FE 1, who worked at Aptiv, one of Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customers, explained how the minimum commitment deals between Mobileye and Aptiv operated. According to FE 1, because there was no alternative for the EyeQ chip, there was “no other way” for Aptiv to ensure its access to the EyeQ chips it needed other than agreeing to the minimum commitment agreements demanded by Mobileye, and Mobileye could do whatever it wanted. The contracts did not allow Aptiv to adjust the quantity of chips purchased under the agreement, even as end demand from car manufacturers decreased. FE explained that Aptiv did not really like to have these agreements because then they lose flexibility with cancelling and following up with customers’ demands. FE 1 also explained that Aptiv could not cancel any orders it made pursuant to the minimum commitment contracts. This meant that Aptiv ultimately had to accept more EyeQ chips than it wanted or needed. FE 1 confirmed that even if Aptiv showed Mobileye that business was going down and that the OEMs (Aptiv’s direct customers) were placing fewer orders, Mobileye would not allow Aptiv to adjust the volumes of its orders. According to FE 1, Aptiv wanted to cancel orders because it did not want to build up excess inventory of the EyeQ chips, but Mobileye “forced us to make overstock” because Mobileye would not allow any cancellations. While Aptiv would postpone orders in the short- term, it was obligated to accept the full sum of EyeQ chips agreed to under the minimum commitment contract before the end of the year. FE 1 explained that if Aptiv did not affirmatively order enough EyeQ chips to meet its minimum commitment requirement, Mobileye would simply deliver the remaining chips, “without question,” in November or December. Indeed, consistent with FE 1’s account, Mobileye’s EyeQ sales volumes spiked dramatically at the ends of 2022 and 2023. Specifically, Q4 2022 volumes were 18.2% higher than Q3 2022 volumes, and Q4 2023 volumes were 23.4% higher than Q3 2023 volumes. This directly contradicted the assurances in the Offering Documents that Mobileye would only ship inventory based on “market conditions” and the misimpression that the Company’s revenue growth was tethered to growing demand and Mobileye’s market dominance. The impact from having shipped millions more EyeQ units beyond demand for years reversed years of revenue growth. A senior Mobileye former employee in a key position further confirmed that the Defendants had knowingly shipped excess inventory before the Offering. FE 2 was Mobileye’s Vice President of ADAS Business Development from September 2020 until the end of 2022, when she left the Company. FE 2 reported to Mobileye’s Executive Vice President, Eres Dagan, who in turn reported directly to Defendant Shashua. In her role as VP of ADAS Business Development, FE 2 was responsible for winning ADAS business from both OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. FE 2 confirmed that the excess inventory at Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers existed “across the board” during her tenure, and that the inventory buildup was already “significant” when she left the Company at the end of 2022. FE 2 explained that she learned of the excess inventory because the team that she oversaw received reports from the Tier 1 suppliers. FE 2 explained that during the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the OEMs that Mobileye worked with reduced the number of units that they wanted to acquire. Despite this development, Mobileye told the Tier 1 suppliers that they still had to buy the amount of product that they had previously committed to, and that they should just keep it and store it for the future. FE 2 explained that these conversations with Tier 1 suppliers were already happening when she left the Company at the end of 2022. Members of FE 2’s team were responsible for leading the discussions with the Tier 1 customers and reported to FE 2. FE 2 explained that Dagan (who reported directly to the c-Suite) told her that the conversations with the Tier 1 suppliers should be handled in that manner. FE 2 stated directly that Securities Act Defendant Shashua was aware of the excess inventory, stating that the decision to push inventory to the Tier 1 customers “went up to Amnon” (Defendant Shashua). FE 2’s team would report to her that those conversations with the Tier 1 suppliers took place, and FE 2 would report to more senior executives if something was not as planned. FE 2’s team was told that they needed to ensure that Tier 1 customers purchased the amount of product they had previously committed to. Thus, Mobileye told the Tier 1s that they cannot not buy those amounts. FE 2 explained that usually, however, those conversations (which FE 2 confirmed were happening before she left the Company, i.e., during 2022) with the Tier 1 suppliers did not go well because the Tier 1 suppliers were not very satisfied with Mobileye’s requests for them to take on the volume. FE 2 recalled escalating instances to her supervisor (who reported directly to the c-Suite) in which Tier 1 suppliers did not want to buy the same amount of volume. However, as noted above, FE 2 explained that Mobileye told the customers that they had to buy the amount of product that they had previously committed to, and that they should just keep it and store it for the future. Thus, FE 2 also confirmed that Securities Act Defendant Heller would have been aware of the excess inventory. Specifically, FE 2 explained that each Tier 1 supplier would update Mobileye if there was a change in their needs for product. FE 2 stated that there were quarterly meetings that executive management, including Mobileye’s CFO (at the time, Defendant Heller) would attend. During these meetings, FE 2 explained, anything out of the ordinary at the Company would be discussed, which could include the Tier 1 customers or the reports from the Tier 1 customers when there were issues or things were not going as planned. FE 2 explained that the excess inventory was, in part, obvious to her because OEMs were reducing their orders and Tier 1 suppliers were still being encouraged to order the same amount of product. FE 1 confirmed that Aptiv, one of Mobileye’s biggest Tier 1 customers, regularly provided Mobileye with information concerning its demand and forecast. FE 1’s account corroborates that Defendants—who knew at all times the volumes it shipped to Aptiv and the other Tier 1s—knew about the growing excess inventory at Aptiv. FE 1 explained that Aptiv provided Mobileye with firm orders for the following two weeks along with 18-month forecasts, showing that the demand for EyeQ chips was far below the volume that Mobileye was forcing Aptiv to purchase. Because of these routine forecasts that were provided to Mobileye as part of standard industry practices, FE 1 explained, Mobileye would have known that it was pushing more inventory than its Tier 1 customers could sell to OEMs. Investors in the Offering did not know the truth about these practices or the risks they created. The market’s unawareness is evidenced by, among other things, the stunned reactions from analysts in response to the Company’s surprise revelations in January 2024 (months after the Offering) that (i) it had shipped 6-7 million EyeQ chips in excess of its customers’ underlying demand over the past several years, including 4-5 million excess EyeQ units in 2021-2022 (before the Offering), and (ii) it had required its customers to “make full-year commitment[s]” in 2022 and 2023 that had given those customers “less ability from their side to adjust purchases to demand as they did pre-COVID period” and that made it “impossible” for Mobileye’s customers to “adjust[] the quantities” to match market conditions because they were “obligated with commitments” to Mobileye. For example, analysts at Deutsche Bank immediately noted in response to these disclosures that Defendants had provided “no advance notice of any building inventory issues,” and recognized that this excess inventory revealed that Mobileye’s revenue had for years been “inflated compared with real demand.” As another example confirming that the market had not previously known the full scope and risks around the Company’s shipments beyond market conditions, numerous other analysts reduced their 2024 earnings estimates for Mobileye by approximately 25% immediately after Mobileye revealed the excess inventory for the first time.

      "summary": "American is “one of the United States’ three largest providers of air transportation for passengers and cargo.” Prior to the Class Period, American sold airfare and ancillary services to corporate customers through third-party distributors who used global distribution systems (“GDSs”) that relied on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (“EDIFACT”) to exchange information regarding airfare and ancillary services between travel agencies and airlines. This method for distributing airfare and ancillary services is referred to as “EDIFACT channels.” Beginning in December 2022 and continuing through Spring of 2024, American made a series of changes to the way it sold airfare and ancillary services to its corporate customers. The Company’s new distribution strategy, coined “Modern Retailing,” aimed to push corporate customers away from booking through EDIFACT channels to booking directly through American’s website, mobile app, or a direct connection with the airline, all of which involved using New Distribution Capability (“NDC”) technology. In theory, changing ticket distribution to an NDC standard could reduce costs paid to GDSs and travel agencies while providing American with more control of the price and presentation of its airfare to its customers. To induce customers to shift to NDC and direct bookings, in April 2023, American removed forty percent of its airfare content from EDIFACT channels and restricted its availability to the Company’s direct and NDC channels. American also implemented changes to booking agreements with travel agencies and corporations who were booking their own travel (either through an in-house corporate travel department, a travel management company (“TMC”), or a travel agency) by reducing the number of incentives those customers previously received for buying American services through EDIFACT channels, in favor of awarding incentives tied to bookings made directly with American or through NDC-enabled channels. Plaintiffs allege that from July 2023 through April 2024, Defendants touted the success of their changes to American’s distribution strategy, and issued false earnings guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2024 (“2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance”) that reflected the supposed financial success of their new distribution strategy. Defendants also falsely claimed that they were very encouraged both by third parties’ response to distribution changes and adoption of NDC technology, as well as by corporate customers’ continued demand. For example, speaking of corporate customers, Defendant Raja positively touted “the durability of these customers’ demand” and Defendant Isom stated that “[t]here’s nothing that I see in terms of customer behavior that would suggest that we’re not on the right path.” Defendants continued to echo these claims throughout the Class Period. However, contrary to their public representations, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had no basis for their portrayal of the results from their new distribution strategy, or for their 2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance because American’s distribution strategy changes were driving travel agencies and corporate customers away in droves, and American’s share of business among airlines as a whole was withering. Plaintiffs allege that confidential witnesses (“CWs”) who were employed by American during the Class Period recounted that American’s relationships with both travel agencies and corporate customers quickly deteriorated after the Company began introducing its distribution changes. For instance, by April 2023, before the Class Period even began, it was clear to CW2 that, as a result of American’s aggressive push towards NDC distribution, agencies and companies were booking fewer flights with American than they had in the past, with some avoiding American entirely. Similarly, CW1 personally “saw share move away swiftly” by TMCs, which predominately cater to business and corporate travelers. This reduction in share became “particularly noticeable” to CW1 in June 2023 and continued thereafter. Similarly, CW1 confirmed that American “lost so much share” of small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) since many were unwilling to stop using agencies. Critically, Plaintiffs allege that, based on data available to them through American’s SalesLink Insights platform, PRISM reports, and from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), Defendants knew that customers were not adopting NDC technology and instead, American was losing market share to competitors. As CW2 explained, by July 2023 bookings from larger agencies declined 15% compared to year-over-year levels, and bookings for corporate accounts were “much lower” than that. CW2 elaborated that PRISM data demonstrated that American’s agency and corporate bookings and percentage of share metrics remained “consistently down” through the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January 2024. Moreover, after the Class Period, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants admitted to having known that American’s lagging revenue and “softness in customer bookings” were a direct result of “changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that American knew that these issues existed during the first quarter of 2024 but nevertheless obscured the severity of impacts in hopes that the results would reverse, stating in relevant part: “[W]e identified a deviation in terms of our revenue performance versus some of our large network peers in the first quarter” of 2024. Despite knowing about these materially negative effects of the new strategy on their business, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants continued to knowingly misrepresent American’s sales success throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. Indeed, as late as April 25, 2024 (one month before quarter close), the Individual Defendants were asked point blank during an earnings call to describe American’s performance with “managed corporate travel volume” in relation to competitors who reported market share around “14%, 15%.” Defendants did not demur. Rather, Defendant Raja clearly lied, stating, in pertinent part, and in contradiction to information known “in the first quarter,” that such “revenues are coming back very materially for us” including with regard to “corporate contract and corporate customers[.]” At the same time Defendants issued knowingly false financial guidance and, referring to American’s supposedly positive performance with NDC deployment, stated “that’s implicit in our [falsely high] guide for Q2 and for the year.” Just one month later, on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants disclosed the truth when reporting that Defendant Raja would be leaving the Company in June 2024 and that American was significantly reducing its guidance for the second quarter of 2024. During the Bernstein Conference on May 29, 2024, Defendant Isom confirmed that American was reducing its second quarter guidance and revealed that the Company was slashing its growth estimates for the full year 2024 “due to the changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that, with respect to NDC implementation, American “move[d] faster than we should and we didn’t execute well[,]” “used a lot of sticks[,]” and that its “approach [was and] is driving customers away from American.” During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, Defendant Isom also linked Raja’s departure to American driving customers away with the changes to its agency and corporate strategy. Upon this news, American’s stock dropped dramatically, falling from a closing price of $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May 29, 2024 and resulting in American’s largest single-day drop since June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic decimated travel demand. As Defendant Isom would later admit during the Company’s July 25, 2024 2Q 2024 Earnings Call American’s guidance reduction was directly related to the Company’s changes to its distribution strategy—not general air travel market factors. Indeed, American’s competitor, United Airlines, reaffirmed its guidance within minutes of American’s May 28, 2024 announcement—ostensibly at the ready for American’s disclosure of the truth. Analysts reacted swiftly. For instance, in a May 28, 2024 report, Bernstein analysts were surprised by the extent of American’s guidance reduction, stating in relevant part: “[a] significant miss driven in part by close in bookings[,]” i.e., bookings that are made close in time to a flight date (frequently used for corporate fliers), which “puts AAL’s ability to reap the full value of a robust summer flying season in greater doubt” and further attributed the “close in booking weakness … to loss of corporate travel share associated with recent distribution strategy changes (positive read across to DAL/UAL[Delta/United]).” Barclays wrote in a report published on May 30, 2024 that “a relevant contributor to the revenue weakness[]” was American’s NDC strategy during the Class Period, noting that American was now “abandoning its ‘modern retailing approach’ and that the CCO has left.” Barclays further observed “[n]o other airline has followed this path[,]” that “American’s revenue guidance was very out of kilter with peers,” and that “the issue was [American’s] guidance not the reality of the travel market.” Moreover, after the Class Period on July 25, 2024, Defendant Isom disclosed the full impact of American’s disastrous distribution strategy when reporting American’s operating results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. There, Defendant Isom disclosed that, as a result of the Company’s distribution strategy changes, American lost $750 million in revenue during the first half of 2024, and was expected to experience another $750 million impact to revenue for the second half of 2024. Isom further admitted that American had ceded market share from agencies and corporate customers to its competitors during the Class Period and stated that, in an effort to regain that share, American was reversing the changes to its distribution strategy. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ fraud caused investors to purchase American securities at artificially inflated prices and suffer immense financial harm thereby. Plaintiffs assert two claims for relief against Defendants. First, Plaintiffs assert a claim for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all Defendants. Second, Plaintiffs assert a claim for violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).",
