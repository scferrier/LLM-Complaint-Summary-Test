      "summary": "Carvana, a self-described e-commerce company dealing in used cars, was founded by Ernest Garcia II (“Garcia Senior”) and his son Ernest Garcia III (“Garcia Junior”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garcia Senior’s other used car business, DriveTime Automotive (“DriveTime”). After going public, Defendants continued to tout their “bigger is better” growth story. Immediately before the Class Period, however, Defendants faced a dilemma as investors were concerned that Carvana’s retail sales growth was slowing. As a Morgan Stanley analyst noted on February 27, 2020, if Carvana’s “growth starts to slow significantly, and the company is still not profitable, there will be a transition away from growth investors, and . . . how investors think about the valuation of the stock will change.” Defendants could not let this happen; they needed the Company to have a high valuation so they could cash out their personal holdings in Carvana stock at a top dollar. Thus, Defendants planned and executed a scheme to inflate the Company’s retail vehicle sales while concealing the unsustainability of Carvana’s model and the many devastating consequences of their scheme. Weeks before the start of the Class Period, Defendant Garcia Senior partnered with his son to orchestrate a direct offering that allowed Garcia Senior to purchase stock pre-Class Period at a depressed price that he would later sell at inflated prices during the Class Period. As the Class Period began, Defendants embarked on their scheme to inflate Carvana’s retail sales, and thus, Carvana’s stock price. While Defendants disclosed the Company’s focus on retail sales growth, Defendants concealed that it required a series of unsustainable machinations to accelerate this growth, including: (i) “frequently aquir[ing] sales that were less profitable”; (ii) abruptly escalating the number of cars purchased from customers to induce trade-ins by lowering the Company’s purchasing and verification standards, and buying “as much as was humanly possible”; (iii) launching a rapid and unsustainable nationwide expansion plan to enter over 150 new markets even though the Company lacked the necessary infrastructure to serve many of these markets; (iv) violating state title and registration laws to quickly push through sales; and (v) entering into a pass-through sales arrangement with the Garcias’ DriveTime to sell thousands of cars with no benefit to Carvana except for the boost to its reported unit sales. At the same time that Defendants inflated Carvana’s retail unit growth, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business. Specifically, Defendants exalted Carvana’s increases in retail sales and masked its actual gross profits per retail unit, while touting the efficiencies and capabilities of its groundbreaking logistics network and “capital-light” expansion model. Defendants’ assurances were aimed at convincing investors that Carvana’s growth was sustainable. After all, if Carvana could pair its explosive unit growth with purported profitability, and a scalable logistics model that could expand across the country efficiently and cost effectively, the sky was the limit. Defendants’ limitless growth story produced its desired results. Carvana’s retail sales growth skyrocketed, propelling Carvana to be named as one of the fastest companies to ever make the Fortune 500 list based on organic growth alone, along with Google and Amazon. Naturally, Carvana’s stock price soared, rising as high as $376 per share during the Class Period. And Defendants took full advantage of the artificially inflated stock price by dumping more than $3.87 billion of their personally held shares on unsuspecting investors. Garcia Senior alone reaped more than $3.6 billion in insider sales proceeds. Daniel Taylor, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of Business and director of the Wharton Forensic Analytics Lab, explained to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal that Garcia Senior’s insider trades were nefarious, concluding: “What I’m saying is the Garcias knew it was short-lived[.] . . . The Garcias knew the music would eventually end.” And the music did end – with a thud. Through a series of partial disclosures, investors began to learn that Carvana was a very different company from the one they were sold. Defendants’ “bigger is better” Amazon-comparison story was a fiction. Ultimately, Defendants admitted that Carvana’s retail sales growth was unsustainable – indeed, by the end of the Class Period, retail sales were significantly declining. Defendants acknowledged that Carvana’s “capital-light” market expansion model was a farce, and Carvana was forced to issue billions of dollars of high-interest junk bonds to acquire a nationwide auction house, ADESA, to backfill its deficient infrastructure. By the time the truth about Carvana’s growth, profitability, and business model was revealed, the price of Carvana’s Class A common stock had plummeted from a Class Period high of $376 per share to $7.39 per share, representing a decline of more than 97%, leaving the Company on the verge of bankruptcy. While investors suffered billions of dollars in damages, Defendants’ fraudulent conduct permitted them to walk away with billions of dollars. Plaintiffs seek to recover those damages on behalf of the putative Class through this action.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems. Its stock is listed on the NASDAQ. Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 and became Chief Executive Officer and spokesman in 2008. Musk also serves as Chairman of the Board and is Tesla’s majority shareholder. Musk created a Twitter profile in 2009 and often used Twitter to communicate about Tesla’s business. In November 2013, Tesla notified investors that it would use Musk’s Twitter account as a formal means of communication to convey “additional information” about the company to investors. Throughout the Class Period, there were over 170 million shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding and hundreds of millions of dollars of other securities traded. Upon information and belief, these shares and option contracts were held by thousands of individuals located geographically throughout the country and the world. Lead Plaintiff Glen Littleton purchased and sold Tesla common stock and options during the Class Period and was damaged thereby. Littleton’s certification evidencing his transactions in Tesla’s securities during the Class Period, previously filed with the Court in connection with his motion for appointment as lead plaintiff, is incorporated herein by reference. Defendants Brad W. Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio J. Gracias, James Murdoch, Kimbal Musk, and Linda Johnson Rice are and were members of Tesla’s Board of Directors. These defendants are collectively referred to as the “Board.” Tesla has experienced production difficulties after introducing three types of electric vehicles. As the Model 3 vehicle was to be produced in greater numbers, analysts and investors closely followed Tesla’s production plans for it. On October 2, 2017, Tesla issued a press release stating that “Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.” Despite promising to deliver 1,600 Model vehicles in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it had produced only 220 of the vehicles. Musk had previously promised on February 22, 2017 that Tesla would be producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017. On November 1, 2017, in an “Update Letter” posted to its website, Tesla revealed that its manufacturing problems during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 had resulted in heavy spending in an effort to increase production. The spending resulted in wider-than-expected losses— $2.92 per share compared to the analyst consensus of $2.29 per share—and a sharp decline in the price of Tesla’s common stock from $331.53 per share to $321.08 per share. Notwithstanding its production problems, Tesla told shareholders in the November 1, 2017 “Update Letter” that it expected to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week late in the first quarter of 2018. On January 3, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that Tesla’s problems with battery production at its “Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada (where Tesla produces lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles), were worse than it had acknowledged and likely to cause further delays and quality issues for the new Model 3 vehicles. The continued production problems led Tesla to revise its previously stated production targets in a press release dated January 3, 2018. From 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Tesla told investors that it was aiming for 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of March, ramping up to 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by June. On January 25, 2018, investors received additional information about Tesla’s Model production problems when CNBC reported that Tesla’s Model 3 vehicle production was being hampered in part due to the fact that the company was still making its Model 3 vehicle batteries partly by hand and having to “borrow” scores of employees from Panasonic, which is a partner in the Gigafactory and supplies lithium-ion battery cells, to help with this manual assembly. Numerous short investors had targeted Tesla by this point in time. For example, CNBC reported in its January 25, 2018 article that Stanphyl Capital’s Mark B. Spiegel had taken a “significant short position in the company.” Spiegel told CNBC, in pertinent part, that: “While I’ve no doubt that Tesla will eventually work out its Model 3 vehicle production problems, the base model will cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build. The company will never deliver more than a token few for less than the current $49,000 lowest-cost offering. Sales will hugely disappoint relative to expectations of over 400,000 a year. And even at those higher prices Tesla will never come anywhere close to its promised [profitability].” As of January 31, 2018, the short interest in Tesla stock was approximately 30 million shares, or about 18% of Tesla’s outstanding shares. On April 3, 2018, Tesla revealed in a press release that instead of producing 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week, it was only producing just over 2,000. According to the Wall Street Journal in an article published on April 3, 2018, Musk had developed a reputation for setting “ambitious deadlines that he fail[ed] to meet on time.” As of April 3, 2018, Tesla’s short interest had grown to almost 32 million shares, or 19% of the company’s outstanding shares. On April 11, 2018, according to an article published by CNBC titled Tesla is the biggest short in the US stock market, the dollar amount of shares shorted on Tesla was $10.7 billion, or more than 25% of Tesla’s available stock. Big banks, such as Goldman Sachs, were encouraging its clients to sell their Tesla stock on the premise that the company would not be able to meet its Model 3 vehicle production targets. Musk publicly displayed his animosity towards short sellers of Tesla stock. On May 2, 2018, while participating in a conference call to discuss Tesla’s earnings for the first quarter of 2018, Musk abruptly dismissed questions from analysts. In response to a question from Sanford Bernstein senior analyst Toni Sacconaghi about Tesla’s capital requirements, Musk responded by saying “Boring, bonehead questions are not cool, Next?” In response to a question from RBC Capital Markets Joseph Spak about Model 3 vehicle reservations, Musk said, “These questions are so dry. They’re killing me.” On May 4, 2018, Musk defended his hostile behavior towards Sacconaghi and Spak, tweeting that they were just “two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis.” Later on May 4, 2018, Musk tweeted “Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.” Shortly afterwards on May 4, 2018, Musk stated, “Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit . . . .” On May 7, 2018, Musk bought about $9.85 million worth of Tesla shares in the pre-market in a manner designed have the greatest impact on Tesla’s stock price and force a burst of short-covering. On May 7, 2018, Tesla’s stock price increased from $297.50 to $302.77. Musk did this again on June 12, 2018 when he bought about $24.9 million worth of Tesla stock to maintain Tesla’s stock price despite announcing that Tesla was cutting 46,000 employees, about 9% of its workforce. On June 17, 2018, Musk tweeted that “[the shorts] have about three weeks before their short position explodes.” On July 2, 2018 and July 3, 2018, The New York Times and Bloomberg reported that Tesla finally met its production target of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week during the last seven days of June 2018. Despite Tesla’s increased Model 3 vehicle production figures, its stock price fell from $342.95 on June 29, 2018 to $310.86 on July 3, 2018. Tesla’s short interest, however, also fell by 11% from 39 million shares to 34.6 million shares. On July 22, 2018, the Wall Street Journal published a story focused on Tesla’s request to suppliers to refund a portion of its past payments. According to this report, Tesla requested its suppliers to refund “a meaningful amount of its payments since 2016” to allow it to continue its operations and continue “the long-term growth between” Tesla and its suppliers. Tesla’s requests for refunds from its suppliers raised further questions about its cash position, which had dwindled due to Model 3 vehicle production issues. Following the July 22, 2018 Wall Street Journal article, Tesla’s stock price declined from $313.58 per share to $303.20 per share. On July 24, 2018, in response to a growing short interest following the Wall Street Journal article, Musk contacted the employer of an author of an article published on SeekingAlpha and threatened to sue or complain publicly about the articles. The author, who managed a private family investment portfolio of approximately $1 billion, had published four articles titled “Just Say ‘No’ To Tesla’s Misleading Margin Metric,” “As Tesla Breaks Faith With Its Believers, It’s Time To Go Short,” “Even With Model 3 Success, Tesla Is Structurally Bankrupt,” and “Tesla Investors Swallow The Blue Pill.” Musk threatened that if the author continued to write, he would engage counsel and sue. As a result of Musk’s threats, the author immediately stopped writing at SeekingAlpha and deactivated his Twitter account. On July 30, 2018, U.S. News & World Report reported that Steve Eisman, the investor who famously predicted the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2007 and 2008 and was featured in Michael Lewis’s book The Big Short, was predicting a similar demise for Tesla. In an interview with Bloomberg, Eisman expressed the opinion that Musk had a hard time executing, despite being a “very, very smart man.” By July 31, 2018, Tesla’s short interest was back to 35 million shares, or 20% of the company’s outstanding stock. On July 31, 2018, Musk and Sam Teller, who was employed by Tesla as Director, Office of the CEO, attended a meeting with representatives of the Public Investment Fund at the “Tesla Factory” in Freemont, California, for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer, joined the meeting about halfway through. On several occasions since January 2017, the Public Investment Fund had expressed interest in exploring with Musk a going-private transaction involving Tesla, but no proposed transaction had resulted from those discussions. During the July 31, 2018 meeting, a representative of the Public Investment Fund mentioned that the fund would still be interested in exploring a going-private transaction if Tesla was prepared to build a production facility in the Middle East. No additional details or terms were discussed, including fundamental terms such as: the dollar amount to be invested; the ownership percentage for the fund if Tesla was to go private; any acquisition premium to be offered to current Tesla shareholders; any potential restrictions on foreign ownership of a significant stake in Tesla; the fund’s available liquid capital to contribute to a going-private transaction; whether the fund was experienced in going-private transactions; regulatory obstacles associated with a going-private transaction; or what, if any, approval from Tesla’s Board was needed to take Tesla private. When the July 31, 2018 meeting concluded, no legal documents had been signed, no term sheets had been executed, no advisors had been engaged, and no decision had been made with regard to the Middle East production facility. On August 1, 2018, Tesla reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2018 in an investor “Update Letter” and during an investor conference call. Tesla’s results exceeded analyst revenue expectations. In the “Update Letter” published on August 1, 2018, Tesla also affirmed production targets of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of August. Tesla’s quarterly results led to a 16% surge in the company’s stock price from $300.84 to $349.54. On August 2, 2018, after the market closed, Musk sent an email to Tesla’s Board, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel. The subject line of the email stated “Offer to Take Tesla Private at $420.” In the email, Musk explained that he wanted to take Tesla private in order to, among other reasons, avoid the “constant defamatory attacks by the short-selling community” against Tesla. Musk also asked that the “matter be put to a shareholder vote at the earliest opportunity” and advised that the “offer expires in 30 days.” At this point in time, Musk thought there was “a lot of uncertainty” regarding a potential going-private transaction and believed that the likelihood of consummating a transaction was about 50%. According to Musk, the $420 per-share price for the going-private transaction was based on a 20% premium to the closing price of Tesla’s stock on August 2, 2018, which was $349.54 per share. Musk believed that 20% was a “standard premium” in going-private transactions. Although the precise calculation equaled $419.49, Musk rounded the price up to $420 per share because he thought his girlfriend at the time, Claire Elise Boucher (also known as “Grimes”), would find it funny due to the significance of the number to marijuana users. Since Musk’s meeting with the Public Investment Fund on July 31, 2018, Tesla’s stock price had increased over 17% due to the positive earnings results announced by the company on August 1, 2018. If Musk were to have applied the 20% premium to Tesla’s stock price as of July 31, 2018 (closing price of $298.14 per share), the per-share price for the going-private transaction would have been approximately $358 per share. Accordingly, if the going-private transaction occurred at $420 per share, investors in the transaction would be paying a “premium on a spike,” which Musk realized could make the going-private transaction not feasible. Notwithstanding, Musk did not discuss the $420 per-share price with the Public Investment Fund or any other funding source for a going-private transaction prior to sending his email to Tesla’s Board on August 2, 2018. On August 3, 2018, in response to Musk’s email, the Board held a telephonic meeting at which time Musk informed the board that the Public Investment Fund was interested in funding a going-private transaction and that the fund was interested in having Tesla build a production facility in the Middle East. Concerning building a production facility in the Middle East, at least one Tesla Board member described such a condition as a “non-starter.” Musk also told the Board that he wanted Tesla’s existing investors to stay with the company. At least one Board member told Musk that it would be “really difficult for small investors” to remain shareholders if Tesla went private. Musk also asked the Board for permission to contact existing shareholders to assess their interest in participating in a going-private transaction. The Board authorized Musk to contact certain investors and report back. On August 6, 2018, Musk discussed the going-private transaction with a private equity fund partner with experience in going-private transactions. During the call, Musk stated that the number of shareholders in a private Tesla would need to be below 300, yet at the time there were over 800 institutional investors in Tesla. The private equity fund partner told Musk that the structure he was contemplating for the private company was “unprecedented” in his experience. On August 7, 2018, while driving to the airport, Musk posted the following tweet at 12:48 p.m. ET: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” At 1:00 p.m. ET, Martin Viecha, Tesla’s Senior Director of Investor Relations, sent a text message to Musk asking, “Was this text legit?” At 1:13 p.m. ET, a Tesla investor texted Teller asking, “What’s Elon’s tweet about? Can’t make any sense of it. Would be incredibly disappointing for shareholders that have stuck it out for so long.” Several minutes later, a reporter also texted Teller saying, “Quite a tweet! (Is it a joke?).” At 1:15 p.m. ET, Musk responded to another Twitter user’s question, “At what price?” by repeating “420.” At 1:40 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted, “I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.” At 2:00 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted, “My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX [a privately held company for which Musk serves as CEO] investment.” In response to this tweet another Twitter user asked, “Could we still invest once private?” Musk responded, “Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX).” At 2:07 p.m. ET, Musk responded to a Twitter user who wrote, “Or if you do take Tesla private, please have a provision for retail investors who have held Tesla shares prior to Dec 31, 2016 that those shares will be converted into private shares in the new private company. . . .” by tweeting, “Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.” At 2:08 p.m. ET, NASDAQ halted trading in Tesla stock due to the increased volatility. Trading remained halted for just over one and a half hours until 3:45 p.m. ET. At 2:13 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted, “Shareholders could either to [sic] at 420 or hold shares & go private.” At 2:23 p.m. ET, a reporter emailed Musk with the subject line reading: “Are you just messing around?” In the email, the reporter said, “Reaching out to see what’s going on with your tweets about taking the company private? Is this just a 420 joke gone awry? Are you serious? It seems like you are dancing into some pretty tricky legal territory by messing about with the markets this way. Is there an actual explanation coming?” At 3:07 p.m. ET, Musk responded to a Twitter user’s comment about a “forced buyout” by tweeting, “Def. no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.” At 3:16 p.m. ET, Musk sent an email to Tesla employees. The content of that email, entitled “Taking Tesla Private,” was published to a publicly available Tesla blog at 3:32 p.m. ET. In the email and blog post, Musk explained his reasons for wanting to take Tesla private, including asserting that TSLA was “the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market” and stating that “being public means there are large numbers of people who have incentive to attack the company.” The complete email and blog post follows: Taking Tesla Private August"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Netflix primarily operates an entertainment streaming platform that offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games across a variety of genres and languages in over 190 countries. It also offers a DVD-by-mail service in the U.S. The Company allowed members to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. During the Class Period, members could play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Netflix was a pioneer in the shift from linear tv to streaming and Hastings expressed very high confidence that [l]inear dissipates over the next 10 to 20 years on the Companys January 20, 2022 Q4'21 earnings call. Netflix has one operating segment. During the Class Period, its revenues were primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to its members. Netflix defines a paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) as having the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. During the Class Period, Netflix provided quarterly guidance for paid net membership additions or paid net adds. Paid net adds was the number of paid new memberships added each quarter minus those it lost due to cancellations, or more simply acquisition minus churn. Netflix did not report specific figures for acquisition and churn, but paid net adds combined the two. Churn was often discussed in terms of its counterpart retention. Netflix also reported on how users engaged with its platform. Engagement was measured by the number of accounts that viewed a title until the end of 2021, when it changed the metric to measure the number of hours viewed per title. Engagement was often discussed as viewing or views. The Company considered acquisition, churn, and engagement important metrics to gauge the health of the business. For example, on the January 19, 2021 Q4'20 earnings call, Neumann noted viewing is up in every region of the world. . . . Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business[.] On the January 19, 2021 Q4'20 earnings call, Neumann explained that Netflix used these metrics to determine when to increase prices, stating, So you think about engagement with the service and retention and churn characteristics, acquisition. Those are the things that were really looking for that are key to basically saying, okay, weve added more value in the service. Now its the right time to go back to those members and ask them to pay a little bit more so that we can reinvest it and keep adding it. Later, at the March 8, 2022 Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Neumann claimed that the business is healthy and noted that engagement [was] up over the prior year and pre-COVID. Retention or churn levels [were] lower than prior year in pre-COVID, and that was everywhere around the world. And so that -- those are the kind of metrics were looking at. In reporting its results, the Company broke down its members into four geographic regions: the Unites States and Canada (UCAN); Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Latin America (LATAM); and Asia-Pacific (APAC). During the Class Period, the Company estimated that its total addressable market (TAM) outside of China was approximately 800 million to 900 million broadband households, and the TAM in the UCAN was estimated to be approximately 125 million broadband households. UCAN was Netflixs most penetrated region where it had captured the largest share of the TAM. During the January 19, 2021 Q4'20 earnings call, Neumann stated that in the UCAN market, were roughly 60% penetrated, and he acknowledged on the October 19, 2021 Q3'21 earnings call that Latin America and UCAN . . . are a bit more mature, more tenured, more penetrated[.] Nevertheless, throughout the Class Period, the Defendants assured that there was a lot of headroom in all of these markets and that in every region, including UCAN, there was ample runway for growth. Growing subscribers outside of UCAN required Netflix to expand its library of local content in those respective markets, which was a longer-term prosect. Hastings reflected on this dynamic on the July 19, 2019 Q2'19 earnings call, stating, Now do we have enough content in each of those countries? Most of that is local content that gets consumed. . . . So well just take it year-by year and try to have our net adds continue to grow. Neumann similarly noted at the March 2, 2020 Morgan Stanley conference its frankly quite early days in these non-U.S. regions in terms of continuing to build that content market for that. Netflixs monthly membership prices varied by country. For example, in 2021 its Basic plan was $1.96 per month in Turkey and $12.86 per month in Switzerland, even though both are within the EMEA. Based on its revenues and paid memberships reported on a regional basis for fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021, Netflixs average revenue per member was $12.91 per month in UCAN, $9.71 per month in EMEA, $7.00 per month in LATAM, and $7.76 per month in APAC. As a result of price increases, in 2021 Netflixs average revenue per member increased to $14.37 per month in UCAN, $10.92 per month in EMEA, $7.46 per month in LATAM, and $8.34 per month in APAC. Given these disparities, where Netflix was acquiring and losing members was critical to its revenue growth. Throughout the Class Period, UCAN was responsible for ~43-45% of Netflixs total quarterly revenue. Netflix defined its competition broadly. Its fiscal 2020 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021 stated, We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. Many of Netflixs main competitors had been streaming content for years, including Hulu since 2007, HBO since 2010, and in 2011 Amazon included video streaming content in the price of its Prime membership. Several major new players entered the streaming market in recent years. In November 2019, Disney Plus began streaming Disneys huge library of content for only $6.99 per month, and for just $12.99 per month, viewers could get the Disney Bundle consisting of Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN. Apple TV also entered the market in November 2019 for only $4.99 per month and was seen as a major competitor due to the companys financial resources and wide distribution network, which included 900 million iPhone users. In July 2020, NBCUniversal launched Peacock, which offered some content for free with ads, and had additional content, including live sports, offered with its Premium package for $4.99 per month with ads and $9.99 per month without ads. In March 2021, ViacomCBS launched Paramount Plus for $4.99 per month with ads and $9.99 per month without ads. While its competitors earned revenue from advertising on their platforms or offered an advertising-free package for an additional cost, Netflix proudly remained free of advertising, and, therefore, its revenue growth depended entirely on continued member acquisition and retention. The Companys July 17, 2019 Letter to Shareholders proclaimed that remaining advertising free was a deep part of our brand proposition and [w]e believe we will have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction. The July 17, 2019 Letter to Shareholders told investors that when you read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. A. Historically, Netflix Claimed That Account Sharing Was Not A Material Inhibitor To Subscriber Acquisition Account sharing, also referred to as password sharing, is when paying members share their password with non-paying users who do not reside in their household. Netflix permitted multiple users within the same household to share a single account. On Netflixs April 22, 2013 Q1'13 earnings call, Hastings explained, We usually like to think that a husband and wife can share an account and that thats perfectly appropriate and acceptable. If you mean, hey, I got my password from my boyfriends uncle then thats not what we would consider appropriate. And so, we focus on serving the immediate family. Historically, Netflixs standard plan allowed members two simultaneous streams. On Netflixs April 22, 2013 earnings call, Hastings discussed a new plan which provided members with four simultaneous streams for $11.99 per month, a 50% increase from its standard plan which was priced at $7.99 per month. Hasting said, we expect . . . fewer than 1% of our members to take that plan. Hastings assured investors that the new plan was designed for people within the same household, noting that we really dont think that theres much going on of the Im going to share my password with a marginal acquaintance. The 4-stream plan was introduced to aid large households, and management acknowledged it would have exacerbate[d] account sharing; however, password sharing was not viewed as a significant problem at the time. At a May 15, 2013 conference hosted by J.P. Morgan, Netflixs then-CFO David Wells (Wells) was asked to reconcile the plans allowing additional streams with the sharing of passwords not being an issue in your mind. Wells replied: Well, we introduced the 4-streaming plan. And it is a very, very small percentage of the base -- we said less than 2% that this would appeal to. And that is based on observations of people actually running into the cap of two simultaneous streams and also calls to our customer service center. So it is a very small percentage of the base. It solves a problem for very large families and households. And with respect and relative to password sharing, honestly, if password sharing were a bigger problem, the 4-stream actually might exacerbate that because then -- now you are allowing even more people to share one common plan. So if we felt like that was a huge problem, it would have factored into the calculus of releasing a 4-stream plan. I dont -- our observation and our view is that password sharing is not quite as large as has been out there, floated out there. When Netflix introduced a $6.99 plan, allowing streaming only on one screen, in December 2013, media speculated that the subscription tier means you might have to say goodbye to sharing accounts your friends and family. But management denied that the $6.99 plan was responsive to account sharing or Netflixs penetration in U.S. On the January 22, 2014 Q4'13 earnings call, Hastings was asked who the $6.99 plan was targeting and if it was reflective of your view in terms of penetration or maturity in the US? Hastings replied, [w]ere testing lots of things. . . . One of the things is the $6.99 one stream, I dont think you should read too much into that other then [sic] were probing around the edges. Theres no definite plan to do that. I would say generally as we put in the letter were trying to figure out some models of good, better, best price tiering that makes sense and provide some flexibility for our customers, at least for our new customers. As reflected in the chart below, Netflix implemented numerous pricing increases for its Basic, Standard, and Premium plans in UCAN over the years. The primary distinction between Netflixs pricing plans was the number of simultaneous streams allowed, allowing anyone with access to the members password to use their account, provided that the account had not reached its maximum number of simultaneous streams. In fact, [w]e love people sharing Netflix and Thats a positive thing, not a negative thing, Hastings told reporters at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 6, Hastings assured these users would eventually become paying members, stating, As kids move on in their life, they like to have control of their life, and as they have an income, we see them separately subscribe. . . . It really hasnt been a problem. CNET published an article discussing Hastings CES comments on January 6, 2016, which acknowledged that the number of simultaneous streams did impose a limit on account sharing: Netflix, of course, does try to curb how widely passwords are shared. A standard account that costs $9.99 a month allows users to watch videos on two screens simultaneously. For an additional $2 a month, you can upgrade to four screens. Account sharing was not a material inhibitor to [Netflixs] growth, according to Wells speaking at the January 6, 2016 Citi Internet, Media, and Telecommunications Conference. He stated: [I]n terms of password protection, we havent been as focused on it as you guys have. That isnt to say that we dont look at it and have a point of view. It is just we dont feel like it is a material inhibitor to our growth. That might not be true forever. But even if we were to identify it and know it for sure when we see it, that is different than turning that person into a paid subscriber. At the same conference, Wells indicated that allowing multiple profiles enabled account sharing, but hoped the quality and low-cost of the service would encourage people to get their own account: And for us, we want to enable the allowed use cases of within household. Certainly having your 35-year-old daughters boyfriend's cousin use Netflix is not in the acceptable use cases. And so, it is a matter of trying to make our recommendations and a recommendation engine in that profile so compelling that for a low-cost service, my god, how cheap are you? Cant you go get your own Netflix? That is the dialogue we would want to have happening in the household. Analysts continued to ask whether the Company would take steps to limit account sharing. The analyst at the September 20, 2016 Goldman Sachs Conference noted that adding individual profiles within a single account -- almost seems to encourage [password sharing] and wondered if Netflix would need to start tightening the noose in terms of things like simultaneous streams[.] Wells contended that there is a hard constraint today in the number of concurrent streams and reiterated predominantly we just focused on making it -- the service doesnt cost that much, so why dont you get your own? Wells also noted We could crack down on it, but you wouldnt suddenly turn all those folks to paid users. Hastings again dismissed concerns about account sharing on an October 17, 2016 Q3'16 earnings call, stating No plans on making any changes there. Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because theres so much legitimate password sharing like, you know, you sharing with your spouse, with your kids, so theres no bright line and were doing fine as is. Similarly, on Netflixs October 16, 2017 Q3'17 earnings call, an analyst noted the question I get asked a lot is whether password-sharing is an issue and asked if price increases reflected that Netflix was making password sharing more expensive? Peters denied this was the case stating, password sharing isnt a huge issue for us right now. Its not a huge priority to go try and take significant measure to try and stem it. We think that a broader spread in pricing better reflects the value that were delivering in the higher tiers[.] Underscoring the investing publics interest in account sharing and its impact on subscriber growth, market observers often estimated the amount of account sharing and the associated lost revenue. An August 19, 2018 CNBC article noted: An estimated 35 percent of millennials share passwords for streaming services. Thats compared with 19 percent of Generation X subscribers and 13 percent of Baby Boomers. Media experts struggle to pinpoint an exact cost, and Netflix and HBO executives have gone on record to dispel concerns. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in 2016 password sharing hasnt been a problem and could convince new users to buy in. A January 15, 2019 Yahoo Finance article discussing a survey conducted by cordcutting.com which asked 1,127 U.S. based people aged 18 to 81 about their streaming usage and estimated that 24 million people who used Netflix did not pay for it. The article stated, Freeloading off other people deprives Netflix (NFLX) of at least $2.3 billion in revenue each year[.] B. In Late 2019, Netflix Admitted It Monitors Account Sharing On January 9, 2019, Cybersecurity Insiders published an online article reporting that In order to curb such [password sharing] practices and safeguard revenues, Netflix has decided to use Synamedias Credential Sharing behavioral analytics and machine learning software to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services. The article stated: Currently, the system is under trial on more than 5,650 Netflix users and based on its success rate, it will be rolled out onto the entire user base by March this year. Synamedia, the largest independent video software provider, offered its Credentials Sharing Insight product, which was designed to help streaming service providers combat the rapid rise in account sharing between friends and families and turn it into a new revenue-generating opportunity. The product was thought to have the ability to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate password sharing. According to the January 9, 2019 article, Synamedias product was capable of viewing habits and location habits of a user to identify when non-paying viewers log into an account. It can detect whether a user is viewing at their main home or a holiday home. It could also detect if a subscriber has grown-up children who live away from home so streaming services wont punish the wrong people for account sharing. While Netflix did not publicly acknowledge that it was using Synamedias product, Netflix management did admit to monitoring account sharing. On the Companys October 16, 2019 Q3'19 earnings call, an analyst asked whether a more mature growth trajectory in the U.S. makes it important for [Netflix] to address password sharing. Peters replied we continue to monitor it, so were looking at the situation. Well see, again, those consumer-friendly ways to push on the edges of that. But I think weve got no big plans to announce at this point in time in terms of doing something differently there. Prior to the end of the Class Period, Netflix did not publicly disclose the extent of account sharing, and analysts estimates of account sharing varied significantly. A July 2019 research note by MoffettNathanson indicated that about 14% of Netflix users report they are using a password from someone outside of my household.

      "summary": "Lucid designs, produces, and sells luxury electric vehicles. In 2016, the company unveiled a prototype for its first vehicle—a luxury electric sedan called the Lucid Air. That same year, Lucid announced plans to build a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and said it would begin producing the Air by 2018. But Lucid struggled to raise money as a private company, leading it to repeatedly delay the start of production. In 2018, Lucid entered into a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), to raise an additional $1 billion. Despite this infusion, by the beginning of 2021, Lucid still had not commenced commercial production of the Air and was again running low on cash. As a result, Lucid decided to seek funding from a new source—investors on the public market. On February 22, 2021, Lucid announced plans to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV (“Churchill”) in order to bring the company public through a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) transaction (the “Merger”). At the time, the Merger was the largest proposed SPAC transaction in history, and would provide Lucid with $4.4 billion in cash. As the Merger approached, Lucid knew that investors were focused on whether it would finally be able to ramp up production of the Air after years of delay. In a February 22, 2021 investor presentation announcing the Merger, Lucid told investors that the company would produce 20,000 vehicles by the end of 2022, thus garnering more than $2 billion in 2022 revenues. Lucid continued to drive investor interest by reiterating its 2022 production guidance in the run-up to the July 2021 Merger, assuring investors in May 2021 and July 2021 that it would produce 20,000 electric vehicles in 2022. The Merger closed on July 23, 2021, and Lucid’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq on July 26, 2021. By going public through the SPAC Merger, Lucid secured $4.4 billion in additional funding. On September 28, 2021, Lucid announced that—after multiple delays—it had finally begun production of the Air. Lucid made its first deliveries of the Air to customers on October 30, 2021. The Class Period begins on November 15, 2021—the day that Lucid announced its first quarterly results as a public company. On that day, Lucid told investors that they were “confident in [their] ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022.” As for potential risks to that production, Lucid expressly directed investors only to then-existing “ongoing challenges facing the automotive industry, with global disruptions to supply chains and logistics,” but, in the same breath, assured investors that “[w]e are taking steps to mitigate these challenges.” In the weeks leading up to November 15, 2021, Lucid internally admitted that it would miss its production targets. In particular, according to a former employee, during a meeting in October 2021 or the first week of November 2021, Rawlinson told a small group of Lucid employees that the company would miss its targets and would produce less than 10,000 vehicles in 2022. Rawlinson further instructed the employees at the meeting to keep the fact that Lucid would miss its 2022 production target confidential. Multiple former Lucid employees confirm that prior to Lucid’s November 2021 statements, Rawlinson was told that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production targets, and that the fact that Lucid would not meet this target was widely understood and discussed within the company, including by Lucid’s top executive management. Lucid also knew at all times leading up to and throughout the Class Period that the company was suffering from severe and pervasive internal problems unique to Lucid that made it impossible for the company to mass produce vehicles. To start, Lucid’s inventory management systems were entirely ineffective and inoperable. This meant that the company’s employees and other workers in Lucid’s warehouse lacked even the most basic information necessary to run the warehouse, including that they had little or no information about how many parts the company actually had at any given time, or even where parts were, and thus could not locate them when the production line requested them. This, in turn, negatively impacted Lucid’s ability to efficiently reorder parts because it was unable to tell when inventory was low on or when it had run out of a particular part. This chaos was compounded by the fact that Lucid’s warehouse was operating significantly above capacity, which not only made it difficult to locate parts in piles stacked up to the ceiling, but also resulted in tens of millions of dollars in parts being smashed and destroyed. As a result of these and other significant internal logistics issues, the company was unable to get parts from its warehouse to its production line in a timely manner, which resulted in frequent production shutdowns. These severe internal logistics issues were plaguing Lucid by no later than the summer of 2021, and persisted until at least the summer of 2022. Even when Lucid’s production was slowed by actual parts shortages—as opposed to an inability to find the parts or get them to the production line—former employees confirmed that many such shortages were problems of Lucid’s own making. This was because the design of the Lucid Air was not sufficiently developed before production was launched and certain parts were not designed for manufacturability. That meant that suppliers were not able to produce parts to meet Lucid’s specifications, causing Lucid to rush to make multiple design changes even after production of the Air had already commenced, or labor to build vehicles with out of spec parts. This, in turn, led to production delays. These facts were well-known by Lucid from day one of the Class Period. Prior to November 2021, Rawlinson and his top lieutenants were directly told about the severe issues in the warehouse, and the negative impact that they were having on Lucid’s ability to produce vehicles. In addition, Rawlinson knew, based on discussions at internal meetings, that the Air’s design was not where it needed to be before Lucid launched production, which caused parts shortages and last minute design changes. Nevertheless, beginning on November 15, 2021, Lucid concealed all of these internal issues that were already having a severe and negative impact on Lucid’s production, and instead told investors that the main risk to the company’s targets was industry-wide supply chain issues, and that they were already mitigating those risks. This gave investors the false and misleading impression that internally Lucid was ready and able to quickly ramp up production, when in truth it was anything but. Analysts and the financial media reacted positively to Lucid’s assurances. For example, the following day, CNBC reported that “[Lucid’s] market capitalization surpassed that of Ford Motor on Tuesday as investors reacted to management confirming production plans for 2022[.]” Bloomberg similarly wrote that Lucid shares “closed up 24% in New York, bringing its value to over $91 billion. . . . The surge in the shares came after Lucid said Monday it remained confident in its ability to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022.” Lucid proceeded to then take full advantage of its artificially inflated stock price. First, on December 8, 2021, Lucid announced a public offering of convertible senior notes. As market commentators noted, by using “[o]pportunistic timing” and “[t]aking advantage of a strong stock price,” Lucid was able to raise over $2 billion in gross proceeds to fund its business. Second, by January 25, 2022, Rawlinson had maintained Lucid’s high market capitalization for long enough to trigger four out of the five tranches of his performance-based stock options. As a result, Rawlinson received nearly 14 million Lucid stock options that were valued at approximately $263 million as of April 28, 2022. Despite having known for months that Lucid would produce less than 10,000 units in 2022, even in mid-February 2022, Lucid still falsely assured investors that Lucid would produce 20,000 cars by year-end. Just two weeks later, however, on Lucid’s February 28, 2022 earnings call, Lucid did an abrupt about-face, admitting that Lucid would miss its 20,000 vehicle target by up to 40%, and slashing the company’s 2022 production guidance to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On this news, Lucid’s stock price fell more than 13%, from a close of $28.98 per share on February 28, 2022, to a close at $24.99 per share on March 1, 2022. Market commentators likewise reacted negatively, calling Lucid’s “massive” guidance cut “particularly disappointing,” a “clear disappointment,” “jarring,” and a “[f]all from grace,” and noting that it “sen[t] shares . . . tumbling” and “plunged Lucid into an uphill battle to regain investor trust.” They further noted that “[t]he biggest threat to Lucid is that it misses on its already lower guidance and further slashes guidance in the coming quarters.” Lucid, of course, knew that Lucid would miss even its reduced guidance figures as a result of the severe internal issues it was facing. Lucid’s internal logistics issues had not improved but, rather, as Rawlinson knew, were only getting worse. As a result, Lucid’s statements on February 28, 2022, were materially false or misleading, and Lucid’s stock price remained artificially inflated. Lucid’s stock price also remained artificially inflated because Lucid continued to conceal the severe internal logistics problems that Lucid was experiencing, and instead misleadingly pinned the blame again on global supply chain and logistics problems that were impacting the automotive industry as a whole. For example, during the February 28, 2022 call, Lucid repeatedly blamed “ongoing, industrywide challenges in logistics and supply chains,” “supply chain challenges” felt by “many manufacturers,” and “supply chain challenges that you’ve heard about in numerous companies across industries this earnings season.” As a result, investors were left with the false and misleading impression that Lucid was primed and ready to mass produce its vehicles, but was being constrained by industry-wide factors. Analysts again credited Lucid’s explanation, reporting that Lucid’s guidance reduction was the result of “supply chain problems,” ‘“extraordinary’ supply-chain pressures,” and “supply chain constraints,” and noting that Lucid “is getting absolutely crushed by short-term challenges such as higher component costs, supply chain issues, and higher shipping costs.” For the remainder of the Class Period, Lucid continued to point to those purported global, industry-wide supply chain issues as the main obstacle to Lucid producing vehicles, while concealing the severe internal logistics issues that were hampering its actual production. On the back of these misrepresentations, Lucid falsely reaffirmed Lucid’s production guidance of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles throughout the spring of 2022. For example, during the company’s May 5, 2022 1Q22 earnings conference call, Lucid again reiterated Lucid’s 12,000 to 14,000 guidance and continued to point to global supply chain issues as the main factor impacting and risk to Lucid’s production, noting that “we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 guidance for the balance of the year, so long as the supply chain logistics disruptions aren’t material and our mitigation plans are effective.” None the wiser, analysts latched onto and repeated Lucid’s statements and false assurances, reporting, for example, that “LCID reiterated its 2022 outlook of 12K-14K units production” and that the company “does see supply chain disruptions from China as the most likely risk.” Bloomberg similarly reported that Lucid “reaffirmed its plans to make as many as 14,000 plug-in vehicles this year” and that the company was “work[ing] to overcome supply-chain challenges that are gripping the automotive industry.” Just a few months later, on August 3, 2022, the relevant truth concealed by Lucid’s false and misleading statements and omissions was fully revealed to the market. That day, in reporting Lucid’s 2Q22 results, Lucid finally revealed what they had known all along—that the company would make less than 10,000 units in 2022, slashing Lucid’s guidance again, this time to 6,000 to 7,000 units. Moreover, although they claimed to have just discovered them, Lucid finally disclosed that Lucid’s inability to ramp production had been caused primarily by severe internal logistics problems unique to Lucid. Departing from Lucid’s prior scapegoating of global supply chain issues, Rawlinson explained that recent developments had “exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes,” which he conceded were the “primary bottlenecks.” In particular, Rawlinson noted that Lucid had struggled with its “ability to speed the correct part to [Lucid’s production] line at the correct time and cadence” and had experienced “unplanned production pauses.” As a result, the company had decided it needed to overhaul its entire “logistics and manufacturing operations.” On this news, Lucid’s common stock price fell approximately 9.7%, from a close of $20.56 per share on August 3, 2022, to a close at $18.56 per share on August 4, 2022. Analysts and market commentators reacted negatively, calling Lucid’s guidance cut “clearly disappointing,” “another disappointing turn,” and “a big step back for Lucid,” and noting that “Lucid Motors will barely make any EVs this year.” Moreover, they reported that the news “will lead to questions about [Lucid’s] ability to produce at scale” and that “Lucid makes a very cool car, but now it needs to find a way to make money while making it or it won’t be around for long.” This lawsuit followed. The Class Period begins on November 15, 2021 and ends on August 3, 2022. Throughout the Class Period, Lucid produced and sold one vehicle—the Lucid Air. The company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LCID.”",

      "summary": "This action arises out of Defendants’ undisclosed failure to monitor and maintain inventory and implement effective internal controls, while simultaneously rushing and failing to roll out Cutera’s new acne-treating laser device, AviClear. Cutera had long been known to the investing public as a company that provided laser-based and other aesthetic and dermatological solutions for medical practitioners, and the new AviClear initiative appeared to fit within that long-term paradigm. The primary motivation for the AviClear rollout, however, was an executive compensation plan—known internally as the “Acne Equity Grant”—that shunted Company stock to the Individual Defendants in direct relation to (i) the number of AviClear devices placed with customers, and (ii) the speed with which such placements occurred. Moreover, throughout the Class Period, and notwithstanding Defendants’ SOX certifications and other sanguine remarks about Cutera’s internal control environment, Defendants consistently failed to control, monitor, and maintain inventory, largely related to problems associated with the failed AviClear rollout. This undisclosed failure of internal controls ultimately required Cutera to restate its financial statements for multiple quarters, particularly financial figures relating to inventory, cost of revenue, gross profit, gross margin, and operating loss. Indeed, Defendants eventually admitted that “we identified a significant issue with how the company has been managing inventory during 2023,” and “there was a shortfall of inventory relative to the Company’s system of record.” Moreover, the internal controls weaknesses had a myriad of operational consequences, including an extended inventory audit-related plant shutdown (which further negatively impacted Cutera’s business) and rampant quality control, supply chain, and field service problems due to the Company’s inability to forecast and track inventory. Relatedly, Defendants’ failure to execute the AviClear rollout not only exacerbated these problems, but also over-allocated the Company’s manufacturing and sales resources to AviClear at the expense of Cutera’s core business segments which, up to that point, had generated steady and reliable revenue. The failed rollout likewise increased product returns and excess AviClear inventory, which contributed to the Company’s overall inventory and internal control problems. Defendants’ Class Period conduct ultimately culminated in the terminations, with cause, of Defendants Mowry and Plants, and the resignation of Defendant Seth. As Defendants themselves conceded, Cutera was managed by “suboptimal leadership.” Despite these undisclosed problems relating to non-functioning internal controls over inventory and experiencing poor financial performance as a result of the failed AviClear rollout, Defendants repeatedly claimed throughout the Class Period that the Company’s internal controls were operating effectively, that the AviClear rollout was a success, and that Cutera’s core revenue-generating business segments were flourishing. In fact, Defendants certified that they reviewed the Company’s financial reporting and that all figures contained therein were accurate—figures of which Defendants eventually admitted were materially false. The underlying truth was ultimately revealed over a span of months during 2023 and 2024, whereby the Company disclosed: material weaknesses over financial reporting; multiple poor earnings results caused by its failure to properly roll out AviClear; that it had fired Mowry and Plants “with cause”; the departure of Defendant Seth; quality control problems leading to frequent equipment breakdowns and customer frustration; an extended plant shutdown caused by an inventory audit; poor AviClear utilization trends; numerous delays in making routine filings with the SEC; and restated financials for multiple quarters. In response, Cutera’s stock plummeted—injuring shareholders.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Rain is a clinical-stage precision oncology company that was founded in 2017 and incorporated in Delaware. When Rain went public in April 2021, its initial public offering documents featured the company’s licensing deal with Daiichi Sankyo for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize milademetan. Milademetan is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (“MDM2”). MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors (which is a category of drugs that included milademetan) have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Although MDM2 inhibitors have been studied for almost two decades, none has progressed past early-phase clinical trials in solid-tumor patients due to the fact that they cause myelosuppression (i.e., a decrease in bone marrow activity that results in reduced production of blood cells). Daiichi Sankyo conducted milademetan’s Phase 1 clinical trial. The trial was officially titled “A Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Study of Milademetan in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas” but Daiichi Sankyo referred to it as “U101”. U101 took place between July 2013 and October 2020. It was a single-arm, open-label study designed to test milademetan in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas. When initiated in July 2013, the study represented the first clinical trial in which milademetan was administered to humans, i.e., a first-in-human study. One of U101’s primary objectives was to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose, according to Daiichi Sankyo’s study plan. Daiichi Sankyo conducted U101 at five test sites within the United States. Initially, U101 consisted of two parts: Part 1 was a dose-escalation part aimed at identifying the maximum tolerable dose; and Part 2 was a dose-expansion part to test the safety and tolerability of potential doses. Part 2 was ultimately abandoned after Daiichi Sankyo determined it could not meet the objectives under its dosing schedule because the dose identified as effective was not tolerable, i.e., the dose was too toxic for study participants. U101’s study protocol identified various endpoints to measure the efficacy of milademetan. These efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, time to response, response duration, and progression-free survival. During the trial, milademetan was initially given orally once daily on a 28-day cycle at a starting dose of 15 mg. Due to excessive toxicity, Daiichi Sankyo explored intermittent dosing schedules and ultimately identified a recommended dose for further evaluation (i.e., the recommended Phase 2 dose) of 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days. This dose was not part of the initial study protocol but instead identified while U101 was underway. Only 16 study participants with dedifferentiated liposarcoma received this dose in the U101 trial. This subgroup of study participants represented 15% of U101’s overall population. The subgroup demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months (compared to 2.1 months under current standard of care treatment). Rain’s prospectus for the initial public offering described Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial for milademetan. It explained that the “objective of the Phase 1 trial was to identify a maximum tolerated dose” and that over the course of the trial, it developed an “intermittent dosing schedule” that would be used in future trials. The intermittent dosing schedule (referred to as “Schedule D”) was a dose of 260 mg for three days every 14 days, as described above (i.e., 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days). Rain told investors that “patients treated on Schedule D at a dose of 260 mg (MTD) had a mPFS of 7.4 months, which was longer than the reported mPFS of 2.2 months for trabectedin and 2.0 months for eribulin in WD/DD LPS patients.” In other words, Rain represented “[d]ata from WD/DD LPS patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated median progression-free survival (mPFS) approximately three to four times greater than the current standards of care (SOC), trabectedin or eribulin.” When describing the Phase 1 trial data, Rain’s prospectus did not disclose Daiichi Sankyo’s intent to conduct a two-part trial, where the first part would be to identify a dose and the second part would then test that dose across an expanded population, or that the results of the Phase 1 trial would be used to develop and conduct a Phase 2 trial. Instead, Rain stated repeatedly that the Phase 1 trial results supported “rapidly” advancing directly to a “pivotal Phase 3 trial in WD/DD LPS patients.” Analysts from top-tier investment banks issued “buy” and “overweight” ratings based on Rain’s representations. These analysts echoed Rain’s statements about the Phase 1 trial data and how it significantly “de-risked” milademetan and supported the Company’s plans to advance directly to a Phase 3 trial. Rain used its initial public offering to raise $121.9 million in net proceeds from retail investors. According to its prospectus, Rain intended to use approximately $60 million of the cash to fund clinical trials, including its “pivotal Phase 3 trial” for milademetan. Rain told investors in its prospectus that the cash raised from the initial public offering was sufficient to fund operations through 2024. On July 20, 2021, Rain commenced its Phase 3 trial for milademetan. Rain referred to the trial as the “MANTRA” trial and described it as follows: The MANTRA trial, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RAIN-32 compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care, in patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without a well-differentiated (WD) LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy. Approximately 160 patients are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan or trabectedin. The primary objective of the trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient reported outcomes. Analysts reported that Rain commenced the Phase 3 trial in line with its prior guidance, i.e., the second half of 2021 or 2H21. Analysts also reiterated that the Phase 3 trial was clinically de-risked, given Rain’s statements about the Phase 1 trial data. Analysts reconfirmed their “overweight” and “buy” ratings for Rain. On September 20, 2021, while Rain’s Phase 3 trial was ongoing, Daiichi Sankyo published results from a separate clinical trial testing milademetan in patients with intimal sarcoma (i.e., tumors that arise in the pulmonary artery). The trial results reported unusually high rates of hematologic toxicities, including Grade 3 events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreases, and anemia. The results also included a 20% objective response rate. The study participants received 260 mg doses of milademetan. On May 22, 2023, Rain announced topline results for its Phase 3 trial, i.e., the MANTRA trial. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression free survival. In pertinent part, Rain described the results as follows: The median PFS for milademetan was 3.6 months vs 2.2 months for trabectedin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89, p=0.53. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the milademetan arm included nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and neutropenia. The most common Grade 3/4 TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (39.5%), neutropenia (25.5%) and anemia (18.6%). Dose reductions in the milademetan arm were 44.2% vs 29.1% in the trabectedin arm. Discontinuation in the milademetan arm due to AEs were 11.6% vs 19.0% for trabectedin. Based upon these topline data, Rain does not expect to pursue further development of milademetan in DD LPS. . . . Phase 3 MANTRA Topline Data Results: The median PFS was 3.6 months with milademetan versus 2.2 months for trabectedin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI [0.61 to 1.29]; p=0.53) based on 115 events Most common TEAEs in the milademetan arm included nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and neutropenia The most common Grade 3/4 TEAEs in the milademetan arm were thrombocytopenia (39.5%), neutropenia (25.5%) and anemia (18.6%) Dose reductions in the milademetan arm were 44.2% vs 29.1% in the trabectedin arm Discontinuations in the milademetan arm due to AEs were 11.6% vs 19.0% for trabectedin Treatment emergent SAEs in the milademetan arm were 36.0% vs 48.1% in the trabectedin arm Analysts from several top-tier investment banks downgraded Rain in response to the news. In their reports, the analysts noted the risks of proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial from Phase 1. They also noted that the Phase 3 trial results included more Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events (i.e., thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia) than anticipated. According to the analysts, the elevated level of adverse events suggested that the dosing schedule had not been properly optimized during the Phase 1 trial. Analysts also noted that Rain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Robert C. Doebele, acknowledged during a conference call earlier in the day that the 260 mg dose was too high. Rain abandoned its clinical trial plan for milademetan after the Phase 3 trial failed. On May 22, 2023, contemporaneously with the announcements of the Phase 3 trial results, Rain confirmed that it was no longer pursuing any line of therapy involving milademetan for the treatment of DD LPS. Given that DD LPS was the highest probability indication for an MDM2 inhibitor (such as milademetan), analysts immediately lowered their models for Rain while investors likewise decided to exit their positions in the stock. In the span of just one day, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023 to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023. On May 28, 2023, Rain suspended ongoing clinical development of milademetan. The Company also decided to wind down research and development activities, implement a substantial reduction in force, and initiate a review of strategic alternatives. Rain’s Board of Directors also instructed management to identify potential financial advisors to assist the Company in connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives. On May 30, 2023, Rain announced plans to suspend further development of milademetan, including suspension of enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2 MANTRA-2 basket trial and the termination of plans for its Phase 1/2 MANTRA-4 combination trial, as well as a reduction in headcount of approximately 65%, and a plan to evaluate alternatives to enhance its pipeline through precision oncology program acquisitions or other transactions. On August 10, 2023, Rain reported its financial earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In pertinent part, the Company announced it had decided to discontinue the entire development program for milademetan, including its other ongoing MANTRA studies. Rain also announced it had decided to focus on “cost-saving measures, including a reduction in force,” and was actively looking for new opportunities to license or acquire clinical-stage programs and technologies. On October 17, 2023, Rain entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Pathos AI, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing artificial intelligence-powered pathology tools. The purpose of the agreement was to allow both companies to share information with one another to negotiate a merger or acquisition. On November 16, 2023, Rain and Pathos AI executed a proposal whereby Pathos AI would acquire Rain through a tender offer. On December 13, 2023, Rain announced the acquisition by Pathos AI. According to the announcement, Pathos AI will acquire Rain for $1.16 per share plus contingent value rights equaling approximately $0.17 per share based on the deal closing and milademetan’s first patient dosing within five years. Rain shareholders presently have until January 25, 2024 to tender their shares under the terms of the acquisition agreement. Rain contravened customary practices, industry standards, and widely-accepted academic literature by abandoning Daiichi Sankyo’s clinical trial plans and advancing milademetan directly from Phase 1 to Phase 3, i.e., Phase 2 Bypass. Milademetan did not qualify for Phase 2 Bypass. Its mechanism of action and safety profile were not well characterized. Milademetan was a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (previously defined as “MDM2”). MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors (which is a category of drugs that includes milademetan) have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Although MDM2 inhibitors have been studied for almost two decades, none has progressed past early-phase clinical trials in solid-tumor patients due to the fact that they cause myelosuppression (i.e., a decrease in bone marrow activity that results in reduced production of blood cells). Milademetan, as an MDM2 inhibitor, had not received marketing authorization from any regulatory agency and, as such, the drug had no clinical practice history. In fact, Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial was a “first-in-human” study, meaning that it was the first time ever that milademetan was administered to humans. According to Daiichi Sankyo’s study protocol, the goal of the Phase 1 trial was to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose, thereby confirming that a Phase 2 dose had been and was intended to follow the Phase 1 trial. The need for a Phase 2 trial was especially prevalent given that Daiichi Sankyo was unable to complete Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial, as initially anticipated. Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial was supposed to serve as a dose expansion part in which the recommended dose would be administered to an expanded population of study participants. Instead, Daiichi Sankyo identified the recommended Phase 2 dose (i.e., 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days) during the Phase 1 as opposed to being part of the study protocol from the outset, which undermined the reliability of the results. In total, the Phase 1 trial data that Rain supposedly relied upon when advancing directly to Phase 3 consisted of only 16 patients, which amounted to only 15% of the overall Phase 1 trial participants. Former Employee 1 (“FE1”) was a Senior Director, Program Management, at Rain from December 2020 to December 2021. FE1 was responsible for the coordination of drug development, working with different teams from different departments within the Company. FE1’s duties included tracking the development progress of a drug and providing senior leadership, including Vellanki and Bryce, with updates. FE1 reported to Vellanki. FE1 confirmed that within the field of oncology drug development, Phase 2 trials are generally necessary to “dial down” on the specific dosing level of the drug candidate. Phase 2 trials are used to identify a dose or doses that are then tested in a Phase 3 trial, according to FE1. FE1 explained that milademetan, in particular, was very difficult and challenging in terms of identifying a dose because it was not suitable for daily use due to the biology of the molecule at issue and the toxicity it created. Milademetan necessitated atypical dosing. FE1 confirmed further that the Phase 1 trial conducted by Daiichi Sankyo did not “dial in” the dosing for milademetan. In fact, FE1 confirmed that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 study recommended a dosing schedule for a Phase 2 trial as opposed to a Phase 3 trial. Daiichi Sankyo’s trial results indicated a “recommended Phase 2 dose,” which means that the dose is then tested in a Phase 2 trial, according to FE1. FE1 explained that drug developers generally do not advance directly to Phase 3 trials at this point because the dataset, i.e., the patient population, for dosing schedules is usually too small. FE1 explained further that if drug developers or sponsors proceed straight to Phase 3 with a “recommended Phase 2 dose” from a Phase 1 trial, the dosing schedule might not work and the study may need to be redone. A Phase 2 trial allows the sponsor to test the recommended Phase 2 dose accordingly and then, if the data supports it, commence a Phase 3 trial to confirm the results. FE1 explained that in the case of Rain and milademetan, the Company should advancing directly from Phase 1 to Phase 3 was a big jump and pretty aggressive given the limited amount of patient data collected by Daiichi Sankyo in the Phase 1 trial, i.e., <20 patients. FE1 further explained that Vellanki and Bryce were aware of the Phase 1 trial data and the limitations it presented. FE1 said that Vellanki understood that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial recommended a Phase 2 dosing schedule and not a Phase 3 dosing schedule. FE1 also said that Bryce, who is a seasoned drug development executive, likewise understood the results and data from the Phase 1 trial and the fact that it recommended a Phase 2 dose instead of a Phase 3 dose. According to FE1, Vellanki and Bryce had substantial experience and consequently understood the data they had, its limitations, and the import of the decisions they were making. Rain’s competitors, who were developing similar drug candidates for similar treatments, followed the ordinary progression of the clinical trial process. Kartos Therapeutics, Aileron Therapeutics Inc., Ascentage Pharma Group, Boehringer Ingelheim, Astex Pharmaceuticals, or Novartis AG were either conducting dose escalation trials or pursuing other indications, such as myelofibrosis (Kartos’ KRT-232/AMG-232), hematologic malignancies (Roche Holding AG’s idasanutlin), or chemotherapy protectants (Aileron Therapeutics’ 6924). None was willing to contravene the customary practices, industry standards, or academic literature by engaging in a Phase 2 Bypass. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Defendants repeatedly referred to the Phase 2 Bypass as a benefit instead of disclosing the acute risks it created. Defendants’ failure to inform"

      "summary": "Fastly operates an edge cloud platform for processing, serving, and securing customer applications. Its platform includes a Content Delivery Network (“CDN”), or a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. Content owners, such as media companies and e-commerce vendors, pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In other words, Fastly’s customers are delivering web experiences, whether in the form of applications, websites, or streaming services. Certain companies have adopted a “Multi-CDN” framework which combines multiple CDNs from various providers into one large global network. The bulk of the company’s revenue is derived from its existing customers’ use of Fastly’s platform, although the company generates some revenue from additional products and other services, such as account management and customer support. Fastly charges customers based on their use of the company’s platform and typically enters into contracts that include a monthly minimum billing commitment in exchange for more favorable pricing terms. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, roughly 95% of the company’s revenue was derived from customers’ use of its platform and new customers contributed less than 10% of that revenue. The majority of the company’s revenue is generated by its enterprise customers, which were previously defined as those customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the trailing 12-month period, but are currently defined as those customers with annualized current quarter revenue in excess of $100,000, which is calculated by taking the revenue recognized in the current quarter and multiplying it by four. The company’s ten largest customers, which one confidential witness referred to as “big whales,” include large streaming accounts and other accounts in the media space such as TikTok, Amazon Video, Apple, Twitter (X), Netflix, Paramount, and Disney. These customers account for a significant portion of the company’s revenue, generating 37% of the company’s revenue in FY 2023. Thus, a decline in revenue from the company’s existing enterprise customers, especially its largest customers, or a decline in retention of such customers, could create volatility in the company’s revenue and materially impact Fastly’s business. Against that backdrop, beginning in November 2023, Defendants began to mislead investors about how macroeconomic trends and uncertainties (i.e., the impact of rising interest rates, banking instability, and recession fears) were affecting the company’s business. During a November 15, 2023 conference, in response to a question about whether “macro trends” were getting better, Nightingale replied: “The biggest pressure that people saw in this area was like in small to medium SMB customers, maybe some of the mid market. We don’t have a lot of exposure there. . . . [s]o I didn’t see too many headwinds. The only thing we saw was a little bit of elongated deal flow.” When pressed, Nightingale responded, “My competitors are seeing these effects, some slowing in growth, and [] we’re not seeing that.” However, according to one confidential witness, such statements were “BS,” and Nightingale was “probably just trying to keep the share price afloat.” That same confidential witness explained that 30 to 40% of the company’s sales team was dedicated to the small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) segment of the market. Another confidential witness, who worked with mid market enterprise customers, described how beginning in March and April of 2023, customers began requesting more aggressive discounts. There was a direct correlation between when customers began asking for these discounts and when interest rates began rising significantly. In addition, one confidential witness explained that, contrary to Nightingale’s November 2023 public statements, macro forces, such as rising interest rates, were “definitely in the business cycle” and in fact, negatively affecting the company’s revenues overall throughout 2023, including revenues from Fastly’s largest customers, who were increasingly more price-conscious. Adding to the pressures on Fastly was the fact that Fastly’s competitors (i.e., Cloudflare, Akamai, and Imperva) in the CDN market had caught up to the company in technological prowess. Thus, Fastly had far less leverage in negotiating prices with its customers. The previously downplayed risks of macro effects on the company’s business began to materialize when the company announced its Q4 and FY 2023 financial results on February 14, 2024. The company reported revenues of $506 million for FY 2023 and $137.8 million for Q4 2023. The reported Q4 2023 revenue was on the lower side of their previous guidance and, according to Zacks Investment Research, missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1%. In response to this news, Fastly’s stock price fell significantly, from $23.54 to close at $16.34 on February 15, 2024, a decline of 30.59 %. However, Defendants continued to mislead investors by making misleading statements about the company’s customer retention rates and its existing customers’ continued expansion of their use of Fastly’s services. During the February 14, 2024 earnings call with investors and analysts, Nightingale stated that the company’s “customer retention efforts were stable in the fourth quarter.” When pressed by analysts on whether there were fundamental changes to the business in light of macroeconomic trends and uncertainties affecting the company, Nightingale stated unequivocally in the conference call, “No, I think it was pretty much as we saw last quarter. A handful of deals may be taking a little longer than we thought, a little bit of deals elongation.” However, according to various confidential witnesses, in 2023, the appetite for Fastly’s services was declining. These confidential witnesses describe how numerous enterprise customers were canceling their contracts in 2023 and it was very difficult to land new clients. For example, Indeed and USAA did not renew their contracts with Fastly in 2023. In or around March and April of 2023, some enterprise customers began requesting steeper discounts when negotiating contract renewals with Fastly. The revenue decline became apparent to one confidential witness in November 2023, when they began to struggle to meet sales quotas. By the end of 2023, only 30 percent of salespeople met their revenue targets. Customers continued to experience a stagnation in growth in 2024. Both the macro impacts on the company’s business and the declining appetite for Fastly’s services was well known throughout the company and the company’s C-Suite because the company regularly held quarterly “all hands” meetings at the company’s San Francisco office, which discussed the overall state of the business, including, but not limited to, the effect of macro forces on the company’s business in 2023. All hands meetings typically were held a week after the company’s earnings calls and would provide a recap of what was discussed during the earnings call. They would include slide deck presentations and were attended by the company’s C-Suite and all employees, who either attended in-person or could tune into the meetings live via Vimeo. Recordings of the meetings were distributed to all employees by email after the meeting. By November 2023, during these all hands meetings, Nightingale was discussing how the company’s largest accounts were not bringing in as much traffic to Fastly. Specifically, during the November 2023 all hands meeting, which occurred shortly after Fastly’s November 1, 2023 Q3 2023 earnings call, Nightingale spoke about “decreasing revenue from [the company’s] big customers” and discussed how Fastly’s large media accounts had “throttled down” their usage, warning that a specific streaming company was “throttling things back, which is why revenue is down.” One confidential witness corroborated seeing this trend with their customers, stating that “New business really started falling off a cliff in Q4 .” The decline in traffic was also known to Defendants because the company’s top executives – including, occasionally, Nightingale – attended weekly meetings throughout the relevant period, during which the company’s customers were rated based on how much traffic they were transmitting through Fastly’s platform. If a major enterprise customer continued to be rated poorly, a “tiger team” was assembled to focus on improving that customer’s performance. Notwithstanding the discussion behind the scenes about the company’s largest customers “throttling things back” in November 2023, during the February 14, 2024 earnings call, Nightingale also misleadingly attributed the company coming in at the lower end of its guidance range to “weaker than anticipated international traffic, offset by seasonally strong live streaming and gaming activity” while omitting the critical information that a substantial contributor to the revenue decline was several of the company’s largest customers simultaneously experiencing a decline in traffic. Defendants continued to make similarly misleading statements in its annual report filed on February 22, 2024, touting that the company’s existing enterprise customers were increasing their spend on Fastly’s platform and continuing to drive the company’s revenue growth. Further, Defendants claimed that any chance of its existing customers decreasing their use of Fastly’s platform was a hypothetical risk, despite the fact that the risk had already materialized. Additional negative information corrective of Defendants’ prior misrepresentations emerged on May 1, 2024, when Fastly hosted an earnings call to discuss the company’s Q1 2024 financial results. During that call, Defendants decreased the company’s FY 2024 revenue projections from a range of $580 million to $590 million to a range of $555 million to $565 million, blaming the decline in revenue on some of the company’s largest customers. Specifically, Defendants disclosed that the “biggest factor” contributing to a revenue decline was “a reduction of revenue from a small number of [the company’s] largest customers,” explaining that there was “a slight uptick from the typical level of rerates with [the company’s] largest customers,” which was not accompanied by “the commensurate traffic expansion usually associated with this motion.” When pressed for further detail on the timing of that pricing pressure from some of the company’s largest accounts, Kisling clarified “[A] lot of that arose really at the end of March and in early April” with “negotiations result[ing] in bigger discounts than we thought that did not come with the typical increase in traffic that we’ve seen historically.” Analysts reacted negatively to the volatility with some of the company’s largest customers. For example, on May 2, 2024, BofA downgraded Fastly stock from “Buy” to “Underperform,” citing the “[d]ecelerating growth in Fastly’s largest customers” as a basis to question “a rebound in 2024.” Similarly, D.A. Davidson downgraded Fastly’s stock from “Buy” to “NEUTRAL,” expressing concern about the company’s apparent expectation to “recover[] traffic with large customers,” and stating “[w]e cannot get comfortable with that premise given what’s transpired over the last two quarters.” Following these developments, Fastly’s stock price fell $4.14 per share, or 32.02%, to close at $8.79 per share on May 2, 2024. Nevertheless, Defendants continued to withhold the full truth from investors about the company’s revenue prospects from its existing enterprise customers, including its largest customers. During the May 2, 2024 earnings call, Nightingale portrayed the revenue decline from the company’s top customers as stabilizing, stating: “Right now, we have already launched a new engagement model. We’re driving a far higher touch across all those major accounts. We’ve been running it for a couple of weeks now, and we’re – I’m pretty happy with the progress so far.” In reality, Defendants had not made any progress with its largest customers. To the contrary, according to one confidential witness who was tasked with developing a product for two of the company’s largest customers, Apple and Amazon, Apple and Amazon had been requesting the product since 2023 and the company promised to deliver it by the end of 2023, but the company had not even begun working on it until May 2024. Nightingale told that confidential witness to do whatever was needed to get the project done. Defendants also continued to mislead investors about the company continuing to drive growth through existing customers. In the company’s Q1 2024 Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q on May 1, 2024, Defendants repeated that the company is “focused on . . . expanding [its] relationship with existing customers” and “emphasize[s] retaining [its] customers and expanding their usage of [Fastly’s] platform and adoption of [the company’s] other products.” However, by that time, Defendants had shifted the company’s focus away from driving revenue growth through existing customers, implementing a new sales strategy using a new compensation model in 2024 that prioritized revenue generated from new customer acquisitions over existing customers, thereby incentivizing the sales team to focus their efforts on new customer growth. Historically, new customers only accounted for less than 10% of the company’s revenue derived from the use of its platform. The company’s Q1 2024 Quarterly Report also discussed the risk of existing customers, especially the company’s largest customers, decreasing their use of the company’s platform as hypothetical risks when, in reality, the risk had already materialized, as existing customers’ use of Fastly’s platform had been stagnating for at least a quarter. The full truth came to light on August 7, 2024, when the company hosted an earnings call to discuss its Q2 2024 financial results and disclosed that revenue from the company’s largest customers was continuing to decline and the company had shifted its focus towards new customer acquisitions in order to diversify and mitigate the company’s dependence on its largest customers. Fastly’s top 10 customers’ revenue share had fallen from 40% to 34% in two quarters. Analysts reacted negatively. For instance, on August 7, 2024, Piper Sandler noted there was now “likely lack of management credibility for at least the next few quarters.” In an August 8, 2024 report, Craig-Hallum Capital noted that “[t]he team did make it clear that the decline was not in the whole top 10, but a ‘small handful’ of the top 10 in the media vertical. This would seem to imply declines of major magnitude at those customers, something on the order of halving revenue at those three or four customers.” It added, “[t]here will be questions around management’s visibility after this surprise” and “FSLY is bleeding badly when it comes to large customers and is providing very little visibility. . . . [I]nvestors are going to need more information.” Following these developments, Fastly’s stock price fell $0.98 per share, or 14.33%, to close at $5.86 per share on August 8, 2024. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the company’s securities, Plaintiffs and other class members have suffered significant losses and damages.",

      "summary": "Plaintiffs are short sellers of Vicor securities who allege that representations made by Defendant Patrizio Vinciarelli, CEO of Vicor, during a July 25, 2023, earnings call were misleading. Plaintiffs allege that Vinciarelli falsely represented that Vicor had a contract with an existing significant customer that was related to Vicor’s newest product, which Vicor would deliver starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. Plaintiffs argue that the statement was misleading because Vicor did not have a purchase order with the customer at the time of the call, and the contract was non-binding and subject to cancellation by the customer. Plaintiffs allege that the statement artificially inflated the price of Vicor’s stock, forcing Plaintiffs to cover their short positions at a loss. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of short sellers who covered their short positions in the days following and including October 24, 2023. Vicor designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and complete power systems that deliver and/or manage electrical power for deployment in, among other areas, high-performance computing, industrial equipment and automation, robotics, unmanned and manned vehicles, and satellites. Vicor’s two largest customers had been Google and Nvidia, and one of Vicor’s significant feats early on was having its power-management components featured as part of Nvidia’s Artificial Intelligence chips and in Google’s 48V server infrastructure. However, when Nvidia’s new AI chips emerged in 2022 but did not feature Vicor’s power designs or components, Vicor’s shares slid over 20%. By early 2023, many market commentators who follow the industry, and those who follow Vicor specifically, were questioning the continued reliability of the relationship between Vicor and Nvidia or Google. Through July 2023, according to its public SEC filings, Vicor repeatedly failed to achieve expected milestones, its order backlog shrunk with new orders not replacing the older ones as they were delivered, and revenue declined. Vicor further reported $4.5 million fewer accounts receivable for that period in this same filing. These reflected a continuing trend in Vicor’s performance that was cemented by the fact that it had lost its relationship with Nvidia and Google. Thus, to the common investor, Vicor’s stock appeared significantly overvalued given the business’s condition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated looked at Vicor’s downward trend as a core thesis for shorting Vicor’s stock. Each Plaintiff—and those similarly situated—took several short positions over the course of approximately twelve weeks starting on or around May 1, 2023. According to publicly available data, over three million shares had been sold short as of July 25, 2023. This does not include the number of short positions taken by investors via options positions or other derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. Shortly before trading closed on July 25, 2023, Vicor released its Q2 earnings report. Its companion press release on that day concluded with the first bit of real good news in a while: Commenting on second quarter performance, Chief Executive Officer Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q2 bookings remained weak, ahead of production release of an AI platform with a Lateral Power Distribution Network (‘PDN’) using a 4G ChiP-set, now expected to ramp in Q4. The same 4G ChiP-set will support a more adept Lateral-Vertical PDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy workloads and superior processor performance.” The message was plain: newly booked sales of the Lateral Power Distribution Network (itself a new product) would reverse the lengthy trend of “weak” sales. During Vicor’s 2023 Q2 earnings call after the market closed that same day, July 25, 2023, the analysts’ questions reflected that they received the same message: Good news—a customer had been confirmed for the new product. The only question the analysts wanted an answer to was how big of a customer. For example, Quinn Bolton, an analyst from Needham & Company who follows Vicor, asked Vinciarelli about how large a difference in sales this customer was likely to represent in the fourth quarter: Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. First question is, can you guys share any more details on the 4G lateral power distribution design that you mentioned in the press release for a new AI platform that ramps in the fourth quarter. Can you say, is this a new customer? Have you worked with this customer previously? Can you give us any sense of what our consumption is for this part? Is it a high power card? Is it a mid-range power card? Any details you can share would be very helpful. Patrizio Vinciarelli It’s an existing customer. It’s a new generation for the existing customer. And it’s a chipset that can be deployed either in a lateral PDN, which is substantially handicapped from a power system perspective to the point that it limits power delivery, power capability, process of performance, in that it gives rise to large losses within the copper of the substrate to the GPU, that it powers. It gives rise to further losses within the system itself, or into the limitations of lateral power delivery applied at the 1,000 amp level. With a 4G chipset, we can enable a lateral solution with the same handicaps, or with a vertical element using the same chipset, a lateral vertical solution, which is unique, highly differentiated, in that it improves system efficiency by about 10%. And it improves a number of limitations relating to process of performance. The question posed to Vinciarelli indicated that the market was focusing on the news that the new customer agreement would overcome the prior quarters’ weak sales. This was the only real positive news about Vicor in several quarters, and especially during that time frame. On that same call, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, John Dillon, again attempted to confirm the size of the customer with Vinciarelli who confirmed it was a large customer: John Dillon Okay, great. I want to follow up on Quinn’s question a little bit. . . . Regarding the lateral vertical opportunity that’s coming to production in Q4, is that a high-volume customer is more of a lower volume or more of a modest volume customer [sic]? Patrizio Vinciarelli So, to be clear, I’ve suggested earlier, the same chip set, which is a 4G chip set, supports both the lateral and the lateral vertical. Based on constant input expectation, as of now, is that the lateral implementation will go first. And that's the one we’re anticipating for the Q4 ramp. I can’t tell you when the lateral vertical was going to production, but my expectation is that it would be after the lateral. John Dillon Yes, but is this going to be a significant customer or is this more of an incremental volume that you’re going to expect? Patrizio Vinciarelli This is a significant customer. Throughout the call, Vicor admitted to the poor performance and prospects (namely, the radical decrease in orders in the prior quarters), but Vinciarelli explicitly touted that a “significant” “existing” customer had agreed to make product purchases, the delivery of which was slated to begin in Q4 2023. Vicor’s management—Vinciarelli included—gave specific details regarding the customer as if they were real, e.g., that the customer would use the lateral PDN implementation first and the lateral-vertical PDN implementation later. Management of Vicor gave additional, specific details that the customer would have power delivery “applied at the 1,000 amp level.” Management reiterated that this concerned an “existing” and “significant” Vicor customer seeking the “new generation” part. These details gave the unmistakable impression that a concrete deal had been reached for an existing—not speculative—large customer of a significant number of purchases in the fourth quarter, which would have reversed Vicor’s trend of declining and weak sales. Consistent with the messaging, the market took this information to suggest that Vicor had a new partnership deal with Nvidia or Google. The market’s reaction to this news was immediate and pronounced: whereas Vicor’s stock had closed on July 25, 2023, at $59 before the above earnings announcements, it then opened the next morning on July 26, 2023, at $77.40 and closed at the end of the day at $93.70, reaching an intra-day high of over $94. Average trading volume prior to and after July 26, 2023, had been consistent at around 800,000 to 1.2 million shares per day; but on July 26, 2023, volume exceeded 4.5 million shares, roughly five to six times higher than normal. Because of the skyrocketing price, and in reliance on the announcement of a new “significant customer” who was also an “existing customer,” each Plaintiff was forced to cover their short positions at a significant loss—roughly $35 per share on average, in addition to the roughly $15 per share they would have realized had they not needed to purchase cover. Plaintiffs were forced to cover their short positions in reliance on the news and the market’s overnight internalization of the news. On October 24, 2023, Vicor held its third quarter earnings call. On the call, Vicor failed to mention the customer discussed on the July 25, 2023 call. The analysts’ questions again confirmed what everyone had taken away from the July 25, 2023 call: Vicor had a confirmed big customer. In response, Vicor prevaricated. Vicor did not disclose that its supposed “existing” and “significant” customer had backed out or changed its mind; instead, Vicor denied that it ever said it had such a customer: [Analyst] Quinn Bolton Last quarter you guys seemed pretty excited about this new AI platform that you expected to ramp in the fourth quarter of 2023 and throughout 2024. Can you just give us any updates on that program? How are you feeling about it, is it still on track? Have you started to see more bookings associated for that? [Vicor Sr. VP of Sales] Philip D. “Phil” Davies So, Quinn, this is Phil. So, the first part of your question, I think, was what we talked about the last call. And my prepared remarks, I basically said that the first area of focus was to ramp in Q4, our 48-volt bus converters, and factorized power solutions. I hope that answers that question pretty clearly. . . . As I said, we’re having substantial conversations now with customers that will diversify us away from the two big guys that we’ve been doing business with, for the next -- for the last few years. So, as I said, I’m very confident in the future and where we stand and it’s a bit of a complex landscape. In his attempt to retreat from the prior call’s statement that Vicor had already landed a whale of a customer, Phil Davies, a senior manager at Vicor, pivoted away entirely and did not even attempt to explain what happened to the customer. John Dillon, the Goldman Sachs analyst, jumped in to reassert what was said on July 25th—and again, Vicor attempted to deny ever having made the representation: John Dillon So, with the one major customer though, do they have two different designs with you? One for . . . are they working with two different . . . the one customer, do they two different GPUs that are going to be used, in one using lateral, the other’s going to be using lateral-vertical? Or is the same GPU that’s initially going to use lateral, then going to lateral-vertical? Patrizio Vinciarelli John, we’re not going to talk about any one customer. I’m sorry, but bear with us, that’s not a level of specificity we want to get involved with. ….. John Dillon On the last call, you stated you had a lateral and a lateral-vertical opportunity with a major GPU customer. I was wondering, was that for the same GPU or was it for two separate GPUs? Phil Davies So what we talked about there was that we have lateral and lateral-vertical solutions for not just one customer. We are bringing that solution forward, and we have customers looking at that, both of those solutions. And certainly, the number of customers looking at lateral deployment is a little bit higher than the number with lateral-vertical, but we have both. Patrizio Vinciarelli And that’s also the way in which systems have evolved, but make no mistake. The future, and the future is coming next year, is no longer with lateral PDNs. Another analyst, Richard Shannon also reconfirmed that the prior call had evinced an existing customer relationship, which Vicor denied ever having represented: [Analyst] Richard Shannon Hi, Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Let’s see, a couple of questions. Maybe a follow-up on the topic of bookings here. I think last quarter, you felt fairly confident that the backlogs would improve either in the ending third quarter or fourth quarter. Now, it seems you’re less certain of that. And I think if I understood one of the answers to a prior question, you’re still expecting the design with a major customer to -- that is still active here. So, it seems like a couple of simple explanations for that would be either that design is delayed or your share of the size of the opportunity is more limited than what you initially had thought or potentially there’s other reasons. So, can you help us understand those dynamics relative to your last conference call? Patrizio Vinciarelli I think I made clear that we really don’t want to go into the level of detail. And to be clear, well, I appreciate the reason for the interest, the curiosity, it’s really got very little to do with Vicor’s opportunity in the medium and long term. And that’s what we’re really focused on. The questions make clear that the market and the analysts all heard the same thing on July 25th, and were now hearing the opposite. Vinciarelli’s pivot that the customer relationship announced on July 25, 2023, “had very little to do with” Vicor’s business “in the medium and long term” is shocking given how gung-ho he had been just three months earlier. Thus, when pressed to update the public statement made on July 25, 2023, that a “significant” and “existing” customer who had agreed to use two different kinds of implementations at the “1,000 amp level” would ramp up in Q4, Vicor essentially denied the existence of any such customer and pivoted to talk about no specific customer, disclosing only that it was “having substantial conversations with customers who will diversify us away from the two big guys we’ve been doing business with.” In other words, in a mere three-month span, Vicor went from representing that one of the “two big guys” was ramping up a new product with Vicor by Q4 2023, to Vicor talking to other customers so as to not rely on business with the “two big guys.” This corrective disclosure made clear to Plaintiffs and the market that the promised Q4 “ramp in” of a “significant customer” was false when made; investors fled. As seen in the above figure, the price for Vicor immediately fell over 20%. Vicor closed at $53.19 on October 24, 2023. Following the after-hours earnings call, Vicor opened the next day at $39.01. Whereas the number of shares trading on the days prior to October 24, 2023, was consistent with the average of around a million, the volume again approached 4.5 million shares on October 25, 2023 (as people exited), and then reverted to the mean days later. After this lawsuit was filed, Vicor issued a press release to further attempt to cover its tracks. In its statement, Vicor seemingly admitted what it had denied on October 24, 2023—that it had said there was a large customer. Vicor’s press release proceeded to explain that its July 25, 2023 announcement was true because it had just “booked” $30 million in “non-cancellable, non-returnable” orders from the customer, and was a “reflect[ion]” of what Vicor “understood to be” the customer’s “allocation for a new program.” The press release confounds more than it explains. The fact that the press release was released a year after the events in question and only because lawsuits had been filed itself is a basis to read the carefully selected verbiage very closely and with extreme skepticism. The details (if they can be called that) should have been disclosed a year before it was made—e.g., between July 25, 2023 and October 24, 2023, or at least as part of the July 25, 2023 call. The fact that they were not is telling. The fact that the July 25, 2023, announcement that Vicor had landed a significant customer for its new product was predicated on nothing more than Vicor’s subjective” understanding of the “customer’s plans—and not its actual purchases of product—is likewise telling. Had Vicor truly “booked” $30 million in sales for its new product in or around July 25, 2023, it naturally would have filed an SEC Form 8-K to announce such a material development. It did not do so. And once Vicor made the oral announcement on July 25, 2023, it should have filed an SEC Form 8-K announcing the “customer’s” decision to reverse the $30 million in supposedly “Non-Cancellable, Non-Returnable orders.” The only reason it would not have done so at that time is because the reversal was not a reversal at all. The fact that no 8-K was filed and Vicor tried to cover up that fact in its July 25 announcement goes to Vicor’s knowledge and scienter of the falsity that there was a confirmed customer for those orders. The September 3, 2024 press release attempts to suggest that the bookings were real and non-cancellable, yet it never says when they were actually made, and publicly available court documents reveal no filing of a lawsuit for breach of a $30 million purchase order or supply agreement. Finally, nowhere did Vicor even attempt to address the real problem—its announcement on the July 2023 call that an existing customer had entered into a new contract for product from Vicor set to start delivering in Q4 2023 had no factual basis.",

      "summary": "Plaintiff Steamfitters Local 449 Pension & Retirement Security Funds (“Plaintiff”) brings this federal securities class action against SunPower Corporation (“SunPower” or the “Company”) and two of its former officers, Peter Faricy and Manavendra S. Sial (“Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of SunPower during the period from August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and who suffered damages as a result of the conduct alleged herein. SunPower is a solar energy company that delivers complete solar solutions to customers primarily in the United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options, as well as “Smart Energy” solutions. The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of solar energy generation, storage, and use products and services in what is called the downstream “Distributed Generation” or “DG” residential (often referred to as “resi”) and commercial markets. At the start of the Class Period, the Company divided its business into three main segments: Residential, Light Commercial (“RLC”); Commercial and Industrial Solutions (either “CIS” or “C&I,” sometimes described as the large or heavy commercial portion of the business); and “Others.” SunPower, and the financial analysts that follow the Company, frequently referred to the “light commercial” portion of SunPower’s RLC business as “Light Commercial Value-Added Reseller” or “CVAR.” The quality of SunPower’s products, which SunPower warrants, and SunPower’s “leadership” in the commercial market, were important points of differentiation for the Company. On April 19, 2021, Defendant Faricy became CEO, President and a member of SunPower’s Board of Directors. During the Class Period, beginning with the Company’s reporting of its 2Q21 financial results on August 3, 2021, Defendants allegedly falsely asserted (or omitted to state facts necessary to make the statements not misleading), among other things, that the Company’s commercial business was performing well and was currently on track for the Company to meet its financial guidance. On August 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s financial results and guidance. During the call, Sial also allegedly falsely told investors that the heavy commercial or CIS business was performing well, in particular representing that the commercial segment’s margin performance was “significantly better.” The next day, on August 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Form 10-Q allegedly falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective. On October 5, 2021, Defendants held a conference call to announce that they were exploring “strategic options” for the CIS business segment, indicating that Defendants were considering selling it. Defendants nevertheless continued to tout the ongoing strength of SunPower’s commercial business and affirmed that CIS was indeed “a point of strength” and “very healthy.” On November 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s 3Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Faricy allegedly falsely described the state of the Company’s operations and balance sheet. On November 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. Like the quarterly report for 2Q21, the 3Q21 Form 10-Q allegedly falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective. Each of the above representations concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial guidance; and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components was allegedly materially false and misleading when made because Defendants knew or deliberately disregarded and failed to disclose the following facts: (a) cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems had already developed in nearly all of the Company’s commercial systems; (b) as a result of the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems, SunPower would be required to incur tens of millions in costs to replace those defective third-party components; and (c) in light of (a) and (b) above, SunPower was not on track to achieve its FY21 financial guidance. Throughout the Class Period, the Company’s stock price traded at artificially inflated prices as high as $34.61. Based on Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions, investors expected that the Company’s commercial business was and would continue to be a key driver of revenue and margin growth, and that the Company’s financial results would not be negatively affected by already existing product defects. The artificial inflation of the Company’s stock price was maintained by Defendants’ continued boasting of the strength of the commercial business, as the truth about the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems remained concealed from the investing public. On December 7, 2021, SunPower published to its website the latest edition of its manual for Safety and Installation Instructions for the United States and Canada. The manual contained newly added language concerning cracking in connectors not present in the 2019 or 2020 editions of the United States and Canada manual. In addition, the December 7, 2022 manual added new advisories concerning best practices for safely handling connectors, such as: “For connectors, which are accessible to untrained people, it is imperative to use the locking connectors and safety clips, if applicable, in order to defend against untrained personnel disconnecting the modules once they have been installed.”; “Avoid exposure of electrical connections to direct sunlight and do not place the connector in a location where water could easily accumulate.” After December 7, 2021, the Company’s stock price continued to trade at artificially inflated prices above $18 per share. Then, on January 20, 2022, SunPower issued a press release preannouncing that it would miss its earnings guidance for 4Q21 and FY21 and expected approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 due to “cracking” problems in products across its commercial business segments. The release also noted that SunPower, no doubt in response, had hired a new executive to oversee the Company’s supply chain. Following SunPower’s January 20, 2022 preannouncement, financial analysts were quick to report on the scope and timing of the problem. “Nearly all” of SunPower’s commercial solar systems were affected, which would cost an estimated $31 million and require replacement throughout 2022. Importantly, analysts reported that Defendants must have learned about the pervasive problem of cracking in third-party components in conducting due diligence pursuant to selling the CIS business segment, if not earlier. In response to the aftermarket January 20, 2022 disclosures, SunPower’s stock price declined from a close of $19.02 on January 20, 2022, to $15.80 on January 21, 2022, a 16.9% drop, on more than 11.4 million shares trading volume as compared to only 2.8 million shares traded on January 20, 2022. Members of the putative class seek to recover their economic losses as a result of the conduct alleged herein.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"ImmunityBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of immunotherapies to treat cancer and other infectious diseases. Immunotherapies refer to a broad class of drugs that complement or stimulate the body’s immune system to fight disease, like cancer, and have become increasingly common in the field of oncology in recent years, particularly in combination with standard cancer therapies. ImmunityBio’s lead product candidate is a compound known as N-803 marketed under the trade name Anktiva. As it currently exists, ImmunityBio was formed in connection with a business combination between a separate entity by the name of ImmunityBio, Inc. (“Legacy ImmunityBio”) and NantKwest, Inc. (“NantKwest”) in March 2021. At the time of this business combination, both companies were majority owned by entities controlled by Defendant Soon-Shiong and was, effectively, a merger between two of the many businesses within his family of companies. Defendant Soon-Shiong is a former surgeon, scientist, biotech mogul, and media tycoon known for his ownership of the Los Angeles Times and his interest in the Los Angeles Lakers. He achieved fantastic success approximately twenty years ago inventing and bringing to market a novel cancer treatment known as Abraxane. In 1998, his start-up, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (“APP”), acquired Fujisawa USA and used its ties to hospital buyer groups to generate revenues from Fujisawa’s money-losing portfolio of injectable generic drugs, which, in turn, APP used to develop Abraxane. APP went public in 2001. In 2005, the FDA approved Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer. Following a merger with American BioScience, Inc., Soon-Shiong split the company into Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (“Abraxis BioScience”), which focused on Abraxane and other proprietary products, and APP Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“APP Pharmaceuticals”), which focused on the injectables business. In 2008, he sold APP Pharmaceuticals to Fresenius SE for approximately $5.6 billion. In 2010, he sold Abraxis BioScience to Celgene for approximately $3.6 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved Abraxane for the treatment of several other forms of cancer. By 2019, Abraxane was generating over $1 billion in annual sales. In 2011, Soon-Shiong was free to pursue his other interests and formed NantWorks LLC (“NantWorks”), among other ventures, to do so. It now serves as a holding company for a collection of healthcare, technology, and finance companies. In November 2014, Soon-Shiong formed Legacy ImmunityBio as a NantWorks subsidiary under the name NantBioCell, LLC to focus on next generation cancer immunotherapies. It later changed its name to Legacy ImmunityBio in May 2019. For ease of reference, all predecessors to Legacy ImmunityBio will be referred to herein as Legacy ImmunityBio. Soon-Shiong’s interest in NantKwest began around the same time that he formed Legacy ImmunityBio. In December 2014, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company by the name ConKwest, Inc. (“ConKwest”) announced that Soon-Shiong made a $48 million investment in its business. At the time, ConKwest was developing a proprietary line of enhanced natural killer cells for off-the-shelf commercialization. Soon-Shiong quietly assumed the title of Chief Medical Officer and CEO between January and March 2015. He made another $71 million investment in June 2015. In July 2015, ConKwest changed its name to NantKwest and commenced an IPO at a market valuation of $2.6 billion. Upon completing the IPO, Soon-Shiong and/or entities his affiliates owned over 60% of NantKwest. Soon after NantKwest went public, Soon-Shiong began to court Altor BioScience Corporation (“Altor”) after learning that it was developing several compounds that act on cytokines which help regulate the immune system, including a cytokine fusion protein known as ALT-803. Throughout early 2016, Soon-Shiong worked closely with Altor to bring their products into a cancer research coalition he created. In April 2016, he was named Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. By the end of 2016, entities controlled by Soon-Shiong had acquired over 50% of the equity in Altor. At the time Soon-Shiong took majority control of Altor, ALT-803 was being evaluated in several late-stage Phase 2 trials for various forms of cancer, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (“NMIBC”). In May 2017, ALT-803 received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in combination with a standard cancer vaccine, baccilus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”), based on the data generated in Phase 1 clinical trials. The FDA’s Fast Track program is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions, like cancer, and fill unmet medical needs. In or around July 2017, Legacy ImmunityBio acquired Altor, including its lead cytokine-based therapeutic compound, ALT-803, and continued to develop it under the name N-803. At the time, a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG had just begun in BCG unresponsive patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC. In December 2019, N-803 in combination with BCG received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NMIBC in patients who were unresponsive to BCG based on interim data indicating that the primary endpoint of the Phase 2 trial was already met mid-study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and preliminary clinical evidence shows a substantial improvement over available therapy. By August 2020, N-803 was known internally as Anktiva. Since its IPO in 2015, NantKwest experienced a number of setbacks and had not materially progressed its proprietary line of natural killer cell therapies. With Anktiva moving much faster through the clinical development and regulatory process, Soon-Shiong decided to use NantKwest as the vehicle to take Legacy ImmunityBio and its product portfolio public. On December 21, 2020, the two companies issued a joint press release announcing that they agreed to merge in a stock-for-stock merger. That same day, Legacy ImmunityBio announced that preliminary data from the Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG showed that the study already achieved its primary endpoint for patients with in situ forms of NMIBC. The Legacy ImmunityBio-NanktKwest merger closed on March 9, 2021. In connection with the transaction, a subsidiary of NanktKwest merged with and into Legacy ImmunityBio, and NanktKwest changed its name to ImmunityBio. It assumed the assets of Legacy ImmunityBio, including Anktiva, and its publicly traded shares continued to be listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol IBRX as of March 10, 2021. Immediately following the closing of the transaction, Defendant Soon-Shiong or affiliates controlled by him beneficially owned approximately 82% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Before a new drug can be introduced into interstate commerce for commercial purposes, it must be approved by the FDA. The FDA’s rules and regulations distinguish between chemically-synthesized drugs, known as “small molecule” drugs, and therapies derived from living material, known as “biologics.” In contrast to small molecule drugs, the means used to request FDA approval for a biologic, like Anktiva, is a biologic license application (“BLA”). The contents of a BLA must conform to strict guidelines outlined in FDA rules and associated guidance. Generally speaking, a BLA includes data and supporting materials collected in clinical trials, along with other information needed for the FDA to determine that the product meets prescribed standards for approval, including information on the manner in which the product is manufactured. In practice, a new BLA is a voluminous compendium of materials, and usually includes raw study data, historic records, written summaries, and academic literature, among other things, organized using a specific format adopted by the FDA. The section of the BLA that describes the manufacturing process and integrity of the drug is known as the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) section of the BLA. Unlike small molecule drugs, biologics are structurally complex materials that are not clearly defined or characterized. The process used to manufacture these materials at scale involves an array of highly technical steps, each of which must be carefully controlled to ensure a consistent final product free from impurities. Accordingly, the CMC section contains extensive information on the overall process, including, among other things, a full description of the manufacturing processes from start to finish, in-process controls used at each step, analytical methods used to test the product for release at various stages, and stability testing to show that the product remains true to form at regular intervals following final release, along with supporting documentation for each. The CMC section of the BLA not only describes the proposed process and protocols for manufacturing at scale, but also must include data generated in connection with previously-produced process performance qualification (“PPQ”) batches using the stated manufacturing processes and equipment. The purpose of such a qualification study is to validate that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of reproducing results within predetermined specifications at commercial scale. Importantly, the FDA is not authorized to approve a BLA unless it can determine from the materials submitted that the manufacturing process complies with cGMP. cGMP refers to the collection of minimum procedures and practices set forth in FDA regulations, codified primarily at 21 C.F.R. §§ 210-11, that companies must follow to ensure that the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs is well-controlled. The FDA has stated that these standards and practices assure the “identity, strength, quality, and purity” of drugs and prevent “contamination, mix-ups, deviations, failures, and errors.” Any drug manufactured using systems that fail to comply with these well-known and long-standing cGMP regulations are deemed “adulterated,” subjecting the party who is responsible for the failure to adverse regulatory action. Once submitted, the time for the FDA to act on the BLA is governed by various rules. In the first instance, the FDA will decide within 60 days if the BLA is sufficiently complete to “file” it for substantive review. If the FDA decides to file a BLA, the deadline for the FDA to act on it is determined by the goal dates set forth in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended (“PDUFA”). The version of PDUFA in effect at the time of the Anktiva BLA (PDUFA VI) directed the FDA to act on 90% of new BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day “filing” date, unless the BLA is designated as a “priority” submission which truncates the timeline to 6 months from the 60-day “filing” date. Development programs that receive Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations are ordinarily eligible for, although not automatically entitled to, priority review under PDUFA. As part of the review process, the FDA will also conduct a “pre-license inspection” of each facility used to manufacture the drug at a prescheduled time during the review period. The purpose of this inspection is to ensure that the facilities comply with applicable regulations, including cGMP. Any cGMP failures identified during the inspection can prevent the issuance of a license for the product. Pre-license inspections follow a standard protocol. Staff carry out their responsibilities not only by observing the site in operation but also by reviewing appropriate records at the facility reflecting past activities. Given the significance of this visit, many manufacturers hold mock inspections, perform cGMP audits, or otherwise shore up compliance gaps in advance of the FDA review period to minimize the risk for any adverse observations. After completing its review, the FDA will either approve the BLA or send the sponsor a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL outlines any issues identified by the FDA during the review that prevent approval of the BLA in its current form and, where possible, recommend actions that a sponsor may take to remedy the issues or otherwise position the application for approval. Upon receipt of a CRL, the applicant may resubmit the BLA with amendments to address the stated deficiencies or withdraw it. ImmunityBio Actively Planned to File a BLA for Anktiva by No Later Than the Start of the Class Period As noted above, ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva in July 2017 upon completing its acquisition of Altor. At the time of that acquisition, Altor had recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for N-803 with BCG in BCG unresponsive patients with in situ and papillary forms of NMIBC. By early December 2020, ImmunityBio learned from interim data that the Phase 3 trial of Anktiva with BCG already achieved its primary endpoint for patients with in situ forms of NMIBC with no treatment-related adverse events. Thus, by no later than December 2020, ImmunityBio knew that it was reasonably likely that the Company would file a BLA for Anktiva upon final completion of the study. Indeed, in the release announcing the initial results on December 21, 2020, Soon-Shiong stated “[w]e expect to file a Biologics License Application following a meeting with the FDA in 2021,” likely a reference to a “pre-BLA” meeting during which ImmunityBio can gain input from the FDA on the content and format of an anticipated BLA. In fact, the release included the following headline: “Biologics License Application anticipated in second half of 2021.” This precipitated a flurry of activity in 2021. On or around August 11, 2021, ImmunityBio appointed Soon-Shiong to the newly-created position of Global Scientific and Medical Officer. In this new role, Soon-Shiong assumed responsibility for clinical development. On September 13, 2021, ImmunityBio issued a press release disclosing that updated data from the Phase 3 study of Anktiva with BCG continued to show favorable data with no treatment-related adverse events in the in situ cohort. Then, at the end of November 2021, ImmunityBio submitted a briefing document to the FDA with updated data from that study. Such briefing material must be submitted to the FDA at least one month before a pre-BLA meeting. ImmunityBio subsequently had discussions with the FDA about its forthcoming BLA. On December 17, 2021, NantCapital, LLC, a Soon-Shiong investment vehicle, provided $300 million in financing to ImmunityBio. The release announcing this stated that the financing came directly “from ImmunityBio’s founder . . . Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong.” In addition, the release stated that the Company “anticipates a BLA filing . . . in Q1, 2022” and noted that recent financing would be used to “expand our commercial operations in anticipation of our bladder cancer BLA filing in Q1, 2022.” On May 23, 2022, ImmunityBio announced that it submitted a BLA to the FDA for Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive patients with the in situ form of NMIBC. The BLA included the results of previous clinical studies in that population, including the recently completed Phase 3 study, as well as at least three previously-completed PPQ runs for Anktiva at the facility where Anktiva was made. ImmunityBio requested priority review of the BLA. The FDA accepted the BLA for filing in late July 2022, and assigned it a target PDUFA date of May 23, 2023. In other words, the FDA put the BLA on a standard 10 month review. The Individual Defendants Were Well-Aware of the Critical Role That cGMP Compliance Played in Securing BLA Approval Like most anyone with a working knowledge of the FDA approval process, much less seasoned biotech executives, the Individual Defendants were well-aware of the FDA’s cGMP regulations at all relevant times. On January 29, 2021, Defendants Soon-Shiong and Adcock acknowledged in regulatory filings made with the SEC that any manufacturing facility for products that it develops are subject to “all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements, including cGMP,” and specified that “cGMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation.” The Individual Defendants, including Defendant Sachs, continued to make the same, or substantially similar, statements in each annual report on Form 10-K filed on behalf of ImmunityBio during the Class Period. Throughout the Class Period, the Individual Defendants also knew demonstrating compliance with cGMP was mission critical to securing approval from the FDA for a new biologic product, like Anktiva. In the same regulatory filings referenced above, the Individual Defendants admitted that “[t]he FDA will not approve an application [BLA] unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities comply with cGMP requirements.” In this regard, the Individual Defendants were privy to the fact that the FDA makes its cGMP assessment based not only on the manufacturing data that must be included in a BLA but also on the results of an in-person inspection of the facility while in use during the review period. In the same regulatory filings referenced above, the Individual Defendants advised that a “BLA/NDA must include . . . detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling,” including “quality control documentation” generated by the facility that manufactures the product and that “[m]anufacturing facilities must submit to pre-approval inspections by the FDA that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications, including our BLAs” to demonstrate that they are compliant with cGMP. Indeed, they specified that the purpose of such inspections was to “assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidates’ continued safety, quality, purity and potency.” At the time ImmunityBio acquired the rights to Anktiva from Altor, its production was outsourced to a predecessor of AGC Biologics, Inc. (“AGC”), a third-party CMO that provided manufacturing services for protein therapies which was recently acquired by Asahi Glass Company. Indeed, just two months earlier, in April 2017, Altor entered into a manufacturing agreement with that CMO to manufacture Anktiva for use in upcoming Phase 3 trials. At the time, Defendant Soon-Shiong was Chairman of Altor’s Board of Directors. Following a corporate reorganization in January 2018, that CMO was renamed AGC. Upon acquiring Altor, ImmunityBio continued to rely on AGC to manufacture Anktiva. As CW1 explained, AGC “originated” the technology for producing the active ingredient in Anktiva and, thus, it would be exceedingly expensive and risky to transfer that technology in-house, particularly with Phase 3 clinical trials recently started. This was echoed by CW2, who observed it would be “extremely difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to switch to another manufacturer at that point.” By the start of the Class Period in March 2021, AGC manufactured the bulk drug substance for Anktiva. In contrast to a final drug product, which includes both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials used for delivery, appearance, or taste, e.g., tablet coating, saline solution, etc., drug substance refers strictly to the active pharmaceutical ingredient. According to CW2, once released by AGC quality personnel"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Plaintiffs are three funds that purchased RTX during the Class Period. Defendant RTX is an aerospace and defense company, with three principal business segments, including jet engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. Defendant Gregory Hayes served as RTX’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) from April 2020 to May 2024. Defendant Neil Mitchill has served as RTX’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) since April 2021. Defendant Anthony F. O’Brien was RTX’s CFO from March 2015 through April 2021. Defendant Christopher T. Calio has served as RTX’s President and CEO since May 2024. Prior to his appointment as CEO of RTX, Calio was Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of RTX and former President of Pratt & Whitney. Defendant Shane G. Eddy has served as President of Pratt & Whitney since March 2022. RTX formed on April 3, 2020, via a $121 billion merger between Raytheon Corporation (“RTN”), a major United States defense contractor and industrial manufacturing corporation, and United Technologies Corporation (“UTC”), an aerospace conglomerate specializing in commercial aircraft engine manufacturing and aerospace systems. Pratt & Whitney is a former UTC subsidiary. After the merger, Pratt & Whitney became a business segment of RTX. Pratt & Whitney’s business focuses on designing, manufacturing, and servicing its product lines of jet engines for commercial and military aircraft. Pratt & Whitney’s commercial aircraft engine division is the second largest in the world, boasting a 35% market share as of 2020. Pratt & Whitney is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) that produces commercial jet engines and sells them to aircraft manufacturers. These aircraft manufacturers, most prominently Airbus, deliver the aircraft—equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines—to commercial carriers such as Delta, Spirit, and JetBlue for operation. Pratt & Whitney earns a significant portion of its revenue by providing Aftermarket MRO sales and services for its engines after they are in use by operators. Pratt & Whitney derives most of its profit from these Aftermarket MRO sales and services because its development and manufacturing costs are high and often result in the engine being sold at an initial loss. Pratt & Whitney is critical to RTX’s business. In 2022, Pratt & Whitney accounted for approximately 30% of RTX’s total net sales, bringing in $20.5 billion in revenue. Of Pratt & Whitney’s $20.5 billion in total net sales, roughly $11.5 billion came from its commercial engines business. Pratt & Whitney’s most significant product suite, by far, was its GTF engine family. Pratt & Whitney launched the GTF program in 2008 after investing $10 billion to develop the engine. The first GTF engine, the PW1100G (GTF 30k) variant, entered service in 2016. PW1100G engines primarily power the Airbus A320neo aircraft family—which are among the most produced commercial jet airliners across the world. Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engines also power the Airbus A220 aircraft family through the PW1500G (GTF 24k) models, and the Embraer E2 family through the PW1900G (GTF 24k) models. Leading up to and throughout the Class Period, the GTF engine was the centerpiece of Pratt & Whitney’s growth strategy. The GTF was seen as a “a watershed in the history of aircraft propulsion,” and thus quickly became “the most important development shaping [Pratt & Whitney’s] future success.” This was because “Pratt & Whitney promised that jetliners equipped with the GTF would achieve a 16% reduction in fuel consumption, a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and a 75% reduction in noise.” These were previously unheard-of improvements in the jet engine industry. Standard turbofan engines—predecessors to the GTF engines—have been on the market for many years. These engines work through a series of air ingestion, compression, combustion, and expulsion. The engine’s front fan draws in air and feeds it into the compressor. There, a series of blades compress the air and channel it into the combustor, also called its burner. In the combustor, injection nozzles create a mix of fuel and compressed air that burns at a temperature of approximately 1,700 degrees Celsius. The ultra-hot combustion gases flow at a high pressure and temperature into the engine’s turbine, where they are converted into mechanical energy. The combusted gases are then accelerated in a thrust nozzle and expelled, which propel the aircraft. A turbofan engine’s turbine is a critical part of the jet propulsion system because it drives the compressor and generates thrust. The turbine contains many blades and disks that are connected through a shaft and rotate. The turbine is divided into HPT and low-pressure turbine (“LPT”) sections. The HPT drives the high-pressure compressor, while the LPT drives the low-pressure combustor and the fan that generates the bulk of the engine’s thrust. Notably, the turbine is part of the engine’s “hot section” and exposed to blistering temperatures by being situated near the engine’s combustor. Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engine represented an industry “breakthrough,” because, unlike traditional turbofan engines, it had a gearbox between the fan and combustor that allowed the two sections of the engine to function at different, purportedly optimal, speeds. Specifically, the front fan spins slower to maximize air intake, while the core compressor and turbine operate at a faster speed to improve thrust. These design improvements were meant to enable the GTF engine to generate higher thrust while also burning less fuel. The industry quickly heralded Pratt & Whitney’s innovation on the GTF engine. Delta’s CEO Richard Anderson touted that Pratt & Whitney’s “geared turbofan is really the first true innovation since the Boeing 787 Dreamliner,” which was introduced into commercial service nearly a decade earlier, in 2009. Due to its revolutionary design and fuel efficiency, demand for the GTF engine was overwhelming. By the end of 2018—just three years into its manufacture—Pratt & Whitney had already received more than 10,000 orders and commitments for its GTF engines. A slide from a Pratt & Whitney’s March 2018 investor presentation illustrated the importance of the GTF engine to Pratt & Whitney’s business model, and demonstrated that GTF engines were expected to soon dwarf all other Pratt & Whitney commercial engines in the market combined. The Company’s SEC filings and investor communications repeatedly described the GTF engine as “the architecture of the future” and a “huge driver of growth,” that would “get [RTX] back to [its] historic level of margins.” As the Company’s 2019 annual report boasted: Pratt & Whitney continues to set the industry standard for performance. Its GTF (geared turbofan) engine is the quietest, cleanest and most fuel-efficient engine in its class. Demand for the GTF engine is strong with more than 10,000 firm and option orders at the end of 2019. Approximately 1,400 GTF engines are in service across six continents. During the year 14 airlines took their first GTF-powered aircraft, including Wizz Air, Cebu Pacific and JetSMART. Current customers, such as GoAir and JetBlue, announced additional GTF orders. GTF engines have saved operators more than $550 million in fuel and more than 2.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions since the engine’s entry into service. The GTF engine’s revolutionary geared turbofan architecture allows for further evolution and performance enhancements. As Defendant Calio explained during a May 18, 2021 investor call, the GTF was soon expected to account for 60% of all of Pratt & Whitney’s sales. Defendant Calio specifically remarked that the GTF engine “is going to be the huge driver of growth in this business,” and stated that while, in 2019, the GTF was “15%, 20% - little north of 20% of our sales in the large commercial engine business,” it would “be close to 60% when we get to 2025[.]” The way RTX generates revenue on its GTF engines is linked to their time “on wing” or in flight. This is because RTX’s GTF engines are initially sold at a loss, resulting from the high investment needed to design and build the engines. RTX frequently acknowledged this point during the Class Period. For example, during a February 23, 2022 investor conference, Defendant Hayes stated, with respect to the GTF program, “we still lose money on every single engine.” Because initial sales of GTF engines are not profitable, RTX recoups its losses and generates this “cash flow” or profit through commercial Aftermarket MRO sales and services related to already-installed engines. However, RTX can only begin charging for Aftermarket MRO once the GTF engine has been in service long enough for its initial warranty to expire—typically up to five years. During the warranty period, Pratt & Whitney does not charge the operator for Aftermarket MRO services. RTX had a strong incentive to “ramp up” its production volume of GTF engines to get them to market as quickly as possible, in order to bring the fleet closer to generating cash flow from its Aftermarket MRO services. Due to how important Aftermarket MRO profits were to the GTF program, Defendants emphasized to investors that they closely monitored the engine’s performance—i.e., its ability to stay in the air—“every single day, every single hour.” On September 12, 2019, an analyst inquired, “on the GTF, what do you think is the biggest risk in getting that aftermarket goodness over the next 10, 20, 30 years?” Defendant Hayes responded, “[w]e know, for instance, how long a turbine is going to last . . . we monitor these [engines] every single day, every single hour that they’re operating. So we can see when they’re going to come out of service.” It was critical to RTX’s profitability that it not only sell as many of the GTF engines into service as quickly as possible, but that the Company keep the engines in service until their warranty periods expired so that RTX could start earning profit through its Aftermarket MRO business. In a frantic effort to get the GTF engines into commercial service, Pratt & Whitney cut corners in its manufacturing, which produced aircraft engines with a host of manufacturing defects. As Pratt & Whitney struggled to ramp up production of its GTF engines to meet increasing levels of demand, its quality control suffered. Consequently, in the years leading up to the Class Period, Pratt & Whitney’s faulty quality control led to GTF engines being plagued by a series of defects. As part of its strategy to ramp up production volume and get the GTF engine to market quickly, numerous former employees of RTX detailed how the Company knowingly compromised manufacturing quality and, in turn, flight safety. The FEs highlight how RTX’s push to get the GTF engines to market was tied to its need to begin logging flight hours on the engines to bring them closer to profitability. For example, according to FE-8, a Manufacturing Engineering Manager, Pratt & Whitney “pushed production over everything.” FE-8 stated that Pratt & Whitney sent customers GTF 30K engine parts with known defects because the Company was behind on production and needed to get certain parts “out the door.” FE-8 detailed that he was told by Elliott, Senior Operations Manager Mark White, Associate Director Maribel Rodriguez, former Vice President Deb Chipperfield and others that Pratt & Whitney needed to produce GTF 30K engine parts to customers even if there were known defects. FE-8 added that he left Pratt & Whitney partially because the company targeted “minimal spec” (i.e. specifications) when conducting investigations on engine parts. Similarly, FE-4, who worked with the Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine from 2018 to 2021, recalled that after he was moved from quality control to production, he felt pressure from his supervisors to get the GTF engine to market, even though there were problems with the engine. FE-4detailed that he and his colleagues were told to “hurry up” with the production of the GTF engine during this time. FE-4 noted that despite problems with the GTF engine, the engines were still delivered to Pratt & Whitney’s customers. FE-4 stated Pratt & Whitney was not making any money on the GTF engine during his tenure. FE-4 explained that Pratt & Whitney’s customers purchased the GTF aircraft from Airbus and that the GTF engine came with the Airbus aircraft. Therefore, according to FE-4, Pratt & Whitney made money by engine overhauls and servicing. However, FE-4 noted that all the GTF engine work that Pratt & Whitney did for its customers during his tenure was warranty work. FE-3 described quality problems affecting Pratt & Whitney’s GTF PW1100 engines, specifically the high-pressure turbine (“HPT”) and high-pressure compressor (“HPC”) disks, also referred to as hubs. He also described numerous other manufacturing quality issues impacting the GTF engine fleet, which were known by top management within the Company. He described the Company’s strong push to avoid delays and deliver the GTF engines on time, so as not to negatively affect customer relationships, despite these many quality issues. Specifically, FE-3 recalled that there was a “big push to get the GTF out” to market, adding that the priority and biggest push was getting the GTFs to Airbus. He also described how the Company was sensitive to these issues because they knew disclosing them would impact shareholders or investors. Other former employees described a change in procedure in order to get more GTF engines out the door. For example, according to FE-7, a former Manufacturing Engineer at Pratt & Whitney, engine fan blades are typically developed for two years and then manufactured. However, FE-7 stated that Pratt & Whitney developed the GTF engine fan blades at the same time they were manufacturing them because it wanted to get them out to its customers. FE-7 stated that the quality of these parts was “poor” compared to where it should be because Pratt & Whitney wanted to get the GTF engine to market. Former employees also explained that Pratt & Whitney tried to keep the manufacturing issues secret and, worse, that many of the engineering fixes were not working. For example, FE-10 recalled that employees were instructed not to divulge publicly any details about the engine’s problems or efforts to fix them. Moreover, FE-10 elaborated that he knew that the Company’s internal numbers regarding the number of affected engines were very high, and that the initial engineering “fixes” for the problem were not working, so the costs were much higher than initially anticipated. FEs also recall that, as part and parcel of its push to get the GTF engine to market quickly, RTX implemented a policy from its highest level of cutting manufacturing costs at the expense of quality control and the safety of the GTF engine family. For example, FE-2 indicated that he was aware of the quality control issues at Pratt & Whitney which led to the recall of the GTF series of engines. FE-2 advised that the quality control problems were caused by changes in the Company’s procurement process; specifically, the Company switched from reliable suppliers to much less expensive suppliers to save money, but the materials sourced from the cheaper suppliers were much poorer in quality. FE-2 advised that the cost-cutting measures which forced Pratt & Whitney to switch to unqualified suppliers came from former RTX CEO Gregory Hayes. FE-2 noted that Hayes was recently replaced as CEO by Christopher Calio, and that Calio had also been responsible for creating the cost-cutting policies that led to the quality control problems. FE-2 noted that the Sourcing Team earned bonuses for achieving certain levels of cost savings. According to FE-2, Pratt & Whitney switched to less expensive suppliers shortly before the COVID pandemic; Company management forced the Sourcing Team to look for new, less expensive suppliers starting in 2018. FE-2 recalled that there was a directive from Pratt & Whitney’s president to find cost savings of approximately $1 billion. FE-2 added that this directive was issued to Pratt & Whitney’s president by the CEO of RTX, who instructed him to find cheaper suppliers “right now.” FE-2 noted that the Sourcing Team earned bonuses for achieving certain levels of cost savings. FE-2 indicated that the cost savings directive was communicated to him during regular SIOP process meetings. FE-2 reiterated that, after the switch to the cheaper suppliers, quality control problems increased. FE-2 commented that some of the new suppliers, most of which were overseas, “don’t even have a company” and were “building parts in their garage.” According to FE-2, RTX fired him for raising concerns about these issues. FE-3 recalled that Pratt & Whitney always internally pushed cost-cutting which he described as always a “priority.” According to FE-3, with the internal concerns over cost-cutting, potential costs of recalls, threatened contract cancellations, and not letting bad news make it to press, that Pratt & Whitney was focused on containing issues, and not fixing them. Contemporaneous news publications described early issues with the GTF engines attributable to Pratt & Whitney’s shoddy manufacturing. Throughout 2017 and 2018, dozens of Airbus A320neo planes with GTF engines experienced in-flight shutdowns or aborted takeoffs due to defects in a number of different components in the GTF engines, such as fan blades, turbine blades, and knife-edge seals. These component problems were so widespread that, in 2018, Airbus temporarily stopped taking delivery of new GTFs from Pratt & Whitney. FE-3 recalled that Pratt & Whitney’s customers— most notably Airbus, the Company’s key customer with the largest contract—were threatening to cancel their contracts if there were any more delays with the GTF engines. He first recalled hearing about these customers’ threats to pull contracts at work sometime in 2018. FE-3 recalled that the issue with the HPT and HPC parts were not rectified when his tenure at Pratt & Whitney ended. Many of these news articles caused the market to become concerned about whether and when the GTF would finally become profitable. As a March 15, 2018 Business Insider article explained, despite the GTF’s “game changer” technology, the engine’s progress in the market had been stalled, as “the engines have been plagued by a series of teething problems that have slowed aircraft deliveries, increased maintenance costs, and forced the Indian government to ground a fleet of planes.” Business Insider opined that “it looks as if we’ll have to wait a bit longer for this piece of newfangled equipment to hit its stride.” Leading up to the Class Period, analysts and investors were highly focused on the Company’s efforts to address these defects and turn the GTF program into long- term profits from Aftermarket MRO services and gain market share. In an April 8, 2020 report, RBC Capital Markets analysts took note of Pratt & Whitney’s “spending to address teething issues associated with the entry into service for the GTF.” While Pratt & Whitney was “still years away from positive FCF [free cash flow] on new GTF deliveries,” analysts at RBC expressed hope that “aftermarket revenues associated with the program should gradually build as the fleet expands,” such that “the GTF franchise will create value over decades.” RBC further stated its belief that “Pratt has overcome most of the technical issues that affected the engine during its first few years,” and noted that, now, “the key test for the GTF will be the share of new orders it is able to generate,” estimating that, if the defects were resolved, “Pratt & Whitney will capture ~45-50% of"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Danaher is a diversified global conglomerate organized around several strategic platforms. The Company is comprised of at least seventeen largely independent operating companies in the areas of Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Diagnostics. Danaher was founded in by brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales when they took over a real estate investment trust (REIT) left behind by their father, Norman Rales, as a vehicle for corporate takeovers. It quietly grew into an industrial giant through steady acquisitions and divestitures in different fields of business. It entered the life sciences sector with the acquisition of Leica Microsystems in . By 2015, the Company’s portfolio included approximately 40 companies across a range of reporting segments, including Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Dental, Test and Measurement, Environmental, and Industrial Technologies. At that time, Danaher generated approximately $19.9 billion in annual revenue, approximately 36% of which was collectively attributable to its Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolios. Beginning in 2015, the Company completed a series of blockbuster transactions to grow its Life Sciences segment. For example, in August 2015, it acquired Pall Corporation (“Pall”), a manufacturer of filtration, separation, and purification tools, for almost $14 billion. In March 2020, it also acquired General Electric Company’s biopharmaceutical support business, known as GE Life Sciences, for over $21 billion and renamed it “Cytiva.” Together, Pall and Cytiva broadened Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio to include a full suite of systems and products used to manufacture drugs derived from living materials, known as “biologics,” at all phases of the production process from cell culture through packaging, including “downstream” filtration in which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is separated from extraneous byproducts. In addition, in April 2019, the Company also acquired nucleic acid and genomic product pioneer, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (“IDT”), for approximately $2 billion. During this period, Danaher also took steps to expand its Diagnostics platform. Most notably, in November 2016, it acquired publicly-traded molecular testing company, Cepheid, for approximately $4 billion. Cepheid already had an established presence at healthcare institutions throughout the world as a result of its proprietary testing system, GeneXpert, which tests for pathogens and genetic disorders by placing a sample into a single use cartridge and loading it into a desktop machine that runs a fully-automated polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) test. Throughout this time, Danaher also exited several business areas to streamline the composition of its asset portfolio. For example, in connection with the Pall acquisition, Danaher spun off the businesses in its Test & Measurements and Industrial Technologies segments into a standalone, publicly-traded company named Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”). In addition, in late 2019, the Company also completed the spinoff of its Dental segment into an independent, publicly-traded company named Envista Holdings Corporation (“Envista”). By the start of 2020, Danaher transformed into a business with just three reporting segments: Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental and Applied Solutions (“EAS”). At that time, the Company generated approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, approximately 39% of which was attributable to its Life Sciences segment and approximately 37% of which was attributable to its Diagnostics segment. In other words, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics branches accounted for 76% of Danaher’s annual revenues, up from 36% at the start of 2015. On May 6, 2020, Danaher announced that it selected Defendant Rainer M. Blair, head of the Company’s Life Sciences platform, to succeed Thomas P. Joyce Jr. as CEO of Danaher. In his role as head of the Life Sciences portfolio, Blair led a number of key acquisitions, including Pall, IDT, and Cytiva, and oversaw the growth of the Life Sciences platform from a business generating approximately $2.4 billion in annual revenue in 2015 to approximately $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2019. According to CW1, and based on CW1’s role as leader in internal communications at Danaher, Defendant Blair wanted to develop Danaher into a brand leader in the life science and genomics space and set on a course to do so. In contrast to many other businesses that suffered from the sea change in consumer spending patterns, Danaher’s Diagnostic and Life Sciences segments were uniquely positioned to profit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, in vitro diagnostic tests, i.e., diagnostic tests that use samples taken from the human body, must be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) before they can be introduced into interstate commerce for commercial purposes. The FDA is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the HHS, Alex M. Azar II, determined that there was a public health emergency with the significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad related to the novel COVID-19 virus and, on that basis, decided that circumstances exist justifying emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for COVID-19. See 85 Fed. Reg. 7316 (Feb. 4, 2020). Under applicable law, this provided the FDA with the power to issue emergency use authorization (each an “EUA”) permitting the sale and use of unapproved tests for the diagnosis or detection of the virus causing COVID-19 under certain circumstances. Thus, the HHS Secretary’s February 4, 2020 EUA authorization provided a significant business opportunity for companies involved in the creation of such devices by providing a pathway to go directly to market with a product in very high demand without the need to engage in the costly steps of clinical development or traditional premarket regulatory approval. At the time of the HHS Secretary’s EUA authorization for COVID-19, IDT offered a selection of bespoke genomic products, including custom primers and probes used in PCR tests. In a PCR test, a “master mix” containing microscopic primers and probes with short sequences of DNA are introduced to a sample in a test vial (for example, material collected using a nose swab). If the sample contains DNA matching the sequences in the primers, the primers will drive a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, in which they make billions of copies of the sequences, and the DNA probes will make those sequences glow when used in specialized lab machines which can then detect and quantify the antigen in its amplified form. On approximately February 10, 2020, IDT released a COVID-19 primer and probe kit using DNA sequence specifications previously published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) for use in primers and probes as a product for companies interested in commercializing PCR tests pursuant to a potential FDA EUA. In addition, on March 2, 2020, primer and probe kits manufactured by IDT became the first to be approved for use by CDC-approved laboratories to assemble their own diagnostic tests pursuant to a protocol for doing so developed by the CDC which previously received EUA by the FDA. By March 23, 2020, IDT shipped COVID-19 primer and probe kits with capacity to perform more than 10 million tests. As of May 2020, that number snowballed to 30 million tests. Later that month, IDT opened a manufacturing facility in North Carolina to keep up with demand for its COVID-19 products and reduce lead times for customers on the east coast of the United States. By the time the CDC discontinued its test kit design protocol on December 31, due to the increased availability of higher-throughput alternatives by private enterprises, IDT was one of just two companies with primer and probe kits qualified under the CDC’s EUA. Furthermore, the DNA sequences published by the CDC proved to be so effective that they became the gold standard for primers and probes and continued to be widely used in diagnostic tests. Cepheid was also uniquely positioned to capitalize on the EUA authorization for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. New forms of disease can be detected with its existing GeneXpert systems by simply outfitting the single-use cartridges used therein with probes that contain genetic sequences specific to that disease. In addition, its desktop machines were already in use at point-of-care centers throughout the world, including hospitals. On February 10, 2020, Cepheid announced that it was developing a new molecular test for the detection of COVID-19 designed for use on its existing GeneXpert systems. Cepheid expressly stated that it “intends to access the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization pathway for regulatory approval and make the test available globally.” On March 20, 2020, the FDA granted EUA for a new molecular test developed by Cepheid to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, designed for use on its existing GeneXpert systems branded as Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. This EUA was the first for a rapid, point-of-care molecular test in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a press release by the FDA with statements by the HHS Secretary and the Commissioner of the FDA. Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 tests began shipping the following week. Cepheid received subsequent EUAs for related products. For example, on June 9, 2020, Cepheid announced that it was developing a similar four-in-one rapid diagnostic test for the detection SAORS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ahead of the upcoming flu season. On September 24, 2020, the FDA granted EUA for Cepheid’s proposed four-in-one test under the name Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV. As with Cepheid’s first EUA, this EUA was the first for a four-in-one test including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic not only increased demand for diagnostic tests but also for vaccines and therapeutics to treat the disease itself. By the end of March 2020, there were over 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. On March 27, 2020, HHS Secretary, Alex M. Azar II, decided that the public health emergency presented by COVID-19, previously announced on February 4, 2020, justified the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. See 85 Fed. Reg. 18250 (Mar. 27, 2020). As with the EUA authorization for in vitro diagnostic tests, this provided the FDA with the power to issue EUAs permitting the sale and use of unapproved drugs and biologics to treat COVID-19 under certain circumstances, thus providing another significant business opportunity for life sciences companies in the business of developing such product candidates. Within Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio, Cytiva and Pall provided equipment and services used by customers to develop and produce new biotherapeutic candidates, including vaccines, a business that Danaher referred to as its “bioprocessing” division. The vast majority of this division’s business came from large pharmaceutical companies with drugs in late-stage development or in full-scale commercial production, with the remaining portion coming from smaller biotechnology startup companies researching new product candidates in early-stage development. Throughout 2020 and 2021, many of these bioprocessing customers were racing to develop and produce vaccines and other therapeutics to treat COVID-19 throughout the world, and both Cytiva and Pall experienced a surge in demand for machinery, consumables, and services related thereto. By the end of 2021, Danaher was generating $29 billion in annual revenue across its three business segments, up from approximately $18 billion before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual sales in the Life Sciences segment grew from $6.95 billion in 2019 to $14.96 billion in 2021, and annual sales in the Diagnostics segment grew from $6.56 billion in 2019 to $9.84 billion in 2021. In other words, the sales growth in the Company’s Life Sciences and Diagnostic segments accounted for practically all of $11 billion in annual sales growth from 2019, before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, to 2021. Investors responded positively to the steady growth across Danaher’s portfolio during this tumultuous time. Danaher’s stock price skyrocketed from $121.39 per share on March 23, 2020, at the start of the pandemic, to close at a near all-time high of $329.01 per share on December 31, 2021. It closed at an all-time high of $332.43 per share on September 3, 2021. Defendants were fully aware that the COVID-19 pandemic propelled the Company’s explosive growth in 2020 and 2021. For example, on a call with analysts on September 9, 2021, Defendant Blair candidly recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic provided “momentum” and “tailwinds” for Danaher over the past 18 months and acknowledged that “[t]he pandemic tailwinds have allowed us to really accelerate organic growth investments across the portfolio,” particularly in businesses within its Diagnostics and Life Sciences segments, including, specifically, Cepheid and Cytiva. This was no secret. As Tycho Peterson, senior analyst for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., bluntly stated during a Danaher symposium for investors and analysts in September 2021, “[o]bviously, bioprocess has been a big COVID beneficiary.” Nevertheless, by the end of 2021, Defendants recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic would soon begin to taper off but formed the view that COVID-19 would evolve into an endemic disease rather than disappear altogether. For example, on December 1, 2020, Defendant Blair proclaimed: “Today, we’ve actually modified our hypothesis to say, we believe a post-pandemic world has COVID be[ing] endemic. In other words, COVID does not go away . . . but continues on.” According to the CDC, a disease is “endemic” when there is a “constant presence of a disease or infectious agent within a geographic area or population group.” For example, seasonal influenza is commonly referred to as an endemic disease. As such, Defendants began previewing that their expectations for Danaher in future reporting periods required them model business expectations without the benefit it received due to COVID-19 during the pandemic. For instance, on September 9, 2021, Defendant Blair told analysts that for purposes of modeling a “post-pandemic world . . . we’re taking all the momentum and the tailwinds that we see here in the shorter term out of that and really talking about what we think we can sustain” without those drivers. At this time, one of the largest components, if not the single largest component, of Danaher’s annual revenue was the bioprocessing business within its Life Sciences segment, a business that experienced a surge in business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2021, the bioprocessing business maintained by Cytiva and Pall was expected to generate $7.5 billion in annual revenue, or over one quarter of Danaher’s total annual revenue in 2021. Consequently, investors and the broader financial community remained intensely focused on the continued performance of the bioprocessing business. For example, as Evercore ISI senior analyst, Vijay Kumar, explained during an interview with Defendants Blair and McGrew on December 1, 2021, “I think biopharma, clearly, it’s front and center for investors.” Kumar justified asking several more questions on bioprocessing thereafter “just given it’s been such a key part of the business for you guys.” Similarly, on a January 27, 2021 call hosted by Danaher, Citigroup Inc. senior analyst, Patrick Bernard, advised that “the question, I think, we get the most from investors” was about “what the cadence could look like going forward” for bioprocessing. Analysts continued to pepper the Company with questions about the bioprocessing business on every single call hosted by Danaher throughout the Class Period and emphasized its importance to investors. For example, on March 8, 2022, Cowen and Company analyst Dan Brennan stated that “bioproduction” was the one area of the business “where I’ve got a number of questions” from investors. Likewise, on April 21, 2022, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar commented that “there’s been a lot of questions on the vaccine side and base bioprocessing.” Indeed, later on that same call, Dan Brennan reiterated that there was great “interest in kind of dissecting COVID at this point from investors” with respect to bioprocessing. Even as late as January 11, 2023, J.P. Morgan analyst Rachel Vatnsdal stated that “[b]ioprocessing is obviously an area of interest for most of us in the room.” Indeed, on October 24, 2023, immediately after the end of the Class Period, Dan Brennan commented again that there “remains, obviously, as you know, a tremendous amount of focus” on the bioprocessing business. Danaher has, historically, measured its progress against its strategic priorities based on several financial metrics, including its revenue growth. The Company receives revenue primarily from the sale of the products and services offered by the various businesses within its operating segments. Like most other public companies, Danaher purports to calculate its total revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Importantly, revenue is not recognized until control of the promised products or services is transferred to the customer. This is notable because lead times for products extended to well over a year during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as the global supply chain experienced myriad disruptions. As a business with global operations regularly involved in M&A activity, Danaher also used several non-GAAP metrics to track its performance, including a measure it referred to as “core revenues,” also known as “core sales.” Unlike revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP, this non-GAAP metric excludes (i) sales from newly-acquired businesses, and (ii) the impact of foreign exchange rates. Danaher claimed to use this metric because these two items can vary significantly from period-to-period, and, thus, obscure underlying business trends and period-to-period comparisons. From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 until the start of the Class Period in January 2022, Danaher reported its sales on a fully consolidated basis without separating out the sales directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Rather, Danaher continued to report its total sales in accordance with GAAP along with “core sales,” and, thus, presented its financial condition in a manner that included the favorable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as its various businesses benefited from the public health emergency. By the start of 2022, Defendants knew that sales attributable to COVID-19 testing would wane over the course of 2022 relative to the sales peak during the pandemic as the disease transitioned into an endemic state, and thereby yield declining year-over-year comparisons. Accordingly, Defendants decided to alter the manner in which the Company presented its financial information to the investing public to show that its underlying business was continuing to grow. On January 27, 2022, Danaher announced that, in addition to core revenue, it would also report a modified non-GAAP metric called “base business core revenue,” which took core revenue and excluded sales attributable to COVID-19 testing from its Diagnostics segment but still included sales attributable to products used to support COVID-19-related vaccines and therapeutics from its Life Sciences segment.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Lead Plaintiffs bring this securities class action on behalf of themselves and all others who sold Focus Financial Partners Inc. (“Focus” or the “Company”) common stock between February 27, 2023 and the closing of a merger (“Merger”) with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) on August 31, 2023 (the “Class Period”). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements in the Proxy Statement (“Proxy”) that Focus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on June 12, 2023. Plaintiffs allege that these false statements artificially depressed the price of Focus’ common stock, causing them to lose money when they sold their shares during the Class Period. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants’ false statements caused them to accept an unfair price in connection with the Merger. Focus is a Delaware corporation that was headquartered in New York, New York during the Class Period. Focus’ primary business involved owning and partnering with independent fiduciary wealth management firms in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) sector. It was publicly traded on the NASDAQ market until the August 2023 closing of the Merger, at which point it became a privately held company whose shares are predominantly owned by CD&R. The sale process leading to the Merger commenced in the summer of 2022, when Focus’ Board determined to explore available strategic options, including a potential sale. On November 1, 2022, the Board established a Special Committee to oversee the Merger process. The Special Committee consisted of four Focus Board members who were not members of management or affiliated with Stone Point. Defendant LeMieux was Focus’ Chairman at the time of the Merger. Defendants Neuhoff, Morganroth, and Feliciani were Focus directors at the time of the Merger. The Special Committee Defendants did not own any Focus Class A common stock. Focus’ Board consisted of eight members. In addition to the four Special Committee Defendants, the Board also included Defendants Adolf, Kodialam, Carey, and Muhtadie. Defendant Adolf was Focus’ CEO and Chairman of the Board at the time of the Merger. Defendant Kodialam was Focus’ COO and a Board member at the time of the Merger. Defendant Carey was Stone Point’s President and was a Managing Director of Stone Point at the time of the Merger. Carey was appointed to the Focus Board by Stone Point in 2018. Defendant Muhtadie was the purported “lead independent director” at Focus. He was Stone Point’s Co-Head of Private Equity and was a Managing Director of Stone Point at the time of the Merger. Muhtadie was appointed to the Focus Board by Stone Point in 2018. The Officer Defendants include Defendants Adolf and Kodialam, as well as Defendants Shanahan, Chang, and McGranahan. Defendant Shanahan was Focus’ Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) at the time of the Merger. Defendant Chang was a Senior Managing Director and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions at Focus at the time of the Merger. Defendant McGranahan was Focus’ General Counsel and Corporate Secretary at the time of the Merger. The Officer Defendants were not members of the Special Committee or the Board. Stone Point is a Delaware limited liability company that invests in the global financial services industry. At the time of the Merger, Stone Point was Focus’ single largest stockholder and owned approximately 20.6% of the outstanding equity and total shareholder voting power in Focus. CD&R is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in New York City. Founded in 1978, CD&R is a private equity firm with approximately $58 billion in assets under management. CD&R specializes in acquiring corporate divisions and family enterprises, as well as whole businesses from other private and public owners. Goldman Sachs is a New York limited liability company that served as a financial advisor to the Special Committee and also advised the Board in connection with the Merger. Jefferies is a Delaware limited liability company that served as a financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with the Merger. V&E is a law firm that served as outside legal counsel for Focus Financial in connection with the Merger. Potter Anderson is a law firm that served as outside legal counsel for the Special Committee in connection with the Merger. Lead Plaintiffs allege that the sale process leading to the Merger was plagued by conflicts of interest harbored by Stone Point (which was the Company’s largest shareholder and controlled at least half the Board), the Company’s executive management team, and the members of the Company’s Board—including the members of a purportedly-independent Special Committee ultimately appointed to oversee the Merger process. These insider conflicts of interest were, moreover, compounded by serious conflicts of interest harbored by the financial advisors engaged to assist with the process, who were more concerned with their own financial interests than with ensuring that any sale appropriately maximized value for Focus shareholders. The conflicts produced an utterly deficient sale process that benefited insiders but was inconsistent with maximizing value for Focus’ public shareholders. Plaintiffs also allege that the timing of the sale process was suspect. In the summer of 2022, Focus was operating from a position of strength as a standalone company and experiencing significant ongoing growth. It had no immediate need to explore a sale. At the outset of the process that would ultimately culminate in the Merger, Focus was specifically advised that it was not an ideal time for a sale. In a presentation to the Board delivered June 30, 2022, Goldman Sachs specifically informed the Board that it was then a “challenging market to execute a deal,” that there was “limited upside in engaging at this point,” and that Focus’ “stock/valuation remains under pressure.” Goldman Sachs further advised that signing a nondisclosure agreement (“NDA”) with a potential bidder “may create noise in market,” and that, in this “challenging financing market; why share info now; can engage later.” Ignoring this advice, the Board nevertheless undertook a process to sell Focus. Plaintiffs allege that the decision to commence a sale process in the bear market of Summer 2022 was not motivated by any business need or by the availability of any particularly attractive opportunity. Instead, the sale was motivated by Stone Point’s interests. Stone Point had several levers of influence that allowed it to drive the Company’s sale process. At the time of the Merger, Stone Point owned approximately 20.6% of Focus’ shareholder equity and voting power, making it the Company’s single largest shareholder and enabling it to exercise significant control over the direction of the Company. Pursuant to a Nominating Agreement executed in connection with the Company’s IPO, Stone Point was empowered to nominate two directors to the Board. Stone Point exercised this right to place Defendants Carey and Muhtadie—two of Stone Point’s Managing Directors—on Focus’ eight-member Board. The Nominating Agreement also empowered Stone Point to designate two of the three members of the Board’s Compensation Committee. Defendants Carey and Muhtadie were designated members of, and constituted two-thirds of, the Committee (with Defendant LeMieux serving as the third member). This gave Stone Point de facto control over all significant decisions concerning compensation of Focus’ senior executives and, therefore, gave Stone Point an extremely potent lever of influence over the members of the Company’s executive management team. Those executives included Focus’ CEO and COO, Adolf and Kodialam, both of whom were also members of the Board. This arrangement gave Stone Point significant control over those individuals and, combined with its own two Managing Directors serving on the Board, gave Stone Point direct control over at least four of the eight members of the Board at the time of Focus’ sale process and resulting Merger. As yet another lever of influence, Stone Point exercised a significant amount of power in the context of negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition through Focus’ First Lien Credit Agreement (the “Credit Document”), which the Company entered prior to its IPO. Section 11.11 of the Credit Document provided that a “Change of Control,” in which a third party acquired 35% or more of Focus’ voting stock, could trigger an “Event of Default” requiring the acceleration and repayment of Focus’ debt. In defining “Change of Control,” the Credit Document excluded “Permitted Holders” from those acquirors that would cause a change of control and trigger the acceleration provision. Permitted Holders included Stone Point and members of Focus’ management team. The definition also carved out situations where the “Permitted Holders have, at such time, the right or the ability by voting power, contract, or otherwise to elect or designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors of the Borrower.” The effect of this arrangement was to grant Stone Point a tremendous amount of power in negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition. If Stone Point and management did not agree to roll over equity into the surviving company, or if an acquiror did not grant Stone Point and management the right to elect a majority of the Board, then Focus’ debt would accelerate under the Credit Document. The acceleration of debt would require the acquiror to find a new source of debt at higher interest rates, increasing the cost of the acquisition for that acquiror. Plaintiffs allege that Stone Point and management could control the sale process, as they would need to agree on the counterparty and participate as an owner of the surviving company—and maintain board control—to ensure the portability of the Company’s debt, lowering costs for the potential acquiror. In theory, Stone Point should have been willing to partner with whichever counterparty offered the best deal for shareholders. But, from the outset, Stone Point acted instead to advance its own interests. Stone Point specifically acknowledged to Goldman Sachs that it was “not agnostic with respect to potential partners in an acquisition of the Company” and “expressed certain views on potential partners”—tipping its hand that it would use its levers of influence to favor potential acquirors that offered the best deal for Stone Point, regardless of whether it was also the best deal for the Company’s public shareholders. CD&R ultimately became Stone Point’s favored counterparty by promising to allow Stone Point to rollover some of its equity and invest new equity capital in Focus following the closing of the Merger. Stone Point also had a keen interest in a sale of Focus because Stone Point—along with the Officer Defendants and all members of Focus’ Board, other than Muhtadie and Carey (who themselves stood to benefit indirectly from Stone Point’s interest)—had the right to receive significant payments under Tax Receivable Agreements (“TRAs”) previously executed with the Company. In 2018 and 2020, Focus entered into three separate TRAs with Stone Point-affiliated funds and other parties (the “TRA Holders”). The TRAs provide for the payment by Focus to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings in a given year in federal, state, and local income and franchise taxes that the Company realized, or was deemed to realize, with Focus retaining the remaining 15% of the cash savings. In Focus’ 2022 Form 10-K, the Company indicated that it expected future payments to the TRA Holders to be approximately $224.6 million in the aggregate. The TRAs provided, however, that the TRA Holders would be entitled to an “Early Termination Payment” if Focus were sold, calculated by using the present value of future tax savings payable under the TRAs. This present value was calculated by using a discount rate of one-year LIBOR plus 150 basis points (i.e., 1.5%), defined as the “Early Termination Rate” under the TRAs. The application of this lower discount rate to measure the present value of the Company’s future tax savings would result in significant additional payments under the TRAs. Furthermore, in a change of control transaction involving Focus, the Company’s payment obligations under the TRAs would accelerate and become payable in a lump-sum payment due at the time of the Merger. Without a sale, the TRA Holders would need to wait more than fifteen years to receive their full TRA Payments, which would also be subject to potential changes in tax laws, subjecting the TRA Payments to additional uncertainty in the ordinary course. Plaintiffs allege that the TRA Payments that Stone Point, the Special Committee, and the Officer Defendants stood to receive created significant unique incentives for these parties to push for the Merger, regardless of whether it was truly value-maximizing for Focus’ public shareholders. Plaintiffs allege that, from the very beginning, the Board and Goldman Sachs were determined to pursue only private equity buyers and spurned the idea of selling Focus to a strategic buyer. CD&R, a private equity firm that was a longstanding and loyal client of Goldman Sachs, was quickly identified as a viable candidate. This pleased Stone Point and the members of Focus’ executive management team, as a private equity buyer would likely allow them to roll over a portion of their Focus equity into the post-Merger Company. The Board and management negotiated with CD&R for months despite the fact that they were obviously conflicted by their equity rollover aspirations, among other benefits. CD&R was also favored by the Officer Defendants over bidders in the RIA sector because CD&R made it clear that it would retain senior Focus management to run the post-Merger Company. Financial buyers (like CD&R) are much more likely to keep existing management in place than strategic buyers. But strategic buyers (like Mercer) are often willing and able to pay more for a company than financial buyers because: (i) strategic buyers can realize synergistic benefits through economies of scale and the elimination of duplicate functions; and (ii) strategic buyers are generally larger companies with better access to capital, and can offer stock, cash, or a combination of the two in payment of the purchase price. This was exactly the dynamic at play here. When Mercer ultimately made its proposal to acquire Focus, it provided no assurance that it would retain Focus’ current management team. In fact, its January 17, 2023 written proposal to acquire Focus for $51.75 (which it later raised to $55.00) suggested otherwise, touting its view that there existed “an opportunity to consolidate management and operations . . . which could result in meaningful cost savings.” CD&R, by contrast, signaled its intention to maintain Focus’ executive management team early in negotiations. Plaintiffs allege that Focus’ Directors Prematurely Homed in On a Deal With CD&R Without Adequately Considering and Other Potential Buyers. The Board zeroed in on a deal with CD&R without adequately considering, let alone canvassing, an appropriately broad array of potential acquirors. The Board and Special Committee ultimately acquiesced to that deal, even after learning that Mercer conveyed its serious interest in a transaction directly to Focus CEO, Defendant Adolf. This material fact was not disclosed in the Proxy. As early as June 16, 2022, Adolf met with representatives of CD&R as part of the Company’s initial outreach concerning a potential transaction. At the meeting, CD&R’s representatives expressed an interest in potentially acquiring Focus. From that point on, neither the Board nor the Special Committee was interested in canvassing the broader market to find strategic buyers in the RIA sector willing to acquire Focus. The Company’s Board met on June 30, 2022, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss a possible merger transaction and did not discuss even a single potential strategic buyer. Prior to the meeting, Goldman Sachs circulated presentation materials that provided its preliminary analysis of a potential sale process for Focus, including its initial evaluation of CD&R and two other private equity firms, Stone Point and KKR, as potential acquirors. Goldman Sachs’ June 30, 2022 presentation materials did not even identify, let alone analyze, any companies in the wealth management industry as potential strategic acquirors of Focus. Accordingly, the Board did not contact potential strategic acquirors at that time and instead concentrated only on potential financial buyers—buyers like CD&R. Defendants’ failure to consider or engage with strategic acquirors continued throughout the sale process. From July through December 2022, the Board and Special Committee excluded consideration of strategic acquirors as potential merger partners. In many instances, this was because Company management, Goldman Sachs, or Jefferies discouraged consideration of strategic acquirors by the Special Committee and Board. For example, during July and August 2022, Defendant Adolf met exclusively with private equity firms to discuss a potential transaction. In addition to CD&R, Defendant Adolf met with representatives of United States-based private equity firms KKR and Hellman & Friedman as well as the Canadian pension fund Public Sector Pension Investment Board. While each of these funds expressed some interest, they did not concretely engage at the time, primarily because of deal financing issues. KKR, for example, stated it was “[u]ncomfortable putting forth a bid in August due to [the] financing market backdrop,” and wanted to “re-engage when financing markets normalize.” Hellman & Friedman also indicated interest, but informed Adolf it “would like to pursue changes to [the] business model if [Focus is] taken private.” From the perspective of Focus shareholders, these were paths to potentially increasing the sale price of the Company. From the perspective of Defendants, however, they were nonstarters. Defendants did not want to wait and they did not want a deal that would not allow Focus’ executives to continue in their leadership roles. CD&R, by contrast, indicated it would leave the Focus business model and senior management in place after a merger. Public Sector Pension Investment Board was only interested in engaging as a co-investor on any transaction with Focus, and told Adolf it would reach out on a potential Focus transaction after “Labor Day,” but ultimately did not do so. Despite this lack of immediate interest by financial sponsors other than CD&R, Goldman Sachs still discouraged the Board from considering outreach to other companies in the RIA sector as potential strategic acquirors of Focus. Adolf himself avoided meetings with strategic parties, as such buyers would likely jettison Focus’ existing management team. Indeed, Adolf was initially introduced to Mercer on September 20, 2022 to discuss a potential transaction between the companies, but he avoided a follow up meeting for months. While Mercer attempted to schedule a meeting with Defendant Adolf throughout September and October 2022, Adolf did not agree to meet until November 15, 2022. By this time, Defendants had been engaging with CD&R concerning a potential merger for five months—giving CD&R a significant process and informational advantage over Mercer or any other bidders. Indeed, it appears Adolf delayed setting up a meeting with Mercer in order to allow negotiations with CD&R to advance without competition. When Adolf finally met with Mercer, Mercer informed Adolf that it had a concrete interest in engaging in a “transformative transaction” with Focus. Defendants never disclosed executive-level contact with Adolf in September and November 2022. According to the minutes of a Special Committee meeting held December 28, 2022, Jeff Haller of Goldman Sachs revealed at that meeting to Adolf’s fellow directors, for the first time, that “Adolf, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, had previously met with [Mercer] chief executive officer and that [Mercer] had previously expressed an interest in engaging in a transformative transaction.” Slides presented by Goldman Sachs and Jefferies at this meeting further stated under a heading titled “New Strategics (Sponsor-Owned)”: “CEO, [redacted] was recently introduced to Rudy and has been positioning firm for a transformative opportunity.” Negotiations with CD&R were significantly advanced by this point, putting"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Walmart is the largest operator of discount retail stores in the United States. In addition to a diverse assortment of retail offerings, Walmart stores have self-contained pharmacies. Accordingly, shoppers can fill prescriptions at nearly 5,000 Company-owned and operated retail pharmacies in the U.S. Indeed, Walmart operates pharmacies to draw customers into its stores who then buy other non-pharmacy goods. Since 2011, Walmart’s 5,000 pharmacies nationwide, which dispense prescription opioids and other controlled substances, have accounted for more than 10% of Walmart’s domestic net sales. In addition, until 2018, Walmart “self-distributed” controlled substances which serviced Walmart’s own retail pharmacies in the U.S. Because Walmart dispensed and distributed controlled substances, including highly addictive and dangerous Class II opioids, Walmart was subject to the comprehensive but well-established requirements of the CSA and related regulations. The CSA required Walmart to implement reporting mechanisms and controls designed to, inter alia, (i) identify and report to the DEA suspicious orders of controlled substances; (ii) identify and investigate suspicious prescriptions (e.g., large, repeat orders from “pill-mill” doctors) and “refuse to fill” (“RTF”) such orders; (iii) report RTF events to the DEA; (iv) provide internal reporting such that Walmart pharmacists could identify red-flagged prescriptions across its nationwide platform; and (v) prevent theft of controlled substances by Walmart employees. Walmart’s failure to comply with the CSA prompted the DEA to take nationwide action against it in 2009. In November 2009, the DEA issued an Order to Show Cause seeking to revoke the registration of a Walmart in California to dispense controlled substances. To resolve the enforcement proceeding stemming from the 2009 Order to Show Cause (“2009 OTSC”), and “avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation” Walmart and the DEA entered into a nationwide memorandum of agreement in 2011 (“2011 MOA”). The 2011 MOA was for a four-year term, was national in scope, and required Walmart to implement a variety of compliance measures within no later than four years and maintain a robust compliance program to ensure compliance with the CSA. The 2011 MOA essentially put Walmart on probation. Despite this, Walmart egregiously violated the 2011 MOA. As Brad Nelson, a controlled substances compliance director at Walmart wrote in an email to a regional manager less than a month before the MOA’s expiration: “The MOA requires that the reporting of Refusal to fills expires in 30 days. We have not invested a great amount of time and effort in doing analysis on the data since the agreement is virtually over. Driving sales and patient awareness is a far better use of our Market Directors and Market manager’s time.” Indeed, in 2014, Walmart’s corporate compliance department internally acknowledged, in a corporate governance “worksheet,” of which Walmart’s board of directors was informed, that Walmart had “no processes in place” to comply with its legal requirements to have a functioning suspicious order monitoring system pursuant to the 2011 MOA and the CSA. The Company further recognized that because of its CSA violations Walmart was “likely” to experience “severe financial and reputational impact.” Then, in 2015, Walmart internally acknowledged that its suspicious order monitoring system required “immediate and substantial enhancements” to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of non-compliance with [the CSA].” Unsurprisingly, EDTX DOJ began a criminal investigation into Walmart’s dispensing and distribution practices in December 2016. The Criminal Investigation came after the DEA raided one of Walmart’s stores- a rare occurrence for a Fortune 500 company. The Criminal Investigation uncovered Walmart’s systematic CSA violations. Walmart pharmacists from all over the country told the Company that they did not want to fill prescriptions of opioids because they were from doctors running pill mills. Customers in Texas had died after taking suspect prescriptions that Walmart filled. Pharmacists pleaded with Walmart’s corporate office. Walmart refused to take corporate-wide action. Instead, it provided bonuses to pharmacists based on the number of prescriptions filled and pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions as quickly as possible. On March 28, 2018, U.S. attorneys at EDTX DOJ informed Walmart that it was going to indict the Company. In May 2018, EDTX DOJ told Walmart that the indictment was imminent and that the Company should pay $1 billion to settle the civil charges. In the months that followed Walmart’s top lawyers met with EDTX prosecutors. Walmart’s lawyers consulted Defendant McMillon who approved the Company’s presentation to the DOJ wherein it attempted to convince the DOJ not to indict Walmart. Walmart’s top outside counsel at Jones Day highlighted the damage an indictment would cause to Walmart and its shareholders describing the “profound negative impact on the lives and families of the Company’s 1.5 million U.S. employees and its innocent shareholders. The decision to indict Walmart could ultimately result in layoffs. It would also likely mean the loss of billions of dollars in the value of Walmart shares held in retirement saving accounts for millions of Americans and the pension funds of countless nonprofits and public employees.” The U.S. Attorneys working on the Criminal Investigation characterized Walmart’s pleas as no different than that of a criminal defendant who pleads for leniency stating his children will be harmed by his incarceration. They stated that Walmart’s size did not make it above prosecution. According to federal prosecutors working on the case, Walmart exploited its access to high level DOJ officials by lobbying to quash the contemplated criminal indictment. Around the same time, Walmart hired Rachel Brand, A DOJ official in Washington DC- to further influence the DOJ. Shortly thereafter, DOJ leadership instructed the U.S. Attorney for EDTX to drop the criminal indictment. Notwithstanding the declination, of which Walmart was informed on August 31, 2018, the Civil Investigation against the Company continued. According to prosecutors, Walmart did not cooperate with the investigation. For example, Walmart never gave prosecutors a full list of doctors that pharmacists were concerned about; Walmart did not give prosecutors full information on its internal databases to analyze prescribing information and patterns; and most importantly, Walmart refused to produce emails between compliance officials and the Company’s senior management. Defendants concealed from Investors the existence of the Government Investigations, as well as the 2009 OTSC and 2011 MOA. On March 25, 2020 before the market opened, the Pulitzer-prize winning investigative journalism news source ProPublica published a 7,500 word expose disclosing for the first time that the EDTX DOJ had been criminally investigating Walmart for violating the CSA and related laws since 2016. The article revealed that in March 2018 Defendants became aware that EDTX DOJ intended to indict the Company and that even after the DOJ declined to indict the Company it remained the subject of an ongoing DOJ civil investigation. The article also revealed that Walmart entered a secret settlement with the DEA in 2011 in which it agreed to implement measures to comply with the CSA, and that Walmart had received more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA from 2000 to 2018 for its opioid prescribing practices. The article further revealed that Walmart did not comply with the 2011 MOA, prompting the EDTX DOJ to pursue criminal charges against the Company. The article noted that it was “troubling to the federal investigators” that Walmart violated the CSA from 2011 to 2016, despite the fact that “for much of this period, Walmart was operating under a secret settlement…with the DEA” Indeed, “[p]rosecutors believed that Walmart was not fulfilling the terms of its agreement with the DEA.” On this news, shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share from its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020, to its close at $109.40 on March 25, 2020, damaging investors. Then, on December 22, 2020, the DOJ announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Walmart for alleged violations of the CSA. The DOJ’s complaint alleges that from June 26, 2013 onward, Walmart “knowingly filled thousands of controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical purposes or in the usual course of medical practice, and that it filled prescriptions outside the ordinary course of pharmacy practice.” The DOJ complaint also alleged that, “as the operator of its distribution centers, which ceased distributing controlled substances in 2018, Walmart received hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders that it failed to report as required to by the DEA.” The DOJ stated that “these actions helped to fuel the prescription opioid crisis.” The DOJ’s press release stated that it sought civil penalties which “could total in billions” and injunctive relief. On this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%, over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020, damaging investors. Despite Defendants’ awareness of: (1) the 2011 MOA, (2) Walmart’s CSA violations, (3) the EDTX DOJ’s Criminal Investigation and intent to indict the Company, (4) the Civil Investigation and (5) Walmart’s own acknowledgment that it was likely the Company would face severe financial and reputational damage based on its CSA violations and failure to comply with the 2011 MOA, Defendants: 1) Misrepresented that they had disclosed all legal proceedings where a liability is “reasonably possible” and “may be material,” despite having never disclosed the Government Investigations (or the 2011 MOA); 2) violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles governing the disclosure of contingent liabilities by failing to disclose the Government Investigations as a contingent liability in Walmart’s Class Period financial statements despite being aware that it was at least reasonably possible (GAAP’s threshold requiring disclosure) that Walmart would incur a material liability as a result of the Government Investigations; 3) violated Item 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.30 (“Item 103”) which requires disclosure of material legal proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, by failing to disclose the Government Investigations; 4) set forth boilerplate risk disclosures related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired while concealing the Government Investigations; and 5) falsely portrayed Walmart as a “steward” in the opioid crisis with “comprehensive policies and training to help support its pharmacists in filling prescriptions only for legitimate medical reasons” when in truth Walmart’s policies were specifically designed to prevent pharmacists from refusing to fill illegitimate prescriptions. Additionally, Defendants McMillon and Biggs issued false and misleading Sarbanes Oxley certifications attesting to the accuracy of the Company’s financial statements and statements in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports, despite the violations of GAAP and SEC regulations and false statements described above. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the decline in the market value of the Company’s securities following a series of corrective disclosures, Investors and other Class members suffered significant damages. JURISDICTION AND VENUE The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) and 78t(a)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC (17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5).

Named Plaintiff Roseanne Lacy purchased shares of Walmart common stock during the Class Period and was damaged thereby. Defendant Walmart engages in retail and wholesale operations in various formats worldwide. Walmart Stores Inc. changed its name to Walmart Inc. in February 2018. Walmart operates approximately 5,000 pharmacies within its Walmart and Sam’s Club Stores. Walmart’s pharmacy business earned $21.1 billion in prescription drug dispensing revenue in 2019, making it the fifth largest pharmacy chain in the United States by that metric. Walmart is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters at 702 SW 8th Street, Bentonville, AR 72716. Walmart’s securities trade on New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “WMT.” Defendant Douglas C.

The scienter of the Individual Defendants and other employees and agents of the Company is similarly imputed to Walmart under respondeat superior and agency principles. Defendants Walmart and the Individual Defendants are collectively referred to herein as “Defendants.” Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee is responsible for assisting each business segment and functional area of the Company through the oversight of ethics and compliance matters. This oversight includes making recommendations about identification, monitoring, and mitigation of compliance risks. Members of the Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee include Walmart’s CEO and senior executive team as well as the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and other members of management with responsibility for ethics, compliance and risk oversight. The committee meets approximately ten times per year to discuss relevant topics related to ethics, compliance and risk. McMillon and Biggs, as members of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee, had specific insight into and awareness of compliance risks, including the risks related to Walmart’s business dispensing and distributing controlled substances. ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT Introduction As detailed below, prior to and during the Class Period Walmart acted as both a pharmacy that dispensed controlled substances and a distributor of controlled substances to its own Walmart and Sam’s Club branded pharmacies. At all relevant times, Walmart was subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (“Controlled Substances Act” or “CSA”). Prior to and during the Class Period Walmart flagrantly violated the CSA. On December 22, 2020, after conducting a “painstaking” investigation, the United States Department of Justice filed a civil enforcement action against Walmart in this Court. A copy of the complaint in the DOJ Action (“DOJ Complaint”) is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein. The DOJ Complaint alleges that “Walmart chose, for years, to disregard a well-established legal obligation on a systematic basis and a huge scale involving at least hundreds of thousands of orders of controlled substances. In doing so, Walmart substantially benefitted itself while increasing the risk of undetected unlawful conduct and serious widespread harm to Americans in the midst of a nationwide prescription drug abuse epidemic.” Walmart is also the subject of scores of civil lawsuits stemming from its CSA violations, subjecting it to billions of dollars in liability and severe and irreversible reputational damage. Walmart is a defendant in a multidistrict litigation that thousands of states, counties, cities, municipalities, and towns across the United States have brought related to the opioid epidemic. See In re National Prescription Opiate Litig., 17-md-02804 (N.D. Ohio) (“Opioid MDL” or “MDL”). The Opioid MDL has been pending since December 1, 2017. On January 27, 2020 the MDL Court denied Walmart’s motion for summary judgment stating that: “A jury could review the record evidence and find that Pharmacy Defendants [including Walmart] shares a general conspiratorial objective, with themselves and other Defendants, to expand the opioid market using false information and disregarded regulatory obligations in order to achieve that goal; and “[T]he record evidence suggests obvious deficiencies that a layperson could plainly recognize” in Walmart’s compliance program. After the first bellwether trial in the Opioid MDL, which lasted six weeks, on November 23, 2021 a jury found Walmart liable for helping fuel the opioid crisis. On August 17, 2022 the MDL Court issued an Abatement Order and Injunction requiring Walmart to pay a penalty of $216,866,667 and undertake numerous actions to comply with the CSA, including having an independent CSA compliance monitor for a period of 15 years. In connection with the Opioid MDL, the MDL Court permitted plaintiffs to depose Defendant McMillon, finding evidence demonstrating McMillon’s personal knowledge of and involvement in both Walmart’s opioid compliance policies and the Criminal Investigation. Specifically, in October 2016 McMillion bumped into a friend, Jerry Jones, who had lost a son to opioids. McMillion asked Jones what Walmart could do to help his “mission” of combatting the opioid crisis, making clear that he was serious and not asking just to be polite. The Opioid MDL Court found that “there are emails showing suggestions Jones made to McMillon, and McMillon forwarding those ideas to other Walmart executives.” Additionally, the MDL Court found that “plaintiffs also offer evidence and colorable argument that McMillon has personal knowledge about PowerPoint presentations made by Walmart’s counsel to the Department of Justice…and there is evidence that McMillon was consulted during the formulation and approval of Walmart’s response to the DOJ investigation.” Controlled Substances Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Pub. L. No. 91-"

      "summary": "FxWinning is a Hong Kong limited company that operates online trading platforms. CFT, a Delaware limited liability company, purports to offer investors a “High-Frequency Trading System” that “use[s] . . . high-power computers . . . to execute a large number of orders at extremely high speeds, detecting emerging trends in a fraction of a second,” which accordingly allows “traders [to] make profits even with very small price fluctuations.” CFT’s software allegedly conducts trades on the foreign exchange (forex) market. According to CFT, investors gain access to its software only by opening an account with FxWinning. CFT and FxWinning held several joint marketing events such as a CFT “Masterminds” event in Miami and a yacht party with multiple Plaintiffs. In addition, de Rocha, the CEO of CFT, hosted monthly Zoom sessions exclaiming the benefits to investing with CFT and FxWinning, stating (through his translator Renaud Adorno) that de Rocha had “zero” issues with FxWinning and trusted it over any other potential broker. De Rocha also hosted Plaintiffs on a yacht and in the Bahamas at which he pushed Plaintiffs to increase their investments. In December 2022, Defendants held a “summit” in the Bahamas during which CFT and FxWinning (through their executives, including but not limited to de Rocha) celebrated the high returns that Plaintiffs were purportedly earning and pushed Plaintiffs to increase their investments. Plaintiffs viewed de Rocha’s Zoom sessions both before and after investing with CFT and FxWinning. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of Defendants’ representations, which were made in person by the Companies’ executives, and includes the representations on their websites, on CFT’s Telegram channel, and via de Rocha’s Zoom sessions, each of the Plaintiffs opened accounts with the Companies and began depositing funds into their trading accounts. Each of the Plaintiffs also signed limited power-of-attorney agreements with CFT for CFT to effectuate trading on the FxWinning accounts. In exchange for its services, CFT charged Plaintiffs either a 40% or 50% account management fee. Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs’ funds were pooled together to effectuate CFT’s and FxWinning’s operation of its software. CFT maintained complete control over its software and the alleged trading it and FxWinning conducted using its and FxWinning’s software. Plaintiffs did not possess any control over any alleged trades on the Companies’ platform and instead were only able to see their purported account balances. Plaintiffs were not permitted to create an account and “start trading” until they certified that they agreed to FxWinning’s terms and conditions, available on both the fxwinning.net and fxwinning.pro websites. Section 3.4 of the terms and conditions provides that at “all times” Plaintiffs “have the right to withdraw [the amount owed as the balance of the account].” The terms and conditions provided no restrictions on Plaintiffs’ ability to withdraw their funds. Even after Plaintiffs opened their accounts, Defendants pushed Plaintiffs to continuously deposit more and more money into their accounts—all of which greatly benefited CFT as it earned a 40% or 50% fee based on a percentage of the funds in the accounts. Percy benefited through Plaintiffs’ investments and received at least $141,625.48 in commissions. Defendants also held conferences and invited Plaintiffs (among other potential investors) as their guests to a “summit” in the Bahamas in December 2022 during which CFT and FxWinning (through their executives, including but not limited to de Rocha) celebrated the high returns that Plaintiffs were purportedly earning and pushed Plaintiffs to increase their investments. Plaintiff Campbell personally attended the Bahamas summit and heard and relied on Defendants’ representations, including those by de Rocha. To promote the platform and services during the summit to, among others, U.S. investors, Defendants introduced attorneys general Matthew Whitaker (former acting United States Attorney General) and Todd Rokita (Indiana Attorney General) as CFT’s latest board members and paid them to speak regarding Defendants’ (particularly de Rocha’s) professionalism and business judgment. To further convince investors of the security of its and FxWinning’s software, CFT presented a purported KPMG audit report stating that all trades had been reviewed. Defendants also provided Plaintiffs what was purported to be the CFT dashboard showing the success of the Companies’ forex trading. CFT stated that the Companies’ trading was 71% successful and “one of the best software in the world.” Around the same time as the Summit, CFT posted on its Telegram channel on December 16, 2022, that the Companies would soon stop accepting new clients and thus promote a limited supply, to increase demand on the accounts. CFT stated there were only “2,000 vacancies left.” Following the December Bahamas summit, however, and beginning in or around January 2023, Defendants began informing Plaintiffs that their withdrawals would be delayed. Whereas withdrawals initially took 24-48 hours, Defendants represented that due to the holidays and for other reasons, withdrawals would take several days to process. By the middle of January, Defendants informed Plaintiffs that any requested withdrawals would take up to two weeks. Defendants continued to nevertheless request that Plaintiffs deposit additional funds – despite disallowing any withdrawals. For example, de Rocha stated on CFT’s telegram channel on February 3, 2023, that the Companies would soon close out new investments and that “if interested, get in now.” CFT represented that “nobody new will be able to use the software, only if one of you wants to give your software license to someone else.” CFT accordingly represented that its “software license”—which CFT claimed entitled the individual to its high returns—was transferrable. By the end of February 2023, Defendants told Plaintiffs that no withdrawals would be made. Defendants blamed the inability to process any withdrawals on new KYC/AML requirements that FxWinning’s liquidity provider had purportedly instituted. Defendants did not provide a timeline when the KYC/AML process would be complete. CFT sold the KYC process as a positive and represented an increase in regulatory oversight and would also increase profits. By or around late March and early April 2023, Plaintiffs had submitted all requested information to comply with Defendants’ purported updated KYC/AML procedures. The information that Plaintiffs submitted to CFT and FxWinning included documentation further showing the Plaintiffs’ U.S. residencies. In April 2023, FxWinning advised Plaintiffs that the time to process withdrawals would depend on the KYC/AML process. On April 16, 2023, FxWinning posted the following on its website: The KYC process continues to evolve, and many clients have already been approved through emails. For those who were approved and had pending withdrawals, we are happy to inform you that the withdrawals have been processed and your accounts are properly normalized…. Our goal is to normalize all withdrawals as soon as possible, ensuring security and compliance with applicable regulations. We value your trust in our platform and strive to offer the highest level of service and professionalism. By or around late May and early June 2023, FxWinning informed Plaintiffs by email that their applications/updated information were “successfully completed” and that FxWinning would process Plaintiffs’ withdrawals within “15 working days.” Despite representing by June 2023 that Plaintiffs’ withdrawals would be processed within fifteen days, Defendants have yet to release any of Plaintiffs’ funds. On June 12, 2023, FxWinning posted to its website that “We expect withdrawal payments to become effective immediately, having received the green light to start this process.” On June 17, 2023, Plaintiff Campbell messaged Brito Cutie stating that he had “put in a withdrawal request on Monday and haven’t gotten the confirmation email. No response from support either.” Brito Cutie informed Campbell on June 20, 2023, that FxWinning would have to close the company, but nevertheless reassured Campbell that the “client portal will remain, so everyone can see all,” withdrawals would happen soon, and “Nothing [is] lost as people believe.” Despite FxWinning’s and Brito Cutie’s representations that the withdrawals would be forthcoming, FxWinning posted the following on its website on June 20, 2023: Important Notice: FxWinning Limited regrets to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances, our services will cease on Thursday, 22.06.2023. Please close all open trades before Wednesday 21.06.2023 13:00 GMT+3 to avoid possible problems. Kindly withdraw your remaining funds promptly, and our team will assist you in the process. Withdrawals will be available until Friday 30.06.2023. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding during this challenging time. FxWinning has, to date, failed to release any of Plaintiffs’ funds or process their withdrawals, despite numerous requests to do so, and any “normalizing” or “approval” that FxWinning and Brito Cutie stated would occur did not result in any withdrawals being processed. Plaintiffs allege that, whereas Defendants prevented any withdrawals by Plaintiffs, Defendants (including de Rocha, Percy, Cardenas, Merino, and Brito Cutie) withdrew millions of dollars for their own personal benefit. The total value of Plaintiffs’ accounts is approximately $27,311,827.00. Plaintiffs bring the following claims against Defendants: violation of the Securities Act of 1933 (Count I); violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Count II); violation of the Commodities Exchange Act (Count III); violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act (Count IV); breach of contract (Count V); breach of fiduciary duty (Count VI); fraud in the inducement (Count VII); negligent misrepresentation (Count VIII); conversion (Count IX); unjust enrichment (Count X); and civil conspiracy (Count XI).",

      "summary": "Defendant ATI Physical Therapy, Inc. (“ATI”) is an Illinois-based provider of outpatient rehabilitation services. Defendant Labeed Diab (“Diab”) served as the company’s CEO from February 2019 until August 2021, when ATI terminated him as CEO and as a member of its board of directors. Defendant Joseph Jordan (“Jordan”) was the company’s CFO from 2019 through at least the end of the Class Period. Defendant Andrew A. McKnight (“McKnight”) was the CEO of FVAC before it merged with ATI, and has served as a director of ATI since the merger. The FVAC Defendants—Joshua A. Pack, Marc Furstein, Leslee Cowen, Aaron F. Hood, Carmen A. Policy, Rakefet Russak-Aminoach, and Sunil Gulati—were directors of FVAC at all relevant times. ATI was initially founded as Assessment Technologies, Inc. in Willowbrook, Illinois, and has been providing physical therapy services since 1996. FVAC, meanwhile, was incorporated in Delaware in June 2020 as a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar merger with one or more businesses. FVAC completed its initial public offering on August 14, 2020. Plaintiffs allege that, even before FVAC completed its IPO, FVAC had targeted ATI for acquisition. Plaintiffs allege that in or around February 2019, as part of the planned merger, Diab entered into an employment agreement with ATI and became the company’s CEO, replacing McKnight, the company’s former CEO. Jordan was named CFO in 2019, replacing the company’s former CFO. On February 22, 2021, ATI and FVAC announced a proposed merger that would take ATI public. According to multiple former ATI employees, ATI rushed to go public through the merger. On May 14, 2021, FVAC filed its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, soliciting votes in favor of the merger. Beneficial owners and/or holders of record of FVAC common stock at the close of business on May 24, 2021 (the “Record Date”) were entitled to vote on the merger at the FVAC special meeting of stockholders on June 15, 2021. In connection with the merger, FVAC shareholders had the option either to retain their shares, which would be converted to shares of ATI Class A common stock upon completion of the merger, or to redeem their shares for $10.00 per share in cash, whether they voted for or against the merger or abstained from voting. Also on May 14, 2021, FVAC disclosed that on February 21, 2021, in contemplation of the merger, Diab and Jordan entered into new employment agreements with ATI, and that on May 14, 2021, Coco entered into a new employment agreement with ATI. On June 17, 2021, ATI completed the merger with FVAC, and shares of the combined company’s common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ATIP.” Plaintiffs allege that, as a provider of rehabilitation services, ATI’s recruitment and retention of enough physical therapists to meet patient demand is vital to the success and growth of its business. Prior to late 2020, the company’s physical therapist attrition rate hovered at or around 20%, and the average attrition rate for clinical staff and physical therapists in ATI’s industry is around 20%. Plaintiffs allege that the company furloughed most of its physical therapists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Additionally, in 2020, the company faced significantly increased hurdles in acquiring and retaining talent. Plaintiffs allege that, beginning in 2020, the company began to “retitle” the physical therapist positions and to lower physical therapists’ compensation. Plaintiffs allege that, beginning in or around November 2020 and into early 2021, the company’s attrition rate among physical therapists roughly doubled to 41%. Plaintiffs allege that multiple former ATI employees have confirmed that the company was suffering from severe attrition among the ranks of its physical therapists during the Class Period. Plaintiffs allege that, despite having severe attrition rates, defendants repeatedly represented to investors that its staff retention was one of its competitive strengths. Plaintiffs allege that, beginning on February 22, 2021, the start of the Class Period, ATI’s then-CEO, Diab, stated the company had “very high retention” and “low turnover” of its physical therapists. On April 1, 2021, defendants filed an “Analyst Day Presentation” on an SEC Schedule 14A proxy statement. In this document, the company again represented that it had “high retention” and “strong retention” of employees. On May 14, 2021, in the company’s “Definitive Proxy Statement” on SEC Schedule 14A, the company misrepresented that it had a “competitive compensation model” and stated that ATI had “historically been able to realize high retention rates across [its] organization.” On May 20, 2021, the defendants filed “Definitive Additional Materials” in support of the company’s definitive proxy statement, in which they stated, among other things, that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, visit volumes increased, and that “the company continues to match its clinical staffing levels accordingly.” Plaintiffs allege that, in addition to misrepresenting its attrition rates, the company misrepresented the financial impact of these attrition rates on its finances. Plaintiffs allege that, beginning in February 2021 and continuing through July 2021, the company projected the revenues of $731 million for 2021 and Adjusted EBITDA of $119 million for 2021. Plaintiffs allege that the company knew that, due to the massive increase in the attrition rate of its clinical staff by early 2021, the company would be unable to meet its projections and would have to revise them downward in the near future. Plaintiffs allege that the company also overvalued its goodwill by over $433 million during the Class Period, even well after the company had information that its goodwill was seriously impaired due to attrition. Plaintiffs allege that former employees have confirmed that the ATI and FVAC Individual Defendants had access to and/or direct knowledge of the company’s severe attrition rates. Plaintiffs allege that, according to FE-1, the company’s officers and directors, including the ATI and FVAC Individual Defendants, had access to and/or received an internally distributed weekly report that detailed, among other things, the attrition rate among physical therapists. Plaintiffs allege that, at quarterly meetings, the ATI Individual Defendants and the FVAC Defendants addressed the sky-high attrition rate among clinicians. Plaintiffs allege that defendants also tracked attrition and data on potential new-hire candidates in a centralized applicant tracking database. Plaintiffs allege that FE-4 likewise has confirmed that the ATI Individual Defendants had access to the company’s attrition rates. Plaintiffs allege that the monthly slide decks that FE-4 prepared for executive leadership, including Diab and Jordan, featured a “Monthly Scorecard” with a chart including a trend line that detailed the attrition rates among physical therapists. In its statements to investors, the company stated that it expected to open over ninety new clinics in 2021. Plaintiffs allege that, in fact, the company lacked the clinical staff even to support the clinics it had already opened. Plaintiffs allege that, as of April and May 2021, the company lacked the staff to open “90+ clinics” in 2021. Less than two months after becoming a public company, on July 26, 2021, ATI reported its financial results for second quarter of 2021—the same quarter in which the merger was completed. Among other things, ATI revealed that “the acceleration of attrition among [its] therapists in the second quarter and continuing into the third quarter, combined with the intensifying competition for clinicians in the labor market, prevented us from being able to meet the demand we have and increased our labor costs.” As a result, ATI significantly reduced its full-year 2021 revenue guidance from $731 million to a range of $640 million to $670 million, and its adjusted EBITDA guidance from $119 million to a range of $60 million to $70 million. Further, ATI lowered its estimate for new clinic openings in 2021, from 90 clinics to between 55 and 65 clinics, which was also driven by the severe attrition of the company’s physical therapists. In addition, ATI disclosed that the revision to its 2021 earnings guidance constituted an interim triggering event that required further analysis regarding potential impairment to its goodwill and trade name intangible assets, and that ATI would perform interim impairment testing during the third quarter of 2021, the results of which could lead to a material impairment charge for the company. In the same SEC filing, the company announced that Coco, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, “resigned from the company” effective July 23, 2021. As a result of the company’s disclosures on July 26, 2021, the price of ATI stock declined 43.41%, from $8.34 per share to $4.72 per share, on unusually heavy trading volume. The next day, on July 27, 2021, the price of ATI’s share price declined by 19.07%, and closed at $3.82 per share. Over these two trading days, the company’s share price fell by a staggering 62.48%, or $4.52 per share. On August 9, 2021, defendants announced that Diab had been terminated as CEO and as a member of the board of directors. Within days of Diab’s termination, on August 16, 2021, ATI announced that the earnings forecast revision on July 16, 2021 had triggered the need to analyze potential impairment to ATI’s goodwill, trade name indefinite-lived tangible asset. After analysis, the company determined that, “during the period ended June 30, 2021,” it had to recognize (1) a “$33.7 million non-cash impairment charge” because “fair value of [ATI’s] trade name indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value”; and (2) a “$433.2 million non-cash impairment charge” because the “fair value of [ATI’s] single reporting unit was below its carrying value.” Both impairment charges impacted ATI’s goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge line item in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Then, on October 19, 2021, after the close of trading, the company announced “selected preliminary third quarter 2021 results” in which it revised its 2021 earnings guidance. The press release was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and signed by Jordan on behalf of the company. In the press release, the company stated that management had “implemented targeted measures that reduced clinical staff attrition and improved clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) growth during the last two months of the third quarter of 2021.” The company stated that it “made progress towards restoring FTEs with ATI hiring roughly 2 clinicians for every 1 departure in August and September 2021 compared to our second quarter 2021 ratio of approximately 1-to-1.” Additionally, the company stated that “visit volume softened resulting in 20,674 average visits per day during the third quarter of 2021 compared to 21,569 during the second quarter of 2021, or approximately 1 less Visit per Day per Clinic.” The company stated that “[p]revious guidance anticipated continued visit volume growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2021 compared to the second quarter.” The company stated that it “continues to focus on the labor market dynamics, we are also working to improve visit volume growth by enhancing filed relationships and referral networks to strategically position ATI to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.” The company stated that, “[f]or full year 2021,” it was “now projecting revenue to be in a range of $620 million to $630 million from the prior range of $640 million to $670 million and Adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $40 million to $44 million from $60 million to $70 million.” The company stated that “[t]he further reduced guidance is due to lower than expected patient volume.” As a result of the company’s disclosures on October 19, 2021, the price of ATI stock declined by 21.64% on the next trading day, October 20, 2021, from $3.65 per share to $2.86 per share. Then, after the Class Period, on November 16, 2021, ATI disclosed that the company had received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 2021 a request for “the production of documents relating to the earnings forecast and financial information referenced in the company’s July 26, 2021 Form 8-K and related matters.” ATI also disclosed that it was “cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.”",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Founded in 2014, Frequency went public in October 2019. The Company has never earned a profit in any fiscal year and is heavily dependent on the success of FX-322, which is the product the Company was founded to develop. Frequency is also developing a possible treatment for multiple sclerosis, but this product is still in the preclinical stages of development. FX-322 is a treatment Frequency is developing for patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss — or SNHL — which is believed to be caused in part by the depletion of hair cells inside the ear. FX-322 is a proprietary, small molecule drug that is intended to activate progenitor cells within the body. Progenitor cells are descendants of stem cells that then further differentiate to create special types of cells. In simple terms, the Company claims that an intratympanic injection of FX-322 directly into the ear can deliver FX-322 to the cochlea. Once in the cochlea, FX-322 purportedly activates progenitor cells within the body and triggers the regrowth of hairs in the ear. A successful treatment for SNHL would be extremely lucrative. In its IPO offering documents, Frequency explained that it was motivated to develop FX-322 because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had and has yet to approve any drug therapies for the treatment of SNHL. Frequency performed several clinical trials of FX-322. The first trial was solely exploratory and tested whether FX-322 was therapeutically possible. The following “Phase 1” and “Phase 1/2” studies tested the safety of FX-322. Phase 2a was designed to test whether FX-322 was effective as an actual treatment for SNHL. The Phase 1/2 trial of FX-322, which was completed before Phase 2a started, enrolled only 23 patients with mild to moderately severe hearing loss to test solely the safety of FX-322. According to the Company’ October 2020 investor presentation, the results from the Phase 1/2 trial also showed that four of the six enrolled patients with moderate to moderately severe hearing loss had a “statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement” in their hearing. The Company represented that this improvement in hearing was based upon measuring patients’ results on two tests: word recognition and words-in-noise. In a word recognition test, a predetermined list of between 25 and 50 words is read out loud to the patient at a constant volume and the patient is asked to repeat the word he or she has just heard. A patient’s word recognition score is calculated by dividing the number of correctly repeated words by the total number of words on the list. For example, in a word recognition test with 25 words, a patient that correctly identifies 20 of the words will receive a word recognition score of 80%. As word recognition test and a resulting word-recognition score rely heavily on the patient accurately and truthfully reporting what he or she hears to the test’s administrator. Similarly, a words-in-noise, or WIN, test consists of the administration of 70 monosyllabic words divided into two 35 word lists that are pre-recorded with a noisy background. A words-in-noise test is adaptive in that the loudness of the speech fluctuates during the test but the background noise remains constant. A words-in-noise score is calculated based upon how many monosyllabic words can be correctly identified by the patient. As with the word recognition test, the words-in-noise test and resulting words-in-noise score rely heavily on the patient accurately and truthfully reporting what she or he hears to the test’s administrator. In light of the outcome of the Phase 1/2 study, in October 2019, the Company launched Phase 2a. As described in an October 2020 corporate slide deck, the “objectives” of Phase 2a were to: (i) “further establish hearing signal” (i.e., determine the effects of FX-322 as a treatment for SNHL); (ii) “evaluate repeat dosing” to, among other things, determine how much FX-322 was needed to treat SNHL; and (iii) “clarify endpoints and patient population for registration” (i.e., determine the types of patients that would benefit from treatment with FX-322). Phase 2a also had several “exploratory endpoints” to test the effect of treatment with FX-322 on: (i) “word recognition”; (ii) “words-in-noise”; (iii) pure ton audiometry; (iv) quality of life; and (v) “tinnitus.” Phase 2a was supposed to be a “double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center” study of “adults ages 18-65” all of whom “have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Phase 2a had a number of enrollment criteria that potential patients needed to meet in order to become part of the study, as well as certain exclusion criteria that would make a patient ineligible to participate in Phase 2a. Some of those criteria were published by the company, including on the FDA website. According to the FDA, those publicly-available criteria were as follows: Inclusion Criteria: 1. Adults aged 18-65 years inclusive. 2. Established diagnosis of stable sensorineural hearing loss by standard audiometric measures for ≥ 6 months prior to the Screening visit (no changes in air conduction greater than 10 dB at a single frequency or greater than 5 dB at two contiguous frequencies from the prior audiogram to the Screening audiogram in the study ear). 3. Documented medical history consistent with hearing loss being caused by noise exposure or sudden sensorineural hearing loss. 4. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) within 26-70 dB in the ear to be injected. 5. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential or will need to utilize two methods of highly effective contraception during the study participation (e.g. hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device and condoms) or remain abstinent. Male subjects should use condoms with spermicide during the course of the study or remain abstinent. Subjects should not donate sperm or ova during the study period. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Previous participation in FX-322 clinical trial. 2. Currently on any medication consisting of valproic acid, valproate sodium, or divalproex sodium. 3. Perforation of tympanic membrane or other tympanic membrane disorders that would interfere with the delivery and safety assessment of an intratympanic medication or reasonably be suspected to affect tympanic membrane healing after injection in study ear. This includes a current tympanostomy tube. 4. Any conductive hearing loss of greater than 15 dB at a single frequency or greater than 10 dB at two or more contiguous octave frequencies in the study ear at the Screening visit or on the prior audiogram (if the Investigator feels there is not a true conductive hearing loss, the Medical Monitor should be consulted). 5. Active chronic middle ear disease or a history of major middle ear surgery, as an adult, in the ear to be injected. 6. Subject has had an intratympanic injection in either ear within 6 months of the screening visit. 7. History of clinically significant vestibular symptoms at the discretion of the investigator. 8. History of clinically significant systemic autoimmune disease. 9. History of head or neck radiation treatment or exposure. 10. History of platinum-based chemotherapy treatment. 11. Exposure to another investigational drug within 28 days prior to injection of study drug. 12. Evidence of any active or chronic disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator following a detailed medical history, physical examination, and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature). 13. History of substance abuse within 2 years of the Screening Visit. 14. Positive test for drugs of abuse at screening. 15. Positive urine pregnancy test or breast-feeding. 16. Any known factor, condition or disease that, in the view of the Investigator, might interfere with treatment compliance, study conduct or interpretation of the results (e.g. previous high-dose aminoglycoside treatment). In addition to the publicly disclosed inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above, Phase 2a also had “secret,” purportedly undisclosed word-score inclusion criteria. Specifically, all patients needed to score below a certain threshold on a word recognition test. The threshold was established by Frequency as a part of the study design and allegedly to be withheld from the public so as not to bias the entire study. Enrollment in Phase 2a was completed in September 2020. To enroll in Phase 2a, patients had to provide copies of their medical records and, specifically, audiograms, which are graphs plotting the results of a pure-tone hearing test showing how loud sounds need to be at different frequencies to be heard by the patient. All potential enrollees also had screening interviews during which they were asked a series of questions about their hearing loss and medical symptoms by a Phase 2a investigator. Importantly, patients also had to undergo a word recognition test as part of the in-person screening process (and possibly other tests as well). Each patient in Phase 2a was then randomized into one of four treatment cohorts: (i) 24 patients received one dose of FX-322; (ii) 24 patients received two doses; (iii) 24 patients received four doses; and (iv) 24 received a four-dose placebo. Each patient received a weekly injection into one ear containing either FX-322 or placebo and were then tracked weekly for 210 days after the first injection. Frequency first assessed the Phase 2a’s results 90 days after completion of the regimen and again in the months after. Concurrently with the start of the Phase 2a study, in its 3Q 2019 Form 10-Q issued on November 18, 2019, Frequency announced that it would release the results obtained from the study “in the second half of 2020.” The Company pushed back the deadline to release the results to the spring of 2021, blaming the delay on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in its FY 2019 Form 10-K filed on March 26, 2020. At a basic level, bias in the context of a clinical trial refers to any systematic error in a study that encourages one outcome over others. Bias leads to a distortion of the true effects of the drug being studied and will likely result in a study that fails to show any statistically significant or otherwise meaningful results. There are many different biases in clinical trials. For example, “selection bias” is consciously or unconsciously assigning patients with same traits to the same treatment group (e.g., selecting all the men in the study to receive the treatment and all women to receive the placebo). Similarly, “detection bias” occurs when study results are recorded, consciously or unconsciously, in a way that favors the desired outcome of the study. Bias can be the death knell for a clinical trial of a new drug because it undermines the validity of the study’s results. It becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether any effects of the treatment are actually caused by the drug or, instead, if those effects are just the result of bias. Moreover, certain biases are also likely to lead to anomalous and unrepresentative results, which is what happened here. Given how severely biases can undermine an entire clinical trial, there are well-established ways to design a study to mitigate biases. For example, selection bias can be controlled by randomizing who receives the treatment and who receives the placebo, while detection bias can be controlled by “blinding” the investigator as to whether a patient has received the drug or the placebo. This action concerns a systematic error in Phase 2a’s caused by “self selection bias” or “volunteer bias”: Patients were able to intentionally enroll in the study notwithstanding the fact that they did not meet all of Phase 2a’s inclusion criteria. Clinical trials are intended to test drugs on a pre-specified group of patients that is representative of the entire population that has the condition that the drug is intended to treat (in this case, SNHL). Self-selection bias occurs when individuals with certain characteristics intentionally and disproportionately select themselves into a study. As a result of this bias, the pre-specified group of patients in the study ends up not being representative of the entire population. Consequently, the results of a clinical trial infected by self-selection bias cannot be generalized to the larger population and are much more likely to fail to show any meaningful or statistically significant effects. As detailed herein, Defendants knew (or recklessly disregarded) that patients in Phase 2a intentionally misidentified (or failed to identify) words spoken to them as part of a word recognition test, which caused those patients to have artificially low word-recognition scores and thus become eligible for Phase 2a. By self-selecting into Phase 2a in this way, these patients ultimately tainted the study’s results by creating a sample that had better hearing than the overall population with SNHL. The evidence Plaintiff has uncovered so far suggests that at least some patients suffering from tinnitus faked their word recognition tests when they were screened for Phase 2a to obtain early treatment with FX-322. The way to obtain such early access was by participating in a study. Tinnitus commonly presents as a ringing in one or both ears, but it can also sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. Tinnitus is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying issue with the auditory system, which can be caused by different health conditions, such as noise-induced hearing loss, ear and sinus infections, brain tumors, and thyroid abnormalities, among other things. There is currently no FDA-approved cure for tinnitus. In severe cases, tinnitus can cause people to have difficulty concentrating and sleeping, and it can interfere with a person’s daily life and has even been linked to suicide. As a result, individuals with severe tinnitus are notoriously desperate for a cure. The belief that FX-322 could possibly be a cure for tinnitus originated with patients that took part in the Phase 1 trials for FX-322 and anecdotally reported an improvement in their tinnitus after being treated with the drug. Those anecdotes were at least partially confirmed by LeBel. In July 2020, LeBel was interviewed on a podcast called “Tinnitus Talk” (which is related to the online tinnitus support group detailed below, see ¶¶51-57). Lebel was asked if there were “any anecdotes or patient testimonials that kind of corroborate” that FX-322 “might have a profound effect on tinnitus.” He responded: “[W]e don’t have data. Certainly there is anecdotal reports as patients have come back and visited with ENTs when they have had conversations with them about how they are doing. Some of them have offered that they have had improvements in tinnitus, there’s nothing that we can quantitate there. Again, it adds to the excitement of the opportunity” of FX-322. The fact that one of Phase 2a’s exploratory end points was to test the impact of FX-322 on tinnitus was also frequently cited on tinnitus message boards as evidence that FX-322 could potentially treat tinnitus. Plaintiff has identified numerous online message boards discussing FX-322 as a potential treatment for tinnitus. For example, the Tinnitus Talk forum, which is an online support group for sufferers of tinnitus, has an entire message board related to FX-322, including Phase 2a (and the Company’s prior clinical trials). According to one of the website’s founders, as of July 2020, the FX-322 thread on the Tinnitus Talk forum had around 9,000 posts and nearly a million views. Currently, that thread is nearly 650 pages long, with much of the discussion — hundreds, if not thousands of posts — related to Phase 2a. Whether and how to enroll in Phase 2a was a frequent topic of discussion on the Tinnitus Talk forum with many individuals motivated by a desire to gain early access to FX-322 and a potential cure for their tinnitus. As one forum member put it in a post from December 2019: I can tell you that if I could get my hands on FX-322 I’d get shot into my ear today. I have no material concerns that it would harm me given where it is in the approval process. People are literally killing themselves over tinnitus – the risks are worth the potential reward. Similarly, a different forum member remarked in October 2019, “If you really want this [(i.e., FX-322)], participate in a trial.” Several individuals on the Tinnitus Talk forum reported that they had tried to enroll in Phase 2a and had been rejected. The reasons for those rejections were likewise a heavily discussed topic, which often focused around Phase 2a’s enrollment inclusion and exclusion criteria. The publicly available inclusion and exclusion criteria were often quoted and discussed at length of the forum. For example, in a post from November 2019, one forum member said “here is the exclusion criteria” and then listed the 16 publicly available study criteria as they appeared on the FDA’s website. Forum members also compared hearing test results to determine if they were eligible to enroll in Phase 2a. For example, in November 2019 one forum member asked another forum member, “Can you share your audiogram with me if you don’t mind? I still need to get an updated one because mine’s like a year old but I feel like my hearing is not bad enough for me to qualify” for Phase 2a. Most importantly, Phase 2a’ purportedly undisclosed word recognition inclusion criteria were openly discussed on the Tinnitus Talk forum. On February 13, 2020 — while Phase 2a was still actively enrolling patients and a full seven months before enrollment ended — Form Member A made the following post on the FX-322 forum: So quick update everyone: Unfortunately[,] I was officially rejected. The reason they gave is that they need at least 85% or less word score recognition and mine is 100% (which is slightly odd because I did say several times I couldn’t understand the words but shrug). I know a lot of people asked for the reason they were rejected and weren’t give one but the Torrance location seems to be extremely forthcoming with information, and didn’t hesitate to tell me at all. Not sure why. But ultimately it looks like they are looking for a combination of audiogram loss and depleted word scores. Best of luck to anyone still trying to get in. In fact, on March 23, 2021 — the very day the Company revealed the bias in Phase 2a — that same Forum Member A posted the following on the FX-322 forum: I actually fear I might have been unknowingly complicit in the whole fraud thing, if that turns out to be truly legitimate. Most people were not given the reason for their rejection from the Phase 2a trial, but I was. They point blank told me that although my audiogram qualified me, my WR scores did not, and I shared that here on the forums… my intention was to save people the hassle, money, and mental stamina of getting a HF audiogram if they (like me) had no WR issues. Because it ultimately wouldn’t matter even if you had measurable notches. But now I see why most testing sites would not disclose the reason why people were rejected . . . because if you knew that the WR scores were the lynch pin you could more easily lie your way into the trial. God I feel like I really fucked up. In response to Forum Member A’s March 23"

      "summary": "GM and Cruise are companies that develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. GM acquired a majority stake in Cruise in 2016, and by the beginning of the class period, GM had an 80% stake in Cruise. Plaintiffs allege that GM and Cruise, along with their respective officers, made materially false and misleading statements about the capabilities and safety of Cruise’s autonomous vehicles throughout the class period. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants repeatedly touted Cruise’s AV technology as “fully driverless,” “fully autonomous,” and “Level 4,” which investors understood to mean that Cruise’s AVs could drive safely, reliably, and legally without human input, and that the technology was mature enough for Cruise to operate a revenue-generating robotaxi business. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants also repeatedly told investors that Cruise’s AV technology was safer than a human driver. Plaintiffs allege that in reality, Cruise’s AV technology was highly dependent on remote operators who intervened every 2.5 to 5 miles, faced an enormous number of safety issues, struggled with basic requirements of safe driving, and routinely stopped in traffic or became dangerously stranded. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants also made omissions and deceitful conduct in relation to a crash that occurred on October 2, 2023. On that date, a Cruise AV struck a pedestrian, pinned the pedestrian underneath the vehicle, and then dragged the pedestrian approximately 20 feet before coming to a stop. Plaintiffs allege that in the period after the crash, Defendants made misrepresentations to and through the media concerning the crash by releasing a misleading version of the video of the crash, which cut out before the pullover maneuver, and representing to media outlets that the AV came to a complete stop without any reference to the pullover maneuver and pedestrian dragging. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ misleading conduct was intended to and did create a false public perception of Cruise’s role in the crash, and that the conduct also had the effect of hiding from the public that Cruise would face, or was at risk of facing, serious repercussions from regulators. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ fraud began to be revealed on October 24, 2023, when the DMV suspended Cruise’s permits to deploy and test its AVs without a human safety driver. On that same day, Cruise published a blog post acknowledging for the first time that the Cruise AV involved in the October 2, 2023 crash collided with the pedestrian and then attempted to pull over, pulling the individual forward approximately 20 feet. Plaintiffs allege that the fraud was partially revealed again on October 26, 2023, when the NHTSA released a letter it had sent to Cruise six days earlier indicating that the NHTSA was investigating five reports of Cruise vehicles engaging in inappropriately hard braking that resulted in collisions. Plaintiffs allege that the fraud was partially revealed again on November 8, 2023, when Cruise announced and the media reported that Cruise issued a recall impacting its entire fleet of 950 driverless cars across the US. Plaintiffs allege that the recall notice described that the Collision Detection Subsystem, which is responsible for detecting a collision and electing a post-collision response, may, after a collision, cause the Cruise AV to attempt to pull over out of traffic instead of remaining stationary when a pullover is not the desired post-collision response. Plaintiffs allege that on these three revelations, GM’s stock price declined by almost 2.3%, almost 4.8%, and over 3%, respectively, losing billions in market capitalization. Plaintiffs bring four counts under the Exchange Act, on behalf of themselves and a class consisting of all persons who purchased GM securities between February 24, 2021 and November 8, 2023. Count I is brought under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) against all Defendants. Count II is brought under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) against all Defendants. Count III is brought under Section 20(a) against Defendants Barra, Jacobson, and Parks as control persons of GM. Count IV is brought under Section 20(a) against the Individual Defendants as control persons of Cruise. Defendants move to dismiss all counts. The Court grants the motion to dismiss in part and denies it in part.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Lead Plaintiffs bring this putative class action against Wells Fargo and four of its former executives (collectively, Defendants) for alleged violations of federal securities laws. The purported class consists of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities issued by Wells Fargo between February 2, 2018 and March 12, 2020 (the Class Period). The following facts are taken from the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (CAC), documents incorporated therein by reference, and judicially noticeable documents. Wells Fargo is a nationally chartered bank subject to the oversight of three national regulators: (i) the Federal Reserve, (ii) the OCC, and (iii) the CFPB (collectively, the Regulators). The Regulators have broad supervisory and enforcement powers, including the authority to monitor and enforce corrective action to ensure banking institutions do not violate the law. The Regulators may employ an escalating set of corrective actions to deter and punish unsafe and illegal lending and banking practices, including imposing civil monetary penalties and formal, public enforcement actions, such as a consent order. When these remedies fail, the Regulators may impose restrictions on the activities and functions a bank can undertake, restrict its growth (e.g., capping the bank’s assets), or direct the bank to remove particular officers or directors. The Regulators used these extensive powers in escalating fashion in response to the Bank’s widespread consumer abuses over the course of a decade and its failure to properly rectify its deficient risk management and oversight capabilities. On September 8, 2016, the CFPB and the OCC fined Wells Fargo $135 million for the widespread illegal practice of secretly opening deposit and credit card accounts without its customers’ authorizations. In addition, the CFPB and OCC mandated that Wells Fargo enter into coordinated consent orders aimed at preventing such misconduct from occurring in the future (the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders). The 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders required Wells Fargo to develop and implement an effective enterprise risk management program to detect and prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices and to mitigate further risks resulting from such practices. The Federal Reserve Imposes a Consent Order on Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo made minimal progress after the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders towards improving its oversight and risk management. In addition, the Bank’s illegal banking practices were found to be even more pervasive than originally determined. On February 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously to impose its own consent order against Wells Fargo, requiring the Bank to comprehensively overhaul its governance and risk management processes to ensure that these ugly and illegal practices could never run rampant throughout the Bank again (the 2018 FRB Consent Order). The written terms of the order were the result of weeks of negotiations between the Federal Reserve and Wells Fargo’s top executives, including Defendants Sloan, Shrewsberry, Duke, and Parker. In its 2018 FRB Consent Order, the Federal Reserve detailed a specific process through which Wells Fargo’s compliance would be measured, including benchmarks and timelines that the Bank would be required to meet before compliance could be claimed. Specifically, the Federal Reserve imposed three stages, outlined below, with specific, measurable, and time-bound parameters, that Wells Fargo needed to pass to comply with the 2018 FRB Consent Order. Stage 1: Approved Plans. By no later than April 3, 2018 (within sixty days (60) of the order), Wells Fargo was required to submit to the Federal Reserve written plans that are acceptable to the Reserve Bank. The Federal Reserve instructed that the Bank’s Stage 1 Plan needed to include a timeline for full implementation with specific deadlines for the completion of each component of the plans. The Stage 1 Plan also needed to document what the Bank would eventually implement and validate during the next two stages of the compliance process. The Stage 1 Plan was required to detail exactly how the Bank would institute an effective compliance and operational risk management program, as well as a program to ensure its Board effectively performed its duties to oversee and govern. The Federal Reserve made clear in its 2018 FRB Consent Order that the Bank could not advance to Stage 2 before submitting a compliant Stage 1 Plan and receiving the Federal Reserve’s approval. The 2018 FRB Consent Order specifically stated that Wells Fargo could advance to Stage 2 only after it was notified in writing that its Stage 1 Plan was acceptable to the Federal Reserve. Stage 2: Implementation. Once Wells Fargo complied with Stage 1, by submitting a compliant Stage 1 Plan that the Federal Reserve approved in writing, Wells Fargo was then required to move into adopting and then implementing the approved Stage 1 Plans to Federal Reserve’s satisfaction. As stated in the 2018 FRB Consent Order, in this second stage, the Bank shall adopt the approved plans from Stage 1 within 10 days of their approval by the Federal Reserve and then, [u]pon adoption [of the plans], WFC shall implement the approved plans and thereafter fully comply with them. Stage 3: Validation. After completing the approved Stage 1 Plan’s implementation, Wells Fargo was next required to engage a third party to complete an independent review of the effectiveness of the Bank’s adoption and implementation of the approved plans. As stated in the 2018 FRB Consent Order, in a section titled Third Party Reviews, [f]ollowing WFC’s adoption and implementation of the plans and improvement required under Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Order WFC shall conduct and complete by an appropriate date no later than September 30, 2018, an independent review of: (i) the Board’s improvements in effective oversight and governance of the [Bank], and (ii) enhancements to the [Bank]’s compliance and operational risk management program, each as required in this Order. On February 2, 2018, the same day the Federal Reserve announced the 2018 FRB Consent Order, Wells Fargo confirmed its understanding of the 2018 FRB Consent Order’s three distinct stages and its commitment to submitting the required plans in a timely fashion and to engage a third party to confirm adoption and implementation of the plans under the Federal Reserve’s timeline. The Bank also published an investor presentation the same day, explaining that once we adopt and implement these two plans as approved by the Federal Reserve, we will engage independent third parties. Again, during a March 7, 2018 presentation to investors, when an analyst questioned Wells Fargo’s management about the timeline for compliance with the FRB Consent Order, Wells Fargo summarized that first, under Stage 1, there was a requirement that we file a plan with the Federal Reserve within 60 days of the consent order, and then the Federal Reserve will make a determination as to whether or not our plan is adequate in the areas of operational risk, compliance and the board’s oversight of those activities. Next, under Stage 2, [w]e’ll then implement, once we’ve satisfied that they [the plans] are adequate and satisfied the Federal Reserve, we’ll implement those plans immediately. And finally, under Stage 3, we will engage a third-party to come in, and in effect, validate that we have adequately implemented those plans. To ensure the Bank’s most senior leadership was well aware of the work imposed by the Federal Reserve at each stage, the 2018 FRB Consent Order required Wells Fargo’s directors to sign the 2018 FRB Consent Order. Defendants Sloan and Duke, along with the entire then-current Board, signed the 2018 FRB Consent Order. The Federal Reserve also sent letters on February 2, 2018 to each current Wells Fargo director, including Defendants Sloan and Duke, reinforcing the need for the Bank to comply with the 2018 FRB Consent Order and reprimanding the Board for its past failures to meet our supervisory expectations. In those letters, the Federal Reserve cautioned the members of the Bank’s Board that it would continue to closely monitor the performance of WFC’s board in meeting supervisory expectations, including WFC’s compliance with today’s enforcement action, and further warned that it expected the Board to ensure that senior management establishes and maintains an effective risk management structure that has sufficient stature, authority, and resources. The Federal Reserve also took the extraordinary step of demanding that Wells Fargo replace three current Board members by April 2018 and a fourth Board member by the end of 2018. To ensure the engagement of the highest leadership of the Bank, the Federal Reserve further required in its 2018 FRB Consent Order that, going forward, Wells Fargo’s Board or an authorized committee thereof shall submit to the [Federal Reserve] written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the provisions of this Order and the results thereof. The Federal Reserve Limits Wells Fargo’s Growth with an Unprecedented Asset Cap. In addition to demanding sweeping reform, the 2018 FRB Consent Order included an unprecedented remedy: Wells Fargo was prohibited from increasing the size of its assets until it satisfied all three stages of the 2018 FRB Consent Order. In announcing this asset cap, the Federal Reserve chastised the Bank for having pursued a business strategy that prioritized its overall growth without ensuring appropriate management of all key risks. The Federal Reserve concluded that [t]he enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers. Until Wells Fargo satisfied the 2018 FRB Consent Order by completing the three stages, the cap on its assets would remain in place and limit Wells Fargo’s ability to grow. The Federal Reserve’s imposition of an asset cap was a devastating blow to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo’s largest source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the amount of interest income Wells Fargo generates on interest-earning assets (such as interest earned on lending activities to its customers) and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities (such as interest paid to customers on their deposits). Wells Fargo’s net interest income is adversely impacted by the asset cap. Without being able to increase interest-earnings assets, like loans, Wells Fargo cannot take advantage of interest-earning opportunities. This loss in revenue is exacerbated when, for example, federal interest rates are low, and the spread on the interest paid and interest earned decreases. To make up for the loss of interest revenue under such circumstances, Wells Fargo would need to increase the volume of its lending activities to offset the smaller spread—i.e., provide more loans at lower interest rates. Under the asset cap, however, Wells Fargo was prohibited from generating revenues in this manner because Wells Fargo would be required to increase the size of its assets to increase its loan volume—which is what the asset cap precluded. Analysts immediately recognized the adverse impact of the asset cap on the Bank’s financial strength. For example, Barclays issued an analyst report on February 4, 2018 titled, In an Unprecedented Move, the Fed Caps WFC’s Balance Sheet Growth Until Governance and Controls Are Improved, calling the asset cap severe and unprecedented and a constraint that no bank we have covered during our 22.5 years on the sell-side has experienced. Barclays analysts also described that the required balance sheet optimization activities to operate under the asset cap would clearly keep WFC in the penalty box and likely result in a reduction to net interest income. J.P. Morgan echoed these concerns on February 5, 2018, downgrading Wells Fargo’s stock because the harsh Fed consent order is rare and a strong sign of regulators’ frustration about the very wide swath of areas where Wells has had issues, and explaining that the net income impact could be larger than simple loss from shrinking institutional deposits to accommodate planned loan growth—Wells could lose other revenues, both existing and potential, that it was trying to garner from these clients. The financial press amplified these concerns. For example, on February 3, 2018, CNN Business noted that [i]t is the first time the Federal Reserve has imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution, explaining that the asset cap was an unprecedented punishment. Two days later, Bloomberg called the asset cap imposed upon Wells Fargo the Fed’s ‘Fear of God’ Penalty. It also reported how [a]nalysts at firms including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citi are slashing their ratings on Wells Fargo after the Federal Reserve devised harsh new punishments in the wake of the bank’s scandals. They’re pointing to hits to growth, earnings, business opportunities and the potential for other painful regulatory action yet to come. The OCC and CFPB Issue Additional Consent Orders and Historic Fines. Wells Fargo’s other two regulators—the OCC and CFPB—imposed additional coordinated consent orders on the Bank on April 20, 2018 (the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders and together with the 2018 FRB Consent Order, the 2018 Consent Orders), and fined the Bank over $1 billion for its continued failure to correct its risk management and oversight. As the OCC and CFPB explained, the Bank flouted the 2016 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders and continued to operate in a manner that was reckless, unsafe, or unsound and that violated federal banking and lending laws. The 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders required Wells Fargo to fix its compliance risk management and to remediate the harmed consumers. Like the 2018 FRB Consent Order, the OCC and CFPB provided detailed Action Plans within the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders, mandating that Wells Fargo pass through three stages to comply. Stage 1: Approved Plan. By no later than June 19, 2018 (within sixty days (60) of the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders), Wells Fargo was required to submit to the OCC and CFPB a compliant plan acceptable to the OCC and CFPB that documented the Bank’s actions to address compliance risk management. Then, by no later than August 18, 2018 (within one-hundred and twenty days (120) of the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders), Wells Fargo was required to submit a compliant plan documenting how it would implement a remediation program to identify and redress consumers harmed. These Stage 1 Plans were required to, among other things, contain a complete description of the actions necessary to achieve compliance with their stated requirements in this Consent Order and specify timelines for completion of the remedial actions to be implemented. Much like the 2018 FRB Consent Order, the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders stated that Wells Fargo could not proceed to the next stages of compliance until Wells Fargo receiv[ed] a written determination of no supervisory objection from the Examiner-in-Charge to the Stage 1 Plans. Stage 2: Implementation. After completing Stage 1, as evidenced by the OCC’s and CFPB’s written determination of no objection to the proposed Stage 1 Plans, Wells Fargo was required to execute and implement the accepted plans. Specifically, after the Bank received notification from the CFPB of its determination of non-objection to the Stage 1 Plans, Wells Fargo was then required to implement and adhere to the steps, recommendations, deadlines, and timeframes outlined in the compliance and redress plan. Similarly, the OCC also mandated that [u]pon receiving a written determination of no supervisory objection from the OCC, the Board shall ensure the Bank executes and thereafter adheres to the Plans. Moreover, the OCC instructed that, [i]n the course of executing the Plans, the Bank shall not take any action that will cause a significant deviation from, or material change to, the Plans, unless and until the Bank has received a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the Deputy Comptroller. Stage 3: Validation. Once the Bank implemented its plans in Stage 2, the Bank was then required to validate the implementation and execution of the plan and submit a report to the CFPB and OCC summarizing the results of that validation. The OCC specified that [t]he Bank shall not be considered to be in compliance with the remediation requirements until such time that the OCC has determined that the Bank is in compliance with the Articles of the 2018 OCC Consent Order that detailed the three stages. The OCC and CFPB once again ensured that Wells Fargo’s highest leadership would be deeply involved in compliance with the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders, mandating that Wells Fargo’s Board review all submissions (including plans, reports, programs, policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order before submission to the Bureau. The OCC and CFPB also sent a strong message to the Bank’s Board that the ultimate responsibility for the Bank’s compliance with the 2018 OCC/CFPB Consent Orders lay with the directors, including Defendants Sloan and Duke, with the CFPB stating that: In each instance that this Consent Order requires the Board to ensure adherence to, or perform certain obligations of [the Bank], it is intended to mean the Board shall require timely reporting by [Bank] management of such actions directed by the Board to be taken under this Order, among other items. The Defendants understood and acknowledged that compliance with these regulatory directives was critically important to, not only the Bank’s operations and financial soundness, but its survival. For example, Defendant Duke expressed in an internal February 19, email to the Bank’s Chief Risk Officer that Wells Fargo’s credibility and perhaps even viability as a company is dependent on successfully exiting these consent orders along with the new Fed C[onsent] O[rder] in 2019. Defendant Sloan, in his March 9, 2019 written testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, likewise acknowledged that fully satisfying the requirements set forth in our regulatory consent orders is critically important. Compliance with the 2018 Consent Orders. Investors, analysts, and commentators were intently focused on the Bank’s compliance with the 2018 Consent Orders throughout the Class Period. During numerous investor calls, media appearances, and news interviews, Defendants fielded questions about Wells Fargo’s satisfaction of the requirements of the 2018 Consent Orders. In response, they assured investors that they were in compliance with the 2018 Consent Orders’ requirements, had approved Stage Plans, and were implementing those plans in accordance with the 2018 Consent Orders—i.e., the Bank was past Stage 1 of the 2018 Consent Orders. Unknown to investors at the time, Defendants’ representations were knowingly or recklessly false, misleading, and omitted material facts, and were designed to falsely and misleadingly bolster investor confidence in the Bank’s compliance. As discussed further below, Defendants’ statements concealed that the Bank’s Stage 1 Plan submissions were consistently rejected by the Regulators, Defendants never progressed to the execution or implementation stage of the 2018 Consent Orders, and Defendants were repeatedly reprimanded for flouting the Regulators’ and the 2018 Consent Orders’ clear directives. The Bank’s top directors and executives each received in real-time a steady stream of rejection letters and stern rebukes from the Regulators. Each of these executives knew of the Regulators’ rejections of the Bank’s Stage Plans and threats of further enforcement action, yet falsely and misleadingly assured worried investors and analysts that the Bank was in the midst of implementing or, even worse, had already implemented the plans in compliance with the 2018 Consent Orders. Despite Numerous Rejection Letters and Stern Rebukes from the Bank’s Regulators, Defendants Falsely and Misleadingly Tell Investors that the Bank has Compliant Plans In Place and is Already Executing Those Plans. Under the 2018 FRB Consent Order, as detailed above in Section IV.A.2, Wells Fargo was required to submit a compliant Stage 1 Plan by April 3, 2018. The Stage 1 Plan, which required the Federal Reserve’s approval, was required to detail how the Bank would improve Board oversight and operational risk management and, specifically, to include a timeline for full implementation with specific deadlines"

      "summary": "Lead plaintiffs RTD Bros LLC, Todd Benn, Tom Benn, and Tomasz Rzedzian, and additional plaintiff Preston Million, bring this putative class action against defendants Lottery.com, Inc., formerly known as Trident Acquisitions Corp. (“TDAC”), and certain of its current and former officers and directors. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Lottery’s regulatory compliance, financial results, and internal controls, in violation of federal securities laws. Lottery is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices in Spicewood, Texas. Prior to October 29, 2021, Lottery was known as TDAC, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) with its principal executive offices in New York City. TDAC was formed on March 17, 2016, for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar business combination. TDAC filed its initial public offering prospectus with the SEC on May 30, 2018. The IPO prospectus stated that TDAC intended to focus its efforts on seeking a business combination with an oil and gas or other natural resources company in Eastern Europe or interested in expanding into Eastern Europe. TDAC’s directors and officers held themselves out to investors as highly experienced in industrial businesses in Eastern Europe, in particular in the energy sector. The IPO prospectus did not disclose whether any of its directors or officers had any experience with online technology companies or lotteries. In fact, TDAC’s directors and officers had no meaningful experience in these subjects. TDAC’s only three employees were its executive officers, all of whom claimed to be qualified and experienced in the oil and gas industries. TDAC was led by Ponomarev, whom TDAC repeatedly touted as experienced in the energy industries and working in Eastern Europe. As the deadline to complete a business combination approached, TDAC sought and obtained three extensions of the deadline, and each time, a portion of shareholders sought to redeem their shares, thus depleting TDAC’s trust account. On November 19, 2020, with another business combination deadline fast approaching, TDAC announced that it had signed a letter of intent to combine with Lottery, which was then a private company. Founded in 2015, AutoLotto, Inc., doing business as Lottery.com, was an Austin, Texas-based company. Lottery represented itself to be: (1) a leading online platform to play the lottery, offering official state-sanctioned lottery games like Powerball, Mega-Millions and other state games, in the U.S. and around the world; and (2) the world’s largest provider of lottery data – such as current and previous winning numbers, jackpots and draw dates, jackpot analysis and more, covering almost 600 lottery games in 38 countries in real time – to over 400 digital publishers, including hundreds of digital newspapers, television and news sites, and major digital publishers such as Google, Verizon/Yahoo, Amazon’s Alexa devices and more. TDAC’s announcement regarding a letter of intent with Lottery disclosed that the transaction would be structured so that Lottery’s stockholders would roll 100% of their equity into the business combination, with no minimum cash requirement, and that the parties anticipated closing the business combination in first quarter of 2021. Thereafter, on November 30, 2020, TDAC held a special meeting of stockholders, pursuant to which the stockholders approved the extension from December 1, 2020, to March 1, 2021, with an ability to further extend for an additional three months to June 1, 2021, if approved by the board of directors. On February 26, 2021, the board of directors approved the extension to June 1, 2021, to permit sufficient time to consummate the proposed business combination with Lottery. On May 27, 2021, the stockholders approved a further extension from June 1, 2021, to September 1, 2021, with the ability to further extend for an additional three months to December 1, 2021, if approved by the board of directors. On October 29, 2021, the company announced the completion of the business combination, and upon the closing, the combined entity was renamed Lottery.com. On November 1, 2021, Lottery’s common shares and warrants began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbols “LTRY” and “LTRYW,” respectively. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of all persons and entities, other than defendants, who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of Lottery during the period from November 19, 2020, through July 29, 2022. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased Lottery’s securities at artificially inflated prices during the class period and were damaged upon the revelation of the alleged corrective disclosures. Plaintiffs also allege that they held common stock of TDAC as of October 28, 2021, eligible to vote at TDAC’s October 28, 2021, special meeting. Plaintiffs allege that defendants misrepresented and/or omitted to disclose material facts to investors regarding the financial and operational health of the company, including with respect to the company’s cash position, its regulatory compliance, the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting, all of which were critical to investors. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Lottery’s regulatory compliance, financial results, and internal controls, in violation of federal securities laws. Plaintiffs allege that these misrepresentations and omissions were made to drum up support for the business combination and maintain the illusion that the company had significant revenue growth and adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Plaintiffs allege that defendants’ wrongful conduct directly and proximately caused the economic loss suffered by plaintiffs and the class. Plaintiffs allege that the price of Lottery’s securities significantly declined when the misrepresentations made to the market and/or the effects thereof were revealed or materialized, on November 15, 2021, July 6, 2022, July 18, 2022, July 25, 2022, and July 29, 2022. Plaintiffs also allege that TDAC shareholders who were eligible to vote on the business combination and/or exercise their redemption rights have also been damaged as a result of the materially false and/or misleading statements about Lottery’s operations and financial results. Had the true financial condition and operations of Lottery been known, members of the class eligible to vote on the business combination would have voted against the business combination and/or exercised their redemption rights and received $10.94 in cash per share of TDAC stock. The operative complaint asserts claims for: (1) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants; (2) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants; (3) violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 against all defendants; and (4) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Spectrum is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Its common stock trades on the NASDAQ. According to the CAC, Spectrum’s primary strategy is to acquire, develop, and commercialize novel and targeted oncology therapies. At the time of the events giving rise to this action, Spectrum purportedly had two drugs in late-stage development: poziotinib (pozi) and eflapegrastim (branded Rolontis). Defendant Riga was appointed the Company’s President and CEO and a member of the Company’s board of directors effective December 31, 2021, and served in those roles throughout the Class Period. During the period March 18, 2022 through May 25, 2022 (which was the effective date of Defendant Brennan’s appointment), Defendant Riga served as Interim Principal Financial Officer of the Company. At the time he was appointed CEO, he was serving as the Company’s Chief Commercial Officer (“CCO”) and Chief Operating Officer (“COO”). Defendant Riga joined the Company in July 2013 as Vice President of Corporate Accounts and was named CCO in August 2014 and COO in December 2017. He made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts he had a duty to disclose in Spectrum’s SEC filings, press releases or on public conference calls with analysts and investors during the Class Period. Defendant Lebel was appointed CMO on November 18, 2018 and was the Company’s EVP and CMO throughout the Class Period. Effective December 31, 2022, he resigned from his positions with the Company. He made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts he had a duty to disclose in Spectrum’s SEC filings, press releases or on public conference calls with analysts and investors during the Class Period. During the Class Period, Defendant Lebel sold a total of 15,335 shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of over $14,000. Defendant Brennan was appointed as the Company’s CFO and EVP on May 11, 2022, effective May 25, 2022. Prior to being appointed CFO, Defendant Brennan served on Spectrum’s Board of Directors and as Chairperson of the Audit Committee since December 2020. She made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts she had a duty to disclose in Spectrum’s SEC filings during the Class Period. During the Class Period, Defendant Brennan sold 3,569 shares of Spectrum common stock for proceeds of $2,819.51. Defendants Riga, Lebel and Brennan (the “Individual Defendants”), as senior executives of Spectrum, acted within the scope of their respective authority and as agents of Spectrum during the Class Period. The Individual Defendants, because of their respective positions with the Company, possessed the power and authority to control the contents of the Company’s reports to the SEC, press releases, and representations and presentations to securities analysts, money and portfolio managers, and institutional and individual investors, i.e. the market. They were provided with copies of the Company’s reports and press releases alleged herein to be misleading prior to, or shortly after, their issuance and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or cause them to be corrected. Before any new drug can be marketed and sold commercially in the U.S., the FDA requires that the drug undergo pre-clinical (animal) trials, and clinical trials involving three phases of human testing, with each phase involving increasingly larger patient pools. During pre-clinical testing stage, laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug against the targeted disease. The compound is evaluated for safety. After certain pre-clinical studies are completed, an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) is submitted to the FDA to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug. An IND becomes effective thirty days after the FDA receives the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold), or upon prior notification by the FDA. Phase 1 Clinical Trials: These trials typically involve small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients and usually define a drug candidate’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range. Phase 2 Clinical Trials: In Phase 2 clinical trials, controlled studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug’s effectiveness. These studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels, dose schedules and route(s) of administration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans, as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following Phase 1. These clinical trials, and Phase 3 trials discussed below, are designed to evaluate the product’s overall benefit- risk profile, and to provide information for physician labeling. Phase 3 Clinical Trials: This Phase usually involves a larger number of patients with the targeted disease. Investigators (typically physicians) monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate’s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long-term use of the drug on a large, more widespread, patient population. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease in a randomized trial where some patients are treated with the drug candidate, and some are treated with a placebo or a standard treatment. New Drug Application: After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicate that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA is filed with the FDA requesting FDA approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease. The AA pathway aims to speed the regular drug approval process outlined above on the basis of Phase 1 or 2 study data results relating to a surrogate endpoint deemed reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or an intermediate clinical end point other than irreversible illness or death. AA may be sought for drugs that treat a serious condition and provide a meaningful advantage over available therapies. According to the FDA’s Guidance for Industry, Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics (May 2014), a drug sponsor should ordinarily discuss the possibility of AA with the review division during development, supporting, for example, the use of the planned endpoint as a basis for approval and discussing confirmatory trials, which should usually be already underway at the time of AA. For drugs granted AA, postmarketing confirmatory trials (also called postmarketing requirements, or PMR) have been required to verify clinical benefit, and these additional trials must be completed with due diligence. The FDA has interpreted the due diligence requirement to mean that the postmarketing trial intended to verify the clinical benefit must be conducted promptly to facilitate determination, as soon as possible, of whether clinical benefit has been verified or not verified. A May 6, 2021 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (“NEJM”) titled “‘Dangling’ Accelerated Approval in Oncology” that was authored by two FDA officials, Dr. Julia A. Beaver4 and Dr. Richard Pazdur5 stated that “[t]o improve their timely completion, confirmatory trials should be ongoing, if not fully enrolled, at the time of accelerated approval.” Both Dr. Beaver and Dr. Pazdur were involved in the review of the Pozi NDA and the ODAC meeting at the end of the Class Period, as alleged below. If a drug is granted AA and marketed for use in patients, a delay in the timely completion of a confirmatory trial represents the greatest risk to patients. The FDA desires that drug sponsors provide sufficient evidence of effectiveness and adequate of assurance of safety, while expediting access to drugs and minimizing the time between AA and demonstration of Julia A. Beaver M.D. (“Dr. Beaver”) was Chief of Medical Oncology, of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence (“OCE”), Deputy Director (Acting) of the Office of Oncologic Diseases (“OOD”) and the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). Richard Pazdur, M.D. (“Dr. Pazdur”) was the Director of OCE, Director (Acting) of ODD, Office of New Drugs (“OND”) and CDER. clinical benefit or lack of clinical benefit. Exon 20 Mutations NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. The main difference between NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) is the way the cells appear under a microscope. SCLC cells appears as flat and smaller than cancer cells in NSCLC. SCLC typically grows faster than NSCLC and often spreads to the lymph nodes. Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. Receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTKs”) are a type of enzyme that regulate cellular functions, including cell growth and metabolism. HER2 is a type of RTK and is present on cell membranes of cells in the lungs. Mutations or insertions in HER2 can lead to NSCLC. According to Spectrum, up to 86% of the HER2 tumor-causing mutations are exon 20 insertions, which represents approximately 3,000 newly diagnosed patients per year in the U.S. Pozi is purportedly a novel, oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (“TKI”), including HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Pozi purportedly has a unique structure that inhibits certain cellular activity linked to cancer. Pozi is administered orally. TKIs like pozi are targeted treatments, unlike chemotherapy and other cancer treatments toxic to cells. On or around July 28, 2017, Spectrum submitted an IND for pozi to the FDA. Spectrum initiated a clinical development program for pozi called ZENITH20 (Study SPI-POZ- 202) to study pozi for different indications or exploratory purposes and ultimately comprised 7 cohorts. Cohort 2 was a stand-alone, independent Phase 2 study concerning the efficacy and safety of pozi at a dose of 16 mg QD in previously treated (second-line) NSCLC patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. The primary endpoint of Cohort 2 was objective response rate, or ORR (which measured complete or partial decrease in the size of tumor or cancer). Optimized Spectrum’s dose selection of 16 mg QD was based on a preliminary Phase 1 study conducted in South Korea involving approximately 20 patients (the “Phase 1 Study”). The Phase Study dosed three patients at 12 mg QD, seven to eight patients at 16 mg QD, six patients at 18 mg QD, and three patients at 24 mg QD. On or around July 28, 2017, unknown to investors, the FDA communicated concerns to Spectrum that the 16 mg QD dose was not optimized. Dose optimization is essential to ensure that patients receive therapies which maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Because the Phase 1 Study involved few patients, the FDA determined that there were very limited safety and preliminary activity data available. The FDA further determined that the insufficient study data results from the Phase 1 Study were not adequate to differentiate the risk-benefit profile of the clinically active dose range (12mg to 16 mg per day) in the proposed patient population. The FDA made clear to Spectrum that the Phase 1 Study did not support dose optimization for pozi. The FDA reiterated concerns to Spectrum during the pozi development program and throughout the Class Period that Spectrum did not have adequate study data results that confirmed optimal dose selection. On February 27, 2020, Defendants Spectrum and Lebel disclosed that Cohort 2 was fully enrolled and that top-line results were expected by mid-2020. All Cohort 2 patients were treated with 16 mg QD. On May 7, 2020, Defendants Spectrum and Lebel disclosed that Spectrum would study additional dosing schedules beyond the 16mg QD due to high rates of dose interruptions. In an exploratory study (Cohort 5), patients would receive 10 mg QD, or 6 or 8 mg BID. On July 27, 2020, Defendants Spectrum and Lebel stated that Cohort 2 met its pre- specified endpoint. The ORR was 27.8% and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval exceeded the pre-specified criterion of 17%. Defendants Spectrum and Lebel also stated the results of secondary endpoints: the median duration of response (“DOR”) was 5.1 months, the disease control rate (“DCR”) was 70%, and median progression free survival was 5.5 months. On November 9, 2020, Defendant Lebel met with the FDA in a telephonic Type B Pre-NDA meeting to discuss the adequacy of the safety and efficacy results from Cohort 2 during which Defendant Lebel presented top-line data from Cohort 2. The FDA determined that Spectrum could submit an NDA for pozi under the FDA’s AA pathway for substantive review, however, unknown to investors, the FDA reiterated to Defendant Lebel the FDA’s ongoing concerns regarding the efficacy and safety data, inadequate dose selection data and the FDA requested additional data on dose optimization be provided in the NDA. Adequate Data to Optimize the 16 mg QD Dose On July 16, 2021, Defendant Lebel participated in a Type C guidance meeting with the FDA to discuss Spectrum’s planned confirmatory trial and whether the BID dosing from the ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5) could be submitted with the Pozi NDA. The FDA reiterated concerns about the dosing data from Cohort 2 and that it was not known based on Spectrum’s study data if alternative dosages provided similar effectiveness compared to the 16 mg QD dose. While the initial dosage in Cohort 2 was 16 mg QD, due to dose interruptions from adverse events (89% of patients), most patients (74%) received dosages of 12 mg daily or less. FDA agreed with the inclusion of data from the ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5) in the Pozi NDA and recommended that Spectrum pool all study data from completed trials and perform analyses of the data to justify that 8 mg BID was the optimum biologic dosage and schedule. In addition to data from Cohort 2 and the ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5), Spectrum had data on NSCLC patients treated with 16 mg QD or 8 mg BID from an investigator- sponsored study and from other ZENITH20 cohorts. On October 1, 2021, Spectrum submitted the first portion of the rolling submission of the Pozi NDA under the AA pathway. During a Spectrum earnings conference call with investors on November 10, 2021 in which Defendant Lebel participated, an analyst asked Defendant Lebel “what confirmatory study are you committing to in terms of design? Because obviously you need to do that as part of the [] approval? In response, Defendant Lebel stated: . . . we’re in discussion with the [FDA] regarding this, and we clearly have developed a PMR [(post-marketing requirement, i.e. PINNACLE)]. And when you file the NDA, you have to have a PMR essentially underway and so we absolutely intend to do that. But obviously, want to make sure we’re in complete agreement . . . as to the nature of the PMR. So I’m not going to go any further on that, but it’s probably a randomized controlled study . . . And we’ll need to define that with the [FDA] and probably quite soon, you will be able to see what we’re doing. (Emphasis added). On November 24, 2021, Spectrum submitted the final components of the Pozi NDA to the FDA. Defendants Spectrum and Lebel sought AA approval of the 16 mg pozi QD dose based on the Cohort 2 study data results, despite the fact that, since 2017, the FDA reiterated concerns that Spectrum did not have adequate data to justify the 16 mg QD dose. The Pozi NDA also included the additional dosing data from the ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5) that Defendant Lebel discussed at the July 16, 2021 meeting with FDA officials as supportive data to justify dosing patients at lower doses than 16 mg QD. The ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5) was treating patients with lower doses of pozi, including 6 and 8 mg BID, in very limited numbers and was studying a mix of NSCLC patients, only some of whom were like the patients treated in Cohort 2 (i.e., second-line NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 mutations). PINNACLE Study In November 2021, the FDA began its formal review of the Pozi NDA and, as one FDA official disclosed after the Class Period, the concerns that the FDA had previously expressed to Defendants Spectrum and Lebel were “confirmed and magnified”. Days later, on December 13, 2021, Defendant Lebel participated in a Type B Pre- phase 3 meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed design of the PINNACLE Study. For the PINNACLE Study, Defendant Lebel proposed a dosage regimen of 16 mg QD for 2 weeks followed by 8 mg BID or 6 mg BID. The FDA raised concerns that the data submitted with the Pozi NDA was inadequate and that it was not known if alternative dosages provided similar effectiveness compared to the 16 mg QD dosage, and stated that additional dosing data were needed to determine whether the pozi dose was optimized for further evaluation in the PINNACLE Study. Specifically, the FDA indicated to Defendant Lebel that Spectrum should evaluate the 6 mg BID dose in one or more confirmatory trials, potentially conducted as a run-in phase, and that the 8 mg BID dose as the starting dose was preferable to 16 mg QD that Spectrum proposed. A run-in phase study would occur before the confirmatory trial, adding both time and expense to the pozi development program. Spectrum and FDA did not reach an agreement on the design of the PINNACLE Study due to the inadequate optimization study data and incongruent dosing regimens proposed by Defendant Lebel. On February 7, 2022, Defendants Riga and/or Lebel participated in a Type B End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss Spectrum’s design for PINNACLE to treat patients with an 8 mg BID dosage. The FDA requested additional efficacy data from patients enrolled in the ongoing exploratory study (Cohort 5) to further analyze the antitumor activity of pozi 8 mg BID. The FDA expressed concern about the delay in the initiation of the PINNACLE Study and emphasized the need to begin enrollment as soon as possible. Further, the FDA reiterated its concerns regarding top line efficacy results, lack of dosage optimization, delayed confirmatory trial status, and the safety profile of pozi. The FDA and Spectrum did not reach an agreement on the design of the PINNACLE Study. On February 11, 2022, Defendants Riga and Lebel caused Spectrum to issue a press release titled “Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Announces Acceptance of New Drug Application Filing for Poziotinib” that stated the following: The NDA acceptance is based on the positive Phase 2 study results in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. There is currently no treatment specifically approved by the FDA for this indication. The product has received Fast Track designation and the agency has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of November 24, 2022. The FDA reiterated the importance of having the confirmatory trial substantially enrolled at the time of approval and requested additional information around dosing. . . . The Class Period begins on March 17, 2022, when, during Spectrum’s conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter 2021 and full year 2021 financial results, Defendant Riga, while knowing, or at least recklessly disregarding that the FDA repeatedly told Defendants Lebel and/or Riga that Spectrum’s dose optimization data was inadequate and that additional data and studies were needed to"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Defendant DocGo is a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices located in New York. DocGo offers medical transportation and mobile health services in the United States and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2023, DocGo had 104,055,168 shares of common stock outstanding. DocGo’s common stock trades in an efficient market on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DCGO.” Defendant Vashovsky co-founded DocGo and served as DocGo’s CEO until January 2023. Vashovsky has served as the Chairman of DocGo’s Board of Directors since 2015. Defendant Capone joined Ambulnz, Inc. in 2017 and served as Ambulnz’s President, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Product Officer from 2017 until DocGo’s merger with Ambulnz in 2021. Capone served as DocGo’s President until January 2023. Capone served as DocGo’s CEO from January 2023 until his abrupt resignation in September 2023. Defendant Oberholzer served as DocGo’s CFO from 2015 until January 2023. In January 2023, Oberholzer became DocGo’s Treasurer and Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. During the Class Period, the Individual Defendants, as senior executive officers and/or directors of DocGo, were privy to confidential, proprietary information concerning DocGo, its finances, operations, financial condition, and present and future business prospects. The Individual Defendants also had access to material adverse nonpublic information concerning DocGo. Because of their positions with the Company, the Individual Defendants had access to nonpublic information about its finances, business, markets, products, and present and future business prospects via internal corporate documents, conversations, and connections with other corporate officers and employees, via attendance at management and/or Board meetings and committees thereof, and via reports and other information provided to them in connection therewith. Because of their possession of such information, the Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the adverse facts specified herein had not been disclosed to, and were being concealed from, the investing public. The Individual Defendants are liable as direct participants in the wrongs complained of herein. In addition, the Individual Defendants, by reason of their status as senior executive officers and/or directors, were “controlling persons” within the meaning of §20(a) of the 1934 Act and had the power and influence to cause the Company to engage in the unlawful conduct complained of herein. Because of their positions of control, the Individual Defendants were able to, and did, directly or indirectly, control the conduct of DocGo’s business. The Individual Defendants, because of their positions with the Company, controlled and/or possessed the ability and authority to control the contents of DocGo’s reports, press releases, and presentations to securities analysts and, through them, to the investing public. The Individual Defendants were provided with copies of the Company’s reports and press releases alleged herein to be misleading, prior to or shortly after their issuance, and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or cause them to be corrected. Thus, the Individual Defendants had the opportunity to commit the fraudulent acts alleged herein. As senior executive officers and/or directors and as controlling persons of a publicly traded company whose stock was, and is, registered with the NASDAQ and governed by the federal securities laws, the Individual Defendants had a duty to promptly disseminate accurate and truthful information with respect to DocGo’s financial condition, performance, growth, operations, financial statements, business, products, markets, management, earnings, and present and future business prospects, and to correct any previously issued statements that had become materially misleading or untrue, so that the market price of DocGo stock would be based upon truthful and accurate information. The Individual Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions during the Class Period violated these specific requirements and obligations. The Individual Defendants are liable as participants in a fraudulent scheme and course of conduct that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of DocGo securities. The scheme: (a) deceived the investing public regarding DocGo’s business, operations, and management and the intrinsic value of DocGo securities; and (b) caused Lead Plaintiff and members of the Class to purchase DocGo securities at artificially inflated prices. DocGo provides healthcare transportation and mobile services for hospitals and health systems, health plans, governments, and municipalities in the United States and the United Kingdom. DocGo markets itself as a technology company and a leading provider of mobile healthcare services. DocGo began as Motion Acquisition Corp., a blank check company formed by business executives in the transportation software and technology sector. Motion completed its IPO on October 19, 2020. Motion’s business objective, as stated in its IPO offering documents, was “to identify, acquire and operate a business in the telematics industry,” an interdisciplinary field encompassing telecommunications, vehicular technologies, electrical engineering, and computer science. On January 6, 2021, Motion signed a letter of intent to combine with Ambulnz, which was then a private company. On March 9, 2021, Motion and Ambulnz announced they had entered into the Business Combination agreement on March 8, 2021. On October 14, 2021, Motion filed with the SEC a final proxy for the merger recommending shareholders vote in favor of the Business Combination. On November 2, 2021, Motion shareholders approved the Business Combination. On November 5, 2021, Motion and Ambulnz issued a release announcing the completion of the Business Combination. Ambulnz was merged with and into a subsidiary of Motion, with Motion as the surviving entity, and Motion’s named changed to DocGo Inc. Motion also assumed the business and operations of Ambulnz, allowing Ambulnz to become publicly traded as DocGo. During the Class Period, DocGo had two business segments: Transportation Services and Mobile Health. DocGo’s Transportation Services segment provided emergency response and nonemergency transportation services offered under the Ambulnz brand (a wholly-owned subsidiary of DocGo after the Business Combination). DocGo’s Mobile Health segment provided healthcare at home and offices, testing, vaccinations, and event services, including onsite healthcare support at sporting events and concerts. The Company’s mobile health services included onsite evaluation, diagnostics, triage, and treatment. Throughout and prior to the Class Period, DocGo promoted itself as a technology company positioned at the intersection of healthcare and technology. According to Capone: “DocGo, when you look at its heart, is really a technology company. From day one when we built the company, that was going to be our focus.” Critical to DocGo’s messaging on technology was AI. While DocGo was promoting itself as a technology company, AI experience and capabilities were increasingly being recognized as important differentiators, particularly for high growth and startup companies. According to a September 27, 2021 Harvard Business Review article titled: “AI Adoption Skyrocketed Over the Last 18 Months,” startups were “targeting established industries by employing the latest data-driven technologies to enter new markets with new solutions.” And growth in the AI healthcare market was projected to skyrocket. As noted in a July 11, 2023 IBM.com article titled: “How can artificial intelligence benefit healthcare?,” the AI healthcare market, “valued at $11 billion in 2021, is projected to be worth $187 billion in 2030. That massive increase means we will likely continue to see considerable changes in how medical providers, hospitals, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and others in the healthcare industry operate.” At the same time, many companies were finding it hard to attract employees with necessary AI experience. According to a McKinsey article titled: “The state of AI in 2022 – and a half decade in review”: Unfortunately, the tech talent shortage shows no sign of easing, threatening to slow that shift for some companies. A majority of respondents report difficulty in hiring for each AI-related role in the past year, and most say it either wasn’t any easier or was more difficult to acquire this talent than in years past. AI data scientists remain particularly scarce, with the largest share of respondents rating data scientist as a role that has been difficult to fill . . . . Against this backdrop, DocGo sought to capitalize on the growing AI wave. DocGo’s “technology backbone” purportedly was a proprietary central AI system that managed the logistics behind DocGo’s scheduling, patient interactions, and resource allocation. Based on the Company’s representations, analysts believed DocGo’s AI technology platform to be the Company’s largest differentiator in ambulance services and mobile health. Needham & Company, which covered DocGo during the Class Period, described DocGo’s proprietary AI platform as the Company’s “secret sauce.” On June 21, 2023 Canaccord Genuity, which also covered DocGo during the Class Period, wrote: “To be clear, the technology platform is the largest differentiator for DocGo with management emphatically defining itself as a technology company.” On August 18, 2023, BTIG, which also covered DocGo during the Class Period, wrote: DCGO’s underlying advanced proprietary technology is the core of the company and drives DCGO’s value. Its platform is also the key differentiator that gives it an edge over competitors. * * * DCGO has framed itself as a tech company that is at the cross-section between healthcare and technology. Critical to the Company’s purported technology platform were Capone and his education in AI. For example, on March 15, 2023, at an Oppenheimer Healthcare Conference, Capone specifically linked DocGo’s “technology backbone” to his personal background: Now, again, the whole piece that we have is on top of our technology backbone. That technology backbone allows for the procurement, the dispatching, the automation of our services. And to emphasize again, DocGo’s technology is at the same level [a]s the best technology companies in the world. Although we are a services company where we deliver, we derive nearly all of our revenue from services, clinical services provided in the field. The technology that we have is of the same caliber of some of the true technology companies that sell technology, that is what they make their money from. Part of that’s due to the fact that that’s my background. That’s kind of where I’m heavily weighted towards. And so, every solution – every problem that we have, we answer with a technology solution. We deploy code [to] production six to seven times every single day, millions and millions of lines of code doing highly sophisticated AI-based solutions that do all the routing, the dispatching, and the predictive analytics to know who you dispatch to, where, and why. Indeed, throughout and prior to the Class Period, Capone repeatedly highlighted his purported graduate degree in computational learning theory to investors, customers, and the public in an effort to boost DocGo’s prospects and capabilities. On June 16, 2021, Vashovsky and Capone submitted a “Proposal to the New Jersey Department of Health Office of the Commissioner (the “Proposal”) on behalf of Ambulnz, DocGo’s medical transportation subsidiary. The Proposal included Capone’s résumé, which stated that Capone had earned a Masters of Computational Learning Theory from Clarkson University in May 2014. The Proposal also represented Capone had earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, and a Bachelor of Arts in Law – each “Sum Cum Laude” – from SUNY Potsdam in May 2009: Capone frequently highlighted his supposed academic pedigree when speaking to investors, expressly connecting his advanced degree in AI to the foundational strengths of the Company. For example, on September 13, 2022, while President of DocGo, Capone stated at an H.C. Wainwright Global Investment Conference: So Stan [Vashovsky] came in. Clinical background: paramedic for 28 years, had been in health care for almost that entire time. My background: I originally – when we started the company, I’m our Chief – was our Chief Technology Officer. My graduate degree is in computational learning theory, which was a subset of artificial intelligence. And so we brought those two together. We melded this need on the medical side with the understanding that I had on the computer science side, and, together, we built that. The next day, on September 14, 2022, at a Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference, Capone again emphasized his graduate degree in computational learning theory to investors: My name is Anthony Capone, currently the President at DocGo. Originally, when we formed the company, I was our Chief Technology Officer. That’s kind of where my background is in. My grad degree is in computational learning theory, which is a discrete subset of computer science, artificial intelligence. On November 7, 2022, DocGo issued a release announcing Vashovsky was retiring as CEO. DocGo’s Board appointed Capone as CEO, effective January 1, 2023. In the release, Vashovsky stated: “I am extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish as a company these past seven years, introducing an entirely novel way of delivering quality care that is beneficial to both patients and payers alike. We are very fortunate to have someone with Anthony’s skill set and track record to take the reigns [sic] as CEO next year, and I have every confidence in the continued growth and success of this company.” However, at no time before appointing Capone as CEO did Vashovsky or the rest of DocGo’s Board bother to verify the accuracy of Capone’s educational credentials. After the Board appointed Capone as CEO, Capone continued to tout his credentials in the rapidly expanding field of AI to investors. For example on January 12, 2023, at a JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Capone stated: My name is Anthony Capone, as introduced there. I’m Chief Executive Officer. We started the company about 6.5 years ago; I was our Chief Technology Officer. My background, my grad degree is in computational learning theory, which is a subset of AI. So I’m on the technology side. And as I’ll go through, our founder is on the clinical side, and we bring the two together to deliver a true, true healthcare service that’s built on top of very sophisticated technology backbone. Later in the same presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Capone again touted his academic credentials: Now one of the key parts, and I like to talk about this quite a lot because it’s my background, my graduate degree is in computational learning theory, is our technology. Everybody says they have technology. Everybody has got some app that they like to have. This is not that. Capone also repeatedly inserted references to his credentials into messaging about the AI capabilities of DocGo. On August 9, 2023, at a Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference, Capone stated: We started the company. I was our Chief Technology Officer, my graduate degree [is] in computational learning theory, which is a subset of artificial intelligence and all of the tech that we have at DocGo whether that tech [is] to distribute, dispersed, dispatch, thousands and thousands of people every single day to varying different settings across the entire globe, or whether that’s the ability to pair together the medical necessity of a patient with a clinical competency of a provider, all of that is done with high sophistication, with our AI systems in order to need as little people as possible. Unbeknownst to investors, however, Capone had not earned a graduate degree in computational learning theory or any other field of study from Clarkson University or any other institution. In fact, Capone had never even enrolled in any graduate program at Clarkson University. Nor had Capone earned a triple summa cum laude undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam. On September 14, 2023, Albany’s Times Union published an article titled: “DocGo CEO Anthony Capone admits he didn’t earn graduate degree.” In the article, Capone admitted he had never earned any master’s degree and refused to confirm that he even held an undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam, let alone a triple summa cum laude degree, as he had previously represented. Capone’s admission that he had fabricated parts of his résumé was itself false and misleading as it suggested only that his “public biography” was erroneous when in fact Capone had systematically lied about his education time and again to investors, customers, and the public. The next day, on September 15, 2023, DocGo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, announcing Capone’s “resignation.” Though DocGo originated as Ambulnz, with a focus on medical transportation, the Company’s Mobile Health segment grew dramatically through 2020, 2021, and 2022. DocGo reported Mobile Health revenues of $234.4 million in 2021 and $325.9 million in 2022. By the first quarter of 2023, the Mobile Health segment comprised over 69% of the Company’s business. Within DocGo’s Mobile Health segment, the Company had a number of different segments, or “verticals,” including governments, payers, hospitals, and events. DocGo’s government vertical was the Company’s largest by a significant margin. As Capone stated at a March 7, 2023 Cowen Health Care Conference: “Our government vertical is the largest. That’s over 60% of our revenue. And that’s what we call population health. So we go to large municipalities. These are very large contracts when you win them.” The growth in DocGo’s Mobile Health segment and government vertical had been aided by a surge in COVID-19 testing and other services related to COVID-19. For example, during the pandemic, municipalities and municipal healthcare systems such as New York City and NYC Health + Hospitals engaged DocGo to provide COVID-19 testing and vaccinations for the homeless population. With the pandemic winding down in late 2022 and early 2023, DocGo sought to transition its Mobile Health division away from a COVID-19 testing-centric business to cover a wider range of population health services. One way DocGo sought to do this was by seeking government contract opportunities by responding to Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”). During the Class Period, defendants made multiple statements regarding DocGo’s RFP process and DocGo’s growing ability to pursue larger and more lucrative government contracts. For example, on January 12, 2023, Capone described “extreme acceleration” in DocGo’s RFP channel at a JPMorgan Healthcare Conference: When we look into 2023 . . . the biggest growth is probably going to come from the fact we’ve seen extreme acceleration in our RFP channel, meaning that we’re applying for more of these government awards. We’re getting better at it, and the size of the awards are getting larger and larger. They used to be in the $2 million to $10 million in annualized revenue. Now they’re in the $10 million to sometimes multi-hundred million dollars in annualized revenue that we’re applying for. On March 13, 2023, DocGo hosted an earnings call, during which the Company announced its Q4 2022 results. Then-Chief Operating Officer Lee Bienstock discussed DocGo’s pursuit of increasingly large RFP opportunities: The average size, we’ve increased significantly. We had originally started with the size that you just mentioned, around the $10 million mark, but we’ve increased that substantially to $30 million to $50 million, is our average submission at this point. So we’re going after larger opportunities, and we’re going after more opportunities. On May 8, 2023, DocGo hosted an earnings call in which it announced the Company’s Q1 2023 results. Bienstock again highlighted the growth of DocGo’s R"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Founded in 1999, Mobileye is a technology company that develops and deploys ADAS—which includes safety features such as emergency brake assistance, as well as lane-departure and blind-spot warnings—along with other autonomous driving technologies and solutions. Mobileye first went public in 2014 but was subsequently acquired by Intel Corporation in 2017. Several years later, in October 2022, Intel spun Mobileye off and Mobileye became a standalone public company again (the “IPO”). At all relevant times, Mobileye was the incumbent and dominant player in the ADAS market, repeatedly touting that it held approximately 70% of the market share in the growing ADAS market. Mobileye’s competitors also repeatedly acknowledged Mobileye as the biggest player in the ADAS market. For instance, in its SEC filings, Mobileye identifies Qualcomm and Ambarella as two of its largest competitors. Just before the start of the Class Period, Qualcomm’s CFO described Mobileye as the “incumbent clearly in ADAS.” Likewise, during the Class Period, the CEO of Ambarella readily admitted that Mobileye “really dominate[s] this market.” Based on Mobileye’s overwhelming dominance in ADAS, analysts believed that Mobileye was uniquely positioned to capture even more of the growing ADAS market and concluded that Mobileye’s ADAS market dominance justified a premium price for Mobileye stock. For instance, when they initiated coverage of the Company, analysts from Tigress Financial Partners took note of the “increasing demand for ADAS capabilities” and wrote that Mobileye’s “significant R&D investments, first-mover advantage, and industry-leading product portfolio combined with significant OEM relationships, well-position it to capitalize on a massive market opportunity.” Analysts from Cowen likewise lauded Mobileye as a “rare scaled pure-play and beneficiary of ADAS/autonomy,” stating that Mobileye’s “[s]trong growth and a wide data moat” meant that it would be difficult for competitors to steal business from Mobileye. Nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue comes from the Company’s proprietary EyeQ system-on-chip (the “EyeQ”). First launched in 2007, the EyeQ is essentially a combination of hardware and software which allows car manufacturers to implement ADAS features into their vehicles. While the EyeQ is not Mobileye’s only product, the EyeQ is “fundamental to [Mobileye’s] leadership position in ADAS,” as the Company has explained, and critical to its performance. For instance, in 2022, Mobileye sold approximately 33 million EyeQ chips, which made up 89% of its reported revenue of $1.9 billion. Almost all of the Company’s remaining revenue comes from sales of Mobileye’s SuperVision system, a more advanced autonomous driving system which itself utilizes EyeQ technology. In other words, EyeQ chips drive nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue. Mobileye primarily sells the EyeQ chip to “Tier 1” automotive suppliers, who function essentially as intermediaries between Mobileye (a “Tier 2” supplier) and car manufacturers (known as Original Equipment Manufacturers or “OEMs”), which include companies such as Ford or Volkswagen. The graphic below illustrates the relevant portion of the Mobileye and EyeQ supply chain. As Mobileye disclosed in its SEC filings, the Company relied significantly on sales to a handful of Tier 1 customers, including Aptiv PLC, Magna International, Valeo, and ZF Group. The overwhelming majority of Mobileye’s revenue comes from sales to these Tier 1 suppliers. For example, in 2023, ZF Group, Valeo, and Aptiv were Mobileye’s three biggest customers and generated nearly 70% of Mobileye’s revenue. Over decades, suppliers and manufacturers in the automotive industry have developed and implemented standards and practices to coordinate and streamline the distribution of components needed to manufacture automobiles. Among other things, these standards dictate that suppliers engage in a near-constant exchange of information, which allows each part of the supply chain to manage its inventory levels. As a May 2017 article from Automotive Logistics explained: “The typical automotive supply chain is an extended global network of suppliers, 3PLs [logistics providers], forwarders and carriers. Each company in this chain has their own systems in their silos. They work off forecasts, schedules and orders communicated by the OEM which are cascaded down to each tier of suppliers.” Tier 1 suppliers indicated that they followed industry practices with respect to supply chain management, including with regard to inventory reporting and disclosure. These supply chain management practices typically include the electronic exchange of information, including inventory levels and forecasted demand data between suppliers, in order to optimize inventory levels commensurate with manufacturing demand. Tier 1 customers typically placed orders using Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) systems, a specialized electronic industry platform that replaces paper-based documents for purchase orders or invoices and allows for instant electronic communication up and down the supply chain. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the accompanying supply chain shortages caused participants to further focus on the importance of managing inventory levels across the supply chain. For example, according to a November 2021 report issued by OpenText, an information management solutions company, the “COVID-19 pandemic exposed major vulnerabilities in widely used business models. For industries across the world, standard approaches such as just-in-time and build-to-order were found wanting. To build resilience and agility, the focus has turned to demand planning and forecasting to better match inventory to actual customer requirements.” As another example, in 2023, the Automotive Industry Action Group (“AIAG”)—an automotive trade association that, among other things, sets forth industry standards and practices to execute on the industry standards to provide regular exchange of inventory and demand information—issued a “Best Practices for Responding to Supply Chain Disruptions” guide, in which AIAG stressed the need to “establish specific parts forecast vs. firm orders [] to avoid oversupply of outdated/soon-to-be-outdated parts,” engage in “transparent communication with the suppliers,” use “EDI messaging,” and generally to “proactively communicate with suppliers on current expectations.” While there are several different processes used in supply chain management across the automotive industry, these systems all share key features, including that information concerning inventory levels and demand forecasts be exchanged frequently. As described below, Mobileye’s major customers all utilized some form of communication with other supply chain participants and/or otherwise expressly affirmed their observance of the industry standards described above, meaning that Defendants at all times received regular reports about inventory and demand from customers. ZF Group. Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customer during the Class Period, ZF Group, publicly provides a “Global Logistics Directive,” which applies to “all production materials and the associated spare parts purchased by the locations of ZF Group worldwide,” as well as “to all suppliers providing those production materials and associated spare parts to ZF.” Under this directive, ZF expressly adopts for use with suppliers different standards for communication regarding inventory and demand levels. As the Global Logistics Directive makes clear, “The overall obligation of ZF’s suppliers is to secure the delivery of ZF. This requires supplier to make a regular comparison between the MRP [material requirement planning] data from ZF and supplier’s available short-, mid- and long-term capacities . . . Supplier shall take also such additional demand data into consideration for its capacity planning.” Under each standard, described as “call-off procedures,” the supplier is given detailed information regarding ZF’s demand needs. Valeo. Another of Mobileye’s three largest Tier 1 customers, Valeo, states in its publicly available materials that it implements EDI communications to regularly report inventory and demand information to its suppliers. For example, under the publicly-available Valeo Supply Agreement Schedule that Valeo used in the ordinary course during the Class Period with its Tier suppliers (such as Mobileye), Valeo each week provides its Tier 2 suppliers with materials requirement forecasts for the following two months, at minimum. Aptiv. Another of Mobileye’s top Tier 1 customers, Aptiv, stated in its “Customer Specific Requirements” effective June 20, 2022—which applied to “Suppliers that provide direct products or materials for Aptiv,” (such as Mobileye)—that the supplier needs to be certified “as a capable and compliant EDI trading partner,” meaning, use the industry standard EDI protocol. The requirements further indicate that Aptiv provided information to suppliers as to expected production scheduling for the next 2-4 weeks, as well as information beyond four weeks “for planning purposes.” FE 1,1 an Aptiv former employee, corroborated that Aptiv used EDI with Mobileye, including specifically to provide Mobileye with both (i) 18-month forecasts, which projected demand over the long-term, and (ii) firm orders every two weeks, ensuring that Mobileye knew Aptiv’s immediate demand for the EyeQ chip throughout the Class Period. Magna. Finally, as to Magna—another of Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customers— Mobileye had in July 2014 attached to its public Form F-1 filed with the SEC a purchase schedule between the Company and Magna, which expressly stated that Magna would on a regular basis provide Mobileye with a “items identified as ‘FORECAST’ on a Purchase Schedule [that] are for planning purposes,” thus indicating Mobileye and Magna complied with industry-standard communications around inventory and demand. Magna’s insistence on these practices is further corroborated by Magna’s publicly-available “Magna Global Supply Chain Requirements” manual, dated March 30, 2017, which was “applicable to all suppliers providing materials, products and services to any Magna manufacturing facility.” That manual sets forth specific requirements that forecasting information be sent “to the suppliers through their regularly scheduled releases.” Moreover, Magna is a member of AIAG, the automotive trade association described above that sets forth industry standards, and practices to execute on those standards, to provide FE 1 worked as a Procurement Manager from August 2003 until March 2011; a Central Procurement and Customer Logistics Manager from March 2011 until May 2017; and a Production Planning and Customer Logistics Manager from May 2017 until February 2024. In each role at Aptiv, she focused on logistics, including procurement, production planning, supply chain, and customer service. FE 1 specifically said that she had direct communication with Mobileye at times, and that her group had to monitor Mobileye very closely. regular exchange of inventory and demand. This included issuing the “best practices” in 2023 that specifically advised “to avoid oversupply of outdated/soon-to-be-outdated parts” through “transparent communication with the suppliers,” the use of “EDI messaging,” and “proactively communicat[ion] with suppliers on current expectations.” In all respects, the fact that all of Mobileye’s customers regularly communicated with Mobileye regarding their inventory levels and current demand is corroborated by, among other things, Mobileye’s own statements throughout the Class Period, which touted their “continuous contact with customers.” Moreover, this is also confirmed by FE 2,2 who explained that all of Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers provided reports to Mobileye, which among other things, would update Mobileye on a change in the needs of the Tier 1 customers. These reports, FE 2 explained, were received by Mobileye’s entire commercial team. Investors That Mobileye Is Well-Positioned For Future Growth The Class Period begins on January 26, 2023, when Defendants issued a press release announcing Mobileye’s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. Mobileye announced $1.9 billion in revenue for 2022—35% year-over-year growth—driven by a significant increase in EyeQ revenue. The press release stated that Mobileye “continue[d] to execute very well in our core ADAS business” and specifically that EyeQ-related “revenue grew 48% in the [fourth] quarter due to a combination of volume and ASP growth.” Defendants attributed the Company’s success to a host of legitimate factors, including additional “Volume and ASP [average system price] growth.” Based on these revenue drivers, Defendants asserted that Mobileye had “significantly outperform[ed] underlying global auto production growth.” FE 2 worked in several roles at Mobileye since joining the Company in 2010, and was Mobileye’s Vice President of ADAS Business Development from September 2020 until the end of 2022, when she left the Company. In that role, she focused on securing business from Tier 1 customers and OEMs. During the Company’s earnings call with analysts that day, Defendant Heller again touted the Company’s 48% revenue growth from EyeQ sales, while Defendant Shashua further boasted that the Company had grown “revenue with every one of our top 10 customers in 2022” in its core EyeQ business segment. That day, Mobileye also issued impressive financial guidance for 2023, projecting revenue between approximately $2.2 and $2.3 billion, indicating more than 20% year-over-year growth. In issuing this guidance, Defendants assured the market that it was “conservative.” Discussing further during the earnings call, Defendant Heller stated that Mobileye’s guidance “assum[ed] EyeQ volume that is somewhat below the commitment that we have received from our customers for 2023. We want to remain conservative and acknowledge that the macro uncertainty remains elevated.” Defendants did not provide any further detail as to these commitments. Rather, in saying that Defendants chose to be “conservative” in their guidance by assuming growth below those “commitments,” Defendants indicated that the volumes Mobileye shipped could change based on market conditions throughout the year. Defendants also guided that revenue for the first quarter of 2023 would be lower than the just-announced fourth quarter 2022 revenue. Defendant Heller told investors that this was due to two factors: “general conservatism on the part of [Mobileye’s] customers” and higher purchases of EyeQ chips by Mobileye’s customers in late 2022 before Mobileye raised prices for the EyeQ at the start of January 2023. Defendants told investors that customers were therefore entering the Class Period with somewhat elevated levels of inventory following extra purchases during the fourth quarter of 2022, specifically because Mobileye was planning to increase prices and Mobileye’s customers wanted to take advantage before the new prices were in effect. While Defendants claimed to know why inventory levels may have been elevated, Defendants never disclosed by how much inventory had increased. In any event, Defendants assured the market that this dip in revenue growth for the first quarter of 2023 would only be temporary, and reiterated their guidance that the Company would still post 20% growth in 2023 overall, with approximately 60% of Mobileye’s 2023 revenue coming in the second half of the year. This conveyed to investors that, to the extent there were any elevated inventory levels at its customers at that time, those inventories would quickly dissipate and not impact the Company’s growth. Analysts lauded Mobileye’s strong 2022 results and positive 2023 guidance, particularly against the backdrop of the supply chain constraints in recent years. For example, analysts from J.P.Morgan raised their price target for Mobileye and declared that “Mobileye’s 4Q22 results served to alleviate investor concerns around the broader implications of a tough macro backdrop and the reverberating headwinds.” The analysts also lauded that Mobileye had “bak[ed] in conservatism even at the high end of the guidance range.” Analysts from Deutsche Bank similarly cheered Mobileye’s “better-than-expected 4Q22 operating results versus expectations across the board” and their announced 2023 guidance that had exceeded the street’s estimates. Morgan Stanley analysts who reported on Mobileye’s “Big 4Q Beat,” credited Mobileye’s 2023 projections as “a conservative guide,” and said they were “prepared to see quarterly beats along the way in 2023,” confirming the market’s understanding that volumes shipped would track market conditions. In response to Defendants’ positive representations, Mobileye’s stock price rose from a close of $33.95 on January 25, 2023 to close at $35.97 on January 26, 2023—an increase of approximately 6% in a single trading day. As the year continued, Defendants stated that the Company would continue to grow volumes and revenue in light of growing demand, even in the face of supply chain pressures. On March 9, 2023, Mobileye filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K, in which Defendants stated that, to counteract supply chain shortages, “certain Tier 1 customers [had] increased their orders for components and parts” in certain unspecified prior periods. However, while the Form 10-K suggested some “increased” sales had “shifted to earlier time periods,” “some demand . . . and corresponding revenue,” Defendants did not provide further detail. Instead, Defendants reassured investors that, in any event, they expected demand to continue to grow, stating that “ADAS volumes have grown faster in recent years than the overall automotive market as ADAS penetration rates have increased,” Mobileye was “outperforming the increase of global automotive production,” and Mobileye “believe[d] that we will continue to benefit from that trend.” In all events, Defendants further assured investors that the volume of Mobileye’s shipments to its customers would “depend upon market conditions,” and that “to mitigate [] supply chain constraints, management is monitoring inventory levels on an ongoing basis.” These representations provided assurances to investors that Mobileye’s sales related to actual market demand, and therefore further assured investors as to the quality and nature of its present revenue as well as the sustainability of Mobileye’s growth, which was critical to the market’s valuation of the Company. Inventory and volumes were of particular interest to analysts, who asked questions about the issues throughout the Class Period, and in response Defendants spoke frequently on the subjects. For instance, Mobileye held its earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 on April 27, During that call, Defendant Heller told analysts that “based on the latest indications from Tier 1[s],” Mobileye had “seen some movements of volumes out of Q2 and into the second half of the year”—in other words, certain customers postponed orders of EyeQ chips until the second half of 2023. An analyst from Goldman Sachs asked Defendants to “elaborate a little bit more on what might be happening there.” In response, Defendant Heller indicated that Defendants analyzed shipments relative to demand, noting that the decision by the Tier 1 customers was “probably something to do about their inventory levels and considerations versus demand,” based on “the information that” Mobileye had, but assured this analyst that the amount of volume that Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers had moved to the second half of 2023 was “not very significant.” Defendant Shashua jumped in and further assured investors that “we are in a very good discussions and trying to balance their commitment from quarter to quarter rather than lumping it into one or two quarters towards the end of the year. And we managed quite successfully to reach a point in which the change in second quarter is really minimal.” Defendants’ assurances about Mobileye’s continued growth and focus on balancing supply to its customers encouraged the market. Analysts from Barclays wrote that “the growth opportunity is very much intact.” Likewise, analysts from Cowen noted that the “[o]verall thesis and Mobileye’s content/vehicle expansion [was] firmly intact.” On July 27, 2023, Mobileye announced financial results for the second quarter of The Company again assured investors that Mobileye was “positioned well for the increased revenue"

During the Class Period, the Company’s common stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “AAL.” Defendant Robert D. Isom, Jr. (“Isom”) was, at all relevant times, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and a member of American’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Defendant Devon E. May (“May”) was, at all relevant times, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Defendant Vasu S. Raja (“Raja”) was the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer (“CCO”) between April 2022 and May 28, 2024. Prior to these roles, Raja served as Senior Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer between June 2020 and April 2022, and as Senior Vice President of Network Strategy between October 2019 and June 2020. On May 28, 2024, American issued a press release announcing, inter alia, that Raja’s responsibilities would be immediately assumed by Stephen Johnson, Vice Chair of American’s Board of Directors and Chief Strategy Officer, and that Raja would be leaving the Company in June 2024. Defendants Isom, May, and Raja are referred to herein collectively as the “Individual Defendants.” The Company and the Individual Defendants are collectively referred to herein as “Defendants.” The Individual Defendants, by virtue of their high-level positions at American, directly participated in the management of American and were directly involved in the day-to-day operations of American at their highest levels. As such, they were privy to confidential, proprietary information concerning the Company and its business operations, growth, and financial condition. As set forth below, the materially misstated information conveyed to the public was the result of the collective actions of these individuals. As senior executives at a publicly-held company with securities registered with the SEC and traded on the Nasdaq, the Individual Defendants each had a duty to disseminate prompt, accurate, and truthful information with respect to the Company’s business, operations, financial statements, and internal controls, and to correct any previously issued statements that were or had become materially misleading or untrue, so that the market price of American’s publicly traded securities would be based on accurate information. Each Individual Defendant violated these requirements and obligations during the Class Period. As a result of their positions of control and authority as senior executives, the Individual Defendants were able to and did control the content of the public statements issued by the Company during the Class Period. Each Individual Defendant had the ability to correct the statements or prevent them from being released into the public sphere. Accordingly, the Individual Defendants are responsible for the accuracy of the materially false and misleading public statements detailed in this Complaint. Further, as a result of their positions of control and authority as senior executives, the Individual Defendants had access to adverse, undisclosed information about the Company’s business, operations, financial statements, and internal controls through their access to internal corporate documents and conversations with other corporate officers and employees. The Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that these adverse undisclosed facts rendered the positive representations made by or about the Company materially false and misleading. CW1 was employed at American from 2019 to January 2024. In CW1’s last six months at American, CW1’s position was Travel Agency Account Manager. During this time, CW1 was based out of one of American’s hub cities, and managed accounts for two “very large” corporate travel agencies. CW2 was an American employee for over three decades until leaving the Company on January 31, 2024. During the Class Period, CW2 worked as a Retail Business Manager within American’s Global Sales division managing small, medium, and large-sized travel agency accounts located in the Midwestern and Southern Region of the United States. CW2 reported to Director of Airline Retailing for the United States and Canada, Jerome Riese, who reported to Director of Airline Retailing, Jay Creech. Creech, in turn, reported to Neil Geurin, Managing Director of Airline Retailing, who reported to Scott Laurence, who reported directly to Defendant Raja. CW2 also interacted with Scott Laurence, explaining that while Sales and Partnerships were distinct organizations within American, Laurence was responsible for both, and Raja used Laurence as a “mouthpiece” to issue directives. As a Retail Business Manager, CW2’s daily responsibilities included contacting travel agencies in CW2’s region to address service issues, including assisting with travelers’ needs, meeting with agencies to ensure that they were meeting goals that American set for them and to discuss ways to increase American’s share of business with those agencies, and providing training and presentations to agencies. CW2 also participated in bi-weekly and quarterly reviews with higher-ups, including Geurin, to discuss the performance of CW2’s accounts. IV. SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS Multiple Distribution Channels Through its subsidiaries, American operates as a major network air carrier providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo. American treats all of the flight equipment operated through its principal subsidiary, regional airline subsidiaries, and third-party regional carriers as one fleet, which the Company deploys through a single route scheduling system. American also manages its operations under a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo. American generates the vast majority of its revenue from passenger travel. For instance, in its financial and operational report for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 on Form 10-K (the “FY2023 Form 10-K”), American reported total operating revenues of $52.8 billion in 2023, of which $48.5 billion corresponded to passenger revenues (i.e., almost 92%). American’s passenger travel business includes sales relating to airfare and ancillary services, such as seat upgrades, checked baggage, Wi-Fi access, and premium dining. American’s “direct” sales channels include the Company’s website, mobile app, American Airlines reservations, American Airlines Vacations, and American Airlines Ticket Centers. Through American’s direct channels, which are mostly, if not fully, controlled by the Company, travelers are direct customers of the airline. The Company also sells airfare and ancillary services through third-party distribution channels, including travel agencies, specialized agencies called travel management companies (“TMCs”), metasearch engines or aggregator services (e.g., Google Flights and Kayak), and online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Booking Holdings. When American fares or services are sold to travelers through third-party distribution channels, such travelers are considered the mutual customers of both American and the third-party distributor. TMCs are agencies that primarily cater to business and corporate travelers. At all relevant times, there were five large TMCs that dominated the corporate travel planning industry for large companies—American Express Global Business Travel (“AmEx GBT”), BCD Group N.V., CWT (formerly Carlson Wagonlit Travel), FCM Travel, and Corporate Travel Management Ltd.—as well as various small-to-mid-sized TMCs, such as Anthony Travel. GDSs, such as Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport, operate as the intermediary between third party distributors (i.e., TMCs and agencies) and airlines. GDSs are centralized platforms for viewing airline schedules, booking airline seats, issuing airline tickets, and providing other travel-related services. Airlines pay GDSs per transaction as compensation for listing their fares within the GDSs’ software, with fees typically ranging between two and four percent of a ticket price (i.e., an average of $4 to $6 per booking). Third party distributors use the GDSs’ software to offer and sell airfares and ancillary services to travelers. Approximately $14 billion of the $48.5 billion of revenue that corresponded to passenger revenues in 2023 (roughly 29%) was booked through “the distribution channel traditionally used by travel agencies and corporate managed travel programs” (i.e., EDIFACT). American’s Passenger Travel Consists of Leisure, Business, and Blended Travel American’s passenger travel customers include individuals who are flying for leisure, business, and “blended” (both leisure and business) purposes. Business and blended travel are most commonly booked as “managed travel,” wherein a business traveler’s employer either has an in-house corporate travel department and/or contracts with a TMC to book and manage travel for the employees. Many employers, especially corporations, prefer to manage travel for their employees because the structure ensures adherence to the employer’s travel policies and provides duty-of-care protections for traveling employees. By contrast, with “unmanaged travel,” a company’s employees are free to make their own travel arrangements, including choosing their preferred carriers, hotels, and car rental agencies, without the use of a third party to facilitate bookings. At the beginning of the Class Period, during the Company’s earnings call for the second quarter of 2023 (“2Q 2023 Earnings Call”) on July 20, 2023, Defendant Raja described the breakdown of American’s passenger flights as: “a mix of 35% leisure style travel, 35% blended style travel, 30% [business].” A portion of American’s fares are sold via “close-in bookings,” which consist of flight reservations made within a relatively short time frame before the flight’s departure, typically within 21 days. Many close-in bookings are made for business travelers, whose employers are more willing to pay for premium fares or services. While the Company does not report the portion of its revenues derived from close-in bookings, Defendant Isom confirmed on May 29, 2024 that close-in bookings represented some of the “highest premium customers” that American serviced. American’s AAdvantage Program Rewards Customers Through Travel Perks American’s AAdvantage frequent flier loyalty program is one of the world’s largest loyalty programs with over 100 million members. With the Company’s AAdvantage program, members who fly on American, any oneworld Alliance airline, any of American’s other airline partners, or who use an American co-branded credit card can earn AAdvantage “miles” and/or “loyalty points.” Through American’s AAdvantage program, one eligible AAdvantage mile earns the member one loyalty point. While AAdvantage members can redeem AAdvantage miles for flights, upgrades, car rentals, hotel stays, and travel experiences, AAdvantage loyalty points afford members a certain status level, such as Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro, and Executive Platinum. Each status level provides certain benefits and perks like complimentary upgrades, free checked bags, and priority boarding, as well as additional bonus mileage credits depending on status level. American Historically Contracted with Travel Agencies, TMCs, and Corporations to Offer Incentives and Benefits For Booking on American Historically, before a United States travel agency could sell and issue American airfare and ancillary services to businesses, the agency was required to enter into two agreements: (1) the Agent Reporting Agreement with Airlines Reporting Corporation (“ARC”), a company which enables travel agencies to consolidate the management of their relationships with global air travel suppliers and gives them the ability to issue tickets on flights worldwide; and (2) the American Airlines Addendum to the Governing Travel Agency Agreements for ARC Accredited Agents and their affiliates (the “American Addendum”) (collectively with the ARC Agent Reporting Agreement, the “Governing Travel Agency Agreements”). The American Addendum enumerated the Company’s policies for issuing commissions (if any) and certain incentives to travel agencies. American also offered incentives through contracts with consumer travel agencies. For instance, in its “Basic Economy Upsell Program” agreement with Expedia, American agreed to pay Expedia incentive fees for “Upsell Tickets” (i.e., when optional services and upgrades are added to the ticket). Similarly, in American’s “Premium Performance Payment” agreement with Expedia, the Company agreed to pay Expedia a certain amount for meeting certain growth percentage thresholds in its sale of premium tickets. Travel agencies also receive incentives from GDS providers, including volume awards that incentivize bookings through their systems. Prior to the Class Period, American similarly entered into contracts with corporate customers to incentivize the corporations to book with American through third party distribution channels. In these contracts, American historically offered, inter alia, automatic upgrades to AAdvantage status levels, discounted fares and preferred seats, priority boarding, dedicated account managers, and access to the Company’s SalesLink Insights and SalesLink Services. SalesLink Insights is an online tool that provides agencies, TMCs, and corporations with the ability to view their progress in meeting contract performance terms such as spending and revenue share, and data relating to ancillary services, savings, and “Flex Funds,” a service giving third parties access and management over fee waivers. SalesLink Services is a self-service online portal that American customers can use to make certain service requests, such as changing unacceptable itineraries or correcting customer names on tickets, and to access real-time reporting for such requests. CW2 confirmed that with SalesLink Insights, third parties can see only data pertaining to their own bookings and services, but American can see data for all third parties that it contracts with, such as all agencies. Defendant Raja stated on July 20, 2023, that at the peak of the Company’s corporate contracting prior to its decided shift towards NDC in 2023, up to 35% of all AAdvantage members with elevated status levels had such statuses due to upgrades given in corporate contracts, rather than through actually flying and accumulating AAdvantage loyalty points. Industry Relied on to Exchange Booking Data Between Travel Providers and Travel Purchasers Traditionally, the travel industry used EDIFACT channels for the third party distribution of airfare. EDIFACT is a global standard for electronic data sharing that the airline and travel industries have utilized since the 1980s to exchange information between airlines, travel agents, and businesses. EDIFACT only allows airlines to share a small portion of information about airfare and related services. Many modern airline services such as seat upgrades, extra baggage, extra leg room, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi, à la carte menu options, and insurance cannot be merchandised through EDIFACT channels. EDIFACT is heavily reliant on GDSs to take real-time availability from airlines along with the airlines’ filed fares and build itineraries using market prices. The GDSs then present that information to the third party distributors (i.e., TMCs and travel agencies) who order the tickets in the GDS and inform the airlines of the transactions. In 2012, the global airline industry trade association IATA developed NDC to transform how airlines distribute and sell flight content. NDC allows airlines to market their fares and services with photos and detailed descriptions of their services, to continuously adjust their pricing, provide personalized offers and bundles, and offer ancillary services like seat upgrades, in-flight meals, Wi-Fi, etc. NDC also establishes a direct data connection for information to flow between a traveling customer and the airline, which allows airlines to more directly communicate with travelers and bypass GDS providers, meaning airlines avoid paying extra fees while taking greater control over their products as compared to distribution through EDIFACT channels. As such, NDC represents an opportunity for carriers to make more money, through continuous pricing and offering a wider array of ancillary services, and to lower costs by reducing distribution fees charged by the GDSs. NDC is not a universal system, as each airline builds its own application programming interface (“API”) through various IT providers and technology partners. Therefore, to access this information, travel agencies and businesses can book travel using NDC through either a direct connection, such as an airline’s website or NDC API, or through an indirect channel, whereby third-party intermediaries, like GDSs and content aggregator companies such as Travelfusion, TPConnects, or ARC Direct Connect, connect to an airline’s NDC APIs to access and display airline offers, fares, and ancillary services to travelers. Thus, for a business to be NDC-compatible requires committing the time and investments necessary to enable NDC functionality in an industry where many consumers are accustomed to buying tickets through intermediaries rather than buying directly from airlines. Access to Forty Percent of Its Booking Content CW2 explained that starting in late 2022 and continuing past the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January 2024, American made a series of changes to its distribution strategy in order to push companies and travel agencies to use American’s NDC channels to book directly with American. Moreover, as CW2 later learned from a meeting with Neil Geurin and Jay Creech in October of 2023, Defendant Raja wanted to drive NDC adoption so that American could eventually eliminate third parties, like agencies, entirely from the distribution process. CW2 recalled hearing that Raja felt it was unfair to the Company to have a third party booking American’s flights, and that instead, Raja felt that American should be able to manage its own bookings. As a part of this push, on December 5, 2022, American Airlines sent memoranda to travel agencies, TMCs, and corporate customers notifying them that they would need to be connected to American’s NDC technology by April 2023 to ensure access to the Company’s full range of third-party public channel content. If travel agencies, TMCs, and corporate customers chose not to connect through American’s NDC channels, then American estimated that the third parties and corporate customers would lose access to over 40% of fares available to them via EDIFACT channels, including American’s lowest-priced “basic economy” fares, as well as some ancillary products. American’s decision to make basic economy fares accessible only through NDC channels was significant because it also hampered the Company’s ability to attract price-conscious travelers to compete with so-called ultra low-cost carriers, like Frontier, Spirit, and Allegiant. Indeed, when American first introduced basic economy fares in 2017, Defendant Isom explained that the Company was offering these entry-level price points to “help us compete more effectively with the growing number of ultra-low-cost carriers.” CW2 confirmed that unless a customer used NDC channels, they would not be able to purchase American’s basic economy rates, the lowest-priced fares that American offers. CW2 confirmed that these changes were directed by Defendant Raja. A March 2023 American and Hickory Global Partners joint presentation, titled “Modern Retailing with American Airlines” (“2023 Modern Retailing Presentation”) also confirmed that more than 40% of the fares available via EDIFACT channels would become exclusively available via NDC channels. The 2023 Modern Retailing Presentation noted that American was no longer making its lowest priced fares available through EDIFACT channels and was instead only offering “Everyday Main and Premium cabin fares” through that legacy channel. American also exclusively offered its Main Plus, Main Select, and Flagship Business Plus fares through NDC enabled channels and American-owned channels.3 As a result of these changes, in order to purchase American’s exclusive NDC content, travel agencies and corporate customers would either have to book with American directly or connect to “[t]hird-party modern retailing (NDC-enabled channels)” (i.e., travel agencies and booking tools connected to American’s NDC). According to CW2, American’s NDC-based modern distribution channel, as it pertained to travel agencies, was referred to within the Company as its “Direct Connect” platform because travel agencies and corporations were supposed to use it to book directly with American, rather than rely more heavily on traditional, third-party GDSs and EDIFACT technology to facilitate bookings. American aggressively pushed NDC because doing so allowed the Company to increase their margins by selling more products and services while also reducing the Company’s distribution costs. American also sought"

      "summary": "Concho was an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is a large sedimentary basin in located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico covering more than 86,000 square miles and extending across an area approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long. The Permian Basin one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States and is characterized by an extensive production history, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, and enhanced recovery potential. The greater Permian Basin comprises several component basins, including the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin, which are further subdivided by formation such as Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Avalon Shale, and Spraberry. As of December 31, 2017, approximately: (i) 35 percent of Concho’s proved reserves were attributable to the Northern Delaware Basin core area that primarily targets the Avalon shale and Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations; (ii) 15 percent of Concho’s proved reserves were attributable to the Southern Delaware Basin core area that primarily targets the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations; (iii) 32 percent of the Company’s proved reserves were attributable to the Midland Basin core area that primarily targets the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations; and (iv) 18 percent of Concho’s proved reserves were attributable to the New Mexico Shelf core area that primarily targets the Yeso formation. At all relevant times, one of the pillars of Concho’s business model was its purported commitment to “capital discipline.” Specifically, that Concho moderated its operations in order to generate and grow free cash flow, which was then used to fund future operations. To maintain this level of capital discipline, the Company needed balance the cost of its drilling and completion operations with current and projected oil and natural gas production and related revenues. In the event the Company’s development projects failed to deliver expected production rates, thereby negatively impacting free cash flow, Concho would be forced to reduce drilling activity to avoid off-shooting budgets. In turn, a reduction in active drilling would impair future financial performance and growth. Thus, should one or more of the Company’s major development projects fail, it could provoke a domino effect adversely impacting Concho’s production and growth for the foreseeable future. Prior to the start of the Class Period, Concho primarily produced oil and natural gas through established methodologies that involved minimal risk. Leading up to and throughout the Class Period, however, Concho transitioned its production focus to large-scale development projects in the Permian Basin—frequently touting with much fanfare to the investing public that it was utilizing “manufacturing style development” and had entered “manufacturing mode.” According to the Company, this transition was an “inflection point” that allowed the Company to increase production and recovery rates at a lower capital cost while mitigating risk. These manufacturing style projects entailed the active development of Concho’s resource base by combining multiple advanced and often unverified completion methodologies (either individually or as combined) such as cube drilling, zipper fracturing, tight well-spacing and other advanced completion methodologies throughout its four core operating areas in the Permian Basin. As part of Concho’s strategic shift to “manufacturing mode,” the Company designed in 2017-2018 the flagship Dominator multi-well pad to be constructed in the Wolfcamp Shale formation of the Northern Delaware Basin, which began construction in 2018. As planned, the Dominator was a 23 multi-well pad with an average well spacing of 230 feet and average lateral length of 4,500 feet targeting five distinct landing zones within a single section utilizing seven completion crews, and therefore incredibly large in scope. Oil and natural gas reserves are defined as those resources which are anticipated to be commercially recovered from known accumulations. Drilling and exploration companies such as Concho classify their oil and natural gas reserves based on the probability of commercially viable recovery, which is measured in barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”), millions of Boe (“MMBoe”), and/or thousands of Boe per day (“MBoepd”). These classifications, as discussed below, are essential in determining the fair market value (“FMV”) of a company’s assets, i.e., the price that an item would sell for on the open market, as they determine the risk-adjusted rates of return for the reserves. Further, these risk-adjusted rates of return are vital for companies like Concho for planning and accounting purposes, such as setting capital budgets and issuing financial and production forecasts. On the other hand, should assets be miscategorized, a company could significantly overstate the FMV of its resources as well as their forecasted production. “Proved Reserves,” which are broken up into three categories, are those reserves that are estimated commercially recoverable with a 90% level of certainty, and therefore carry the lowest level of risk. Proved Reserves are integral to the valuation of companies like Concho, as the ability of the Company to generate future revenue significantly depends upon how much of its discovered resources can be reliably extracted. Publicly traded oil and natural gas companies are required to include Proved Reserves in their financial reporting to help investors and analysts model future returns. “Proved Developed Producing” (PDP) reserves are those for which the well is completed, and the reserves are currently being produced. “Proved Developed Non-Producing” (PDNP) reserves are those for which the well-bore exists, and the reserves are identified but are not currently producing for some reason. “Proved Undeveloped” (PUD) reserves are those determined to be economically recoverable utilizing existing technology and assets, but where the well has not yet been completed. PUD represents the lowest risk adjustment for uncompleted oil and natural gas projects. If a reserve’s resources are technically recoverable using current technology yet lack the requisite level of certainty that such recovery would be commercially viable, it cannot be considered a Proved Reserve. In that case, the reserve may be categorized as “Probable” or “Possible.” Probable reserves are those with a likelihood of commercial extraction of over 50% but under 90%, while Possible reserves are those with odds of commercial extraction under 50%, but higher than 10%. Aside from Proved Reserves, Probable, and Possible reserves, resources may also be categorized as “Contingent.” Contingent resources are those estimated to be potentially recoverable, but which are not considered to be commercially recoverable with any reasonable degree of certainty due to any number of contingencies, including whether recovery is dependent on the development and/or testing of new technology. Oil and natural gas resources classified as Contingent are inherently high risk. Traditionally, oil and natural gas wells were drilled vertically in order to access an underground reserve of oil or natural gas. With the advent of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” however, lateral or horizontal oil and natural gas wells slowly overtook vertical wells as the predominant resource recovery methodology in the United States. Hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique used commonly in low- permeability rocks like tight sandstone/limestone, shale, and some coal beds to increase oil and/or gas flow to a well from petroleum-bearing rock formations. The process involves the high- pressure injection of “fracking fluid” (a slurry consisting primarily of water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents and other chemicals) into a wellbore to create cracks (or flow pathways) in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas and petroleum will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants hold the fractures open so that hydrocarbons can flow from the producing formation to the wellbore and ultimately produced and captured at the surface. While longer lateral well length can result in increased production and efficiencies by providing greater exposure to the formation of interest, they can carry considerable drawbacks, such as high levels of operational risks throughout the life cycle of the well. Such risks, which become more likely as lateral length increases, include costly and time-consuming remedial measures to salvage jammed equipment or to remedy sudden changes in the well’s direction. Further, these and other risks, if critical, may permanently impair the well’s productivity. These risk factors are crucial to the considerations involved in determining the optimal lateral length in particular reservoirs and areas. Beginning at the turn of the century, a drilling technique known as “pad drilling” ballooned in popularity for onshore drilling and completions. Essentially, pad drilling is the practice of drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single surface (or “pad”) location. Prior to the development of pad drilling, an operator would drill a single well, disassemble the drilling rig, move it to a new location, and then repeat the process. Pad drilling, however, allows multiple wells to be drilled from a single drilling pad location. When working correctly, multi-well pad drilling reduces drilling cycle time and overall operational cost, while leaving a smaller footprint on the surface (i.e., less surface disturbances). Well spacing considerations, both vertical and horizontal, are of paramount importance for multi-well drilling. In general, more tightly spaced wells—both vertical or horizontal—can lead to fracture interference which can in turn lead to the permanent degradation of a well’s productivity over time. Hydraulic fracturing involves breaking rock to create a complex fracture network thousands of feet below land surface that cannot be fully controlled. Extremely high pressures are used to create the fracture network, but the exact direction and extent of fractures depends largely on the rock itself. Geological heterogeneities and changes encountered by or brought on by existing hydraulic fractures can cause new fractures to inadvertently trend in the unintended directions or pathways, thereby permanently reducing recovery potential. As wells are spaced more closely, the risk of wells interfering with one another is amplified. Spacing risk due to fracture interference is frequently discussed in the context of, but not limited to, parent-child interference. In that instance, a child or infill well is drilled in proximity to an existing or parent well (often which has been producing for some time) in order to capture remaining resources in the formation. Parent-child interference due to close spacing occurs when the existing well/fractures results in lower geological pressure, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the child well. Further, in many cases the parent well may also be negatively impacted by tightly spaced infill drilling and well completions. Following the rise of onshore pad multi-well drilling, in the past decade, a simultaneous well completion method known as “zipper fracturing” has been increasingly utilized, in part, as a measure to avoid or minimize parent-child interference. Instead of drilling and hydraulically fracturing one well at a time, the zipper method involves drilling multiple wells from a multi-well pad site and then hydraulically fracturing a stage in one well, while at the same time preparing to fracture a parallel well immediately following the first, and so on. The multi- well completion method earns its name from the zipper-like configuration of the fracture stages between multiple wells. When working as intended, zipper fracturing can drastically decrease time to completion for multiple wells while increasing efficiency and yield. However, zipper fracturing carries its own operational risk on top of the risks associated with lateral wells and multi-well pad drilling. For example, while purportedly offering economies of scale, due to the simultaneous nature of zipper fracturing it is highly resource intensive during drilling operations and therefore highly sensitive to interruption. Further, absent correct fracture modeling and execution, including variables such as spacing considerations and the management of pressure between wells, zipper fracturing can still introduce adverse interference between multiple fractures due to tightly spaced wells, ultimately leading to permanently lower than anticipated resource recovery. Thus, while zipper fracturing can serve to reduce parent-child interference, it is by no means immune to fracture interference brought on by tightly spaced wells. In recent years, an unproven technique known as “cube drilling” has gained interest in multi-well pad drilling operations. Cube drilling applies zipper fracturing using a three-dimensional, multi-layer approach. On paper, cube drilling can greatly increase the rate of resource recovery, although it is undecided whether cube drilling can also increase maximum recovery over time as well. The upfront costs of cube drilling are in the hundreds of millions of dollars and therefore astronomically prohibitive. Drilling and completing a large number of wells at once greatly reduces the ability to test spacing while also exponentially increasing the complexity and sophistication of the well site. One misstep in the planning, fracture modeling, construction, and execution of a cube drilling operation can result in a cascading failure which permanently impairs recovery for the entire pad—causing the upfront investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to evaporate. Accordingly, cube drilling likely introduces the largest amount of risk in drilling and completing wells in the entire upstream energy industry. Moreover, combining an unproven technology such as cube drilling, which carries a significant amount of inherent risk, with other risky techniques such as tightly spaced vertical wells and tightly spaced horizontal, or downspaced, wells, further intensifies the overall risk profile of the project. Further, these risks are not merely additive of one another but are instead compounding. While some level of risk and the management thereof is a characteristic of the oil and gas industry, combining multiple unproven, unreversible, extremely costly, and/or high-risk activities—i.e., cube drilling, zipper fracturing, tightly spaced vertical and horizonal wells, and long lateral length—carries an enormous risk that far surpasses the typical level of risk for oil and gas development projects.",
