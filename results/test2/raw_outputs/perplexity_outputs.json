      "summary": "Lead Plaintiffs United Association National Pension Fund (UANPF) and Saskatchewan Healthcare Employees’ Pension Plan (SHEPP) bring this securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of Carvana Co. ('Carvana') Class A common stock during the Class Period from May 6, 2020, to November 3, 2022, alleging a 'pump-and-dump' scheme by Defendants. Defendants include Carvana; Ernest Garcia III ('Garcia Junior,' CEO, President, and Chairman); Mark Jenkins (CFO); Ernest Garcia II ('Garcia Senior,' controlling shareholder); Ryan Keeton (Chief Brand Officer); and Benjamin Huston (COO) (collectively, 'Exchange Act Defendants'). The complaint alleges Defendants artificially inflated Carvana's stock price through misrepresentations and omissions about the Company's unsustainable retail sales growth, which was achieved via unsustainable practices including: (i) lowering vehicle purchasing and verification standards to buy low-quality cars 'as much as was humanly possible,' leading to excess wholesale inventory and logistical constraints; (ii) rapid expansion into over 150 new markets far from inspection/reconditioning centers ('IRCs'), straining the purportedly 'capital-light' model and logistics network; (iii) violating state title and registration laws by selling cars without title and issuing illegal out-of-state temporary tags; and (iv) pass-through sales with Garcia Senior's DriveTime to inflate reported units. Defendants touted Carvana as the 'Amazon of used cars' with scalable growth, efficient logistics, and improving profitability metrics like Total Gross Profit Per Unit ('Total GPU'), while concealing mounting costs, unprofitability, and regulatory risks. Supported by 11 confidential witnesses (former employees detailing poor vehicle quality, title issues, logistics chaos, and growth-at-all-costs directives), SEC filings, earnings calls, and media reports, the scheme enabled Defendants to sell $3.87 billion in stock (Garcia Senior alone: $3.6 billion) at peaks up to $376/share before partial disclosures caused a 97%+ drop to $7.39/share. Claims include: Exchange Act violations (§10(b)/Rule 10b-5, §20(a), §20(A)); and Securities Act claims (§11, §12(a)(2), §15) for the April 2022 Public Offering subclass by purchasers therein. Significant dates: Class Period start May 6, 2020 (Q1 2020 earnings); end November 3, 2022 (Q3 2022 earnings revealing sales decline); key partial disclosures include NC license suspension (Aug. 2021), WSJ scrutiny article (Oct. 2021), Q1 2022 miss/ADESA acquisition (Apr. 2022), layoffs (May 2022), Barron's exposé (Jun. 2022), MI license suspension (Oct. 2022).",

Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005)). The complaint satisfies each element. **Material Misrepresentation/Omission**: Detailed allegations identify specific statements in SEC filings, earnings calls, and shareholder letters (e.g., ¶¶200-229, 238-267, 268-285) touting sustainable growth, scalable logistics, capital-light expansion, profitable customer-sourced inventory, and Total GPU improvements, while omitting that growth relied on unsustainable practices (lowered standards yielding trash vehicles/wholesale losses, distant-market expansion spiking logistics costs >$750/unit over 200 miles from IRCs, illegal title/registration violations causing fines/suspensions). CW accounts (11 former employees) corroborate pervasiveness (e.g., CW-1: buying bullet-hole cars; CW-3: title 'fire' post-May 2020; CW-4: title spreadsheets, ADESA for logistics/title fix). Omissions were material as they misled on core metrics (retail units, GPU) and risks, inflating stock to $376 (¶11). **Scienter**: Strong inference via core operations doctrine (Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 324 (2007)); Defendants' hands-on roles (Huston oversaw inventory/logistics; Garcia Junior/Jenkins certified filings); CW reports of direct knowledge (CW-5/11: C-suite calls on quality/title issues); massive suspicious insider sales ($3.87B, Garcia Senior $3.6B, timed pre-disclosures, modified 10b5-1 plans); scheme motive (pump for dumps); core confidentiality (metrics tracked in Tableau showing declining GPU/days-to-sale); SARBOX certifications. Holistic view favors scienter over nonculpable inferences. **Connection/Reliance/Loss**: Fraud-on-market (Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988)) presumed in efficient NYSE market; Class Period purchases. **Economic Loss/Loss Causation**: 97%+ drop ($376 to $7.39) tied to partial disclosures revealing truth (e.g., NC/MI suspensions, Q1 2022 miss/ADESA $4B debt, Barron's exposé, Q3 sales decline), negating inflation (Dura)."

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Glen Littleton brings this consolidated class action on behalf of all individuals and entities who purchased or sold Tesla securities (stock and options) during the Class Period of August 7, 2018 to August 17, 2018, and were damaged thereby. Defendants are Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk (CEO and former Chairman), and Tesla's Board of Directors (Brad W. Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio J. Gracias, James Murdoch, Kimbal Musk, and Linda Johnson Rice). The complaint alleges that Musk made false and misleading statements via Twitter, emails, and Tesla blog posts about considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share, claiming 'funding secured' and 'investor support confirmed,' with the only contingency being a shareholder vote. These statements created the false impression that a going-private transaction was virtually certain, when in reality no funding was secured, no key terms (including price) were discussed or agreed with potential investors like Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, no advisors were retained, no board proposal was finalized, and numerous contingencies remained unresolved. Musk knew of the uncertainties (e.g., only 50% likelihood, Middle East factory condition was a 'non-starter') but tweeted impulsively to over 22 million followers, motivated by animosity toward short sellers and to inflate stock price to benefit convertible bond conversions. Tesla is liable because it designated Musk's Twitter as an official disclosure channel without adequate controls. The Board is liable as controlling persons. The statements caused Tesla stock to surge 11% on August 7 (damaging shorts who covered at inflated prices), then decline ~9% on August 17 after NYT revelations, harming buyers and options traders via artificial inflation and volatility. Legal claims: Count I - Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against Tesla and Musk; Count II - Section 20(a) against the Board. Significant dates: Musk's initial tweet August 7, 2018; NYT corrective disclosure August 17, 2018; SEC settlements September/October 2018.",

Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005); PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)). The complaint satisfies each element. Material misrepresentations/omissions are pled with particularity, specifying Musk's August 7 tweets ('Funding secured,' 'Investor support confirmed; only reason not certain is shareholder vote'), blog posts, and emails falsely implying deal imminence despite no secured funding, no price discussions, no advisors retained, 'unprecedented' structure, and known contingencies (e.g., PIF's Middle East factory demand, Musk's own 50% success estimate). These were material as evidenced by 11% stock surge, analyst reports (RBC, Morningstar), high volume (30M+ shares), and volatility spike. Scienter is strongly inferred via Musk's admissions (statements 'premised on baseless assumptions contrary to facts he knew'), SEC consent judgment (neither admitting nor denying but not contesting fraud allegations per 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(e)), motive (hurt shorts, evidenced by prior tweets/promises of 'short burn,' stock buys; bond conversion benefits), recklessness (impulsive tweeting without review, ignoring reporter's legal warning), and core operations knowledge as CEO. Tesla's scienter is imputed via respondeat superior as Musk acted with apparent authority on designated disclosure channel (2013 8-K). Efficient market reliance presumed (Cammer factors satisfied: NASDAQ-listed, high volume/analyst coverage). Loss causation shown by stock decline tracing to partial corrective disclosures (e.g., WSJ/SEC probe Aug 8-9 drops; NYT Aug 17 9% drop revealing no funding/commitment), harming both buyers (inflation) and shorts/options traders. PSLRA safe harbor inapplicable (mixed present/past facts, not pure forward-looking with meaningful cautions). Motion denied."

Board members' general oversight duties and high-level positions (e.g., Denholm chair post-period) insufficient absent specific allegations of awareness/control over Musk's impulsive tweets before posting (Iqbal/Twombly plausibility). Tesla's 2013 8-K designating Musk's Twitter imposed monitoring duty, but complaint alleges no pre-tweet Board knowledge/review (Musk tweeted en route to airport without notice; IR queried post-facto). Post-tweet actions (Aug 8 press release, special committee, reining in Musk's tweets via Gracias) show response, not culpable causation. No specific facts tying individual directors (e.g., Buss, Ehrenpreis) to misleading statements or failure to correct pre-damages. PSLRA requires particularized facts of control exercised 'in connection with the primary violation'; generalized 'duty-bound to oversee' allegations plead no more than negligence.

Here, statements attributing subscriber weakness to COVID pull-forward (e.g., ¶¶76, 88, 96, 107, 109, 137, 148, 162) are non-actionable opinions or forward-looking statements with historical context, protected by PSLRA safe harbor if accompanied by meaningful cautionary language (e.g., 2020/2021 10-Ks warned of multi-household usage risks; ¶¶82, 135, 170). Penetration statements (e.g., Neumann's '60% UCAN' ¶131, 172) are inconsistent with later admissions but puffery or reasonable estimates based on paying subscribers; effective penetration calculations (¶¶192-197) are Plaintiff's approximations, not proven falsity, and Netflix disclosed monitoring/sharing (¶¶64, 82). No material omissions of then-present facts; account sharing was long-known/publicly discussed pre-Class Period (¶¶4-5, 55, 62-66), with warnings in filings. Scienter fails: Former employee allegations (¶¶32-35, 67-68, 189-191) are vague, lack specifics on Individual Defendants' knowledge/timing, and contradict pandemic memo halting crackdowns (¶67); core operations inference weak as growth was Plaintiff's key metric but sharing not disclosed as material inhibitor until post-period (¶116). No confidential witness statements tying executives to contrary data during Class Period; motive (avoiding stock drops) insufficient. Reliance/economic loss presumed via fraud-on-market but loss causation absent—stock drops tied to guidance misses, not sharing disclosures (Jan. 2022 drop pre-sharing admission; ¶176), and analysts attributed to multiple factors (¶125).

Key factual allegations, supported by detailed accounts from five former employees (FEs), include: (1) Talis's January 2021 FDA EUA submission used an insufficiently sensitive comparator assay, dooming it from inception (FDA rejected it days after IPO, undisclosed until March 8, 2021); (2) the Talis One had known design flaws (e.g., leaking cartridges, small chambers) and high invalid rates (>10%) pre-IPO, rendering it non-functional; (3) manufacturing was severely delayed, with no realistic path to scale (e.g., false claims of ordering '5,000 instruments' vs. mere components, inability to produce 1 million cartridges/month); and (4) post-IPO statements by executives like Coe and Moody falsely assured readiness for production upon EUA. The Class Period for Exchange Act claims is March 30, 2021 (2020 10-K) to March 15, 2022 (disclosing manufacturing failures, high invalid rates, no launch timeline).

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Sjunde AP-Fonden (AP7) brings this securities class action on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased Lucid Group, Inc. (Lucid) common stock from November 15, 2021, to August 3, 2022 (Class Period). Defendants are Lucid, CEO Peter Rawlinson, and CFO Sherry House. The complaint alleges Defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about Lucid's production capabilities for its Lucid Air electric vehicle, concealing severe internal logistics problems (e.g., dysfunctional inventory systems, overcapacity warehouse, inability to locate and deliver parts, design flaws causing parts shortages, production line shutdowns) and falsely blaming external industry-wide supply chain issues while repeatedly affirming unattainable 2022 production guidance (initially 20,000 vehicles, cut to 12,000-14,000 on February 28, 2022, then to 6,000-7,000 on August 3, 2022). Key factual allegations are supported by detailed accounts from ten former Lucid employees (FEs) describing chaos at Lucid's sole Arizona Plant and Tempe Warehouse, Rawlinson's internal admissions (e.g., <10,000 vehicles in 2022), his frequent site visits, and daily reports/meetings revealing issues. Claims are: Count I - §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; Count II - §20(a) control person liability against Individual Defendants. Partial disclosures caused stock drops: 13% post-February 28 (from $28.98 to $24.99); 9.7% post-August 3 (from $20.56 to $18.56). Motives include Rawlinson's $263M+ stock options vesting on inflated market cap and Lucid's $2B convertible notes offering.",

Materiality obvious: production core to Lucid (sole revenue source, cash burn). Scienter strongly inferred holistically: core operations fraud (Tellabs); Rawlinson's admissions/visits (6-10 warehouse trips); House's denial of inventories; temporal proximity of guidance cuts; motives (Rawlinson's $263M options vesting, $2B notes); no nonculpable inference as compelling (e.g., not mere optimism—contradicted internal data).

      "summary": "This securities class action complaint alleges that Rain Oncology Inc. (formerly Rain Therapeutics Inc.) and its executives—CEO Avanish Vellanki, Chief Medical Officer Richard Bryce, and six board members—made false and materially misleading statements to investors regarding the company's clinical development strategy for milademetan, an MDM2 inhibitor for treating dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Plaintiffs Dr. Myo Thant and Branden Schenkhuizen, on behalf of a class of investors who purchased Rain common stock between April 23, 2021 and May 19, 2023 (the 'Class Period'), allege that defendants falsely represented that Phase 1 trial data from Daiichi Sankyo (the drug's original developer) supported Rain's decision to skip Phase 2 clinical testing and proceed directly to a Phase 3 trial—a 'Phase 2 Bypass.' According to the complaint, this bypass was an extreme departure from customary pharmaceutical development practices, industry standards, and peer-reviewed academic literature, as Phase 2 Bypass is only appropriate when a drug's mechanism of action and safety profile are well-characterized—conditions not met by milademetan, a first-in-human drug historically associated with severe hematologic toxicities. The complaint alleges that defendants repeatedly misrepresented Rain as a 'late-stage' company despite having conducted no clinical trials independently, falsely claimed the Phase 1 data 'validated' the dosing schedule, and concealed the abnormal risks of the Phase 2 Bypass strategy. When Rain announced on May 22, 2023 that its Phase 3 MANTRA trial failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint and showed elevated Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events—suggesting improper dose optimization—the stock price collapsed from $9.93 to $1.22 per share. Plaintiffs assert violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act (against Rain, Vellanki, and Bryce), Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (against Vellanki and Bryce as controlling persons), Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (against Rain and the director defendants), and Section 15 of the Securities Act (against the director defendants). The complaint emphasizes that defendants were motivated by financial necessity—Rain needed capital from its April 2021 IPO and could not afford the $11.2 million cost and two-year delay of a Phase 2 trial—and that the SEC had explicitly warned Vellanki before the IPO not to make certain claims about Rain's stage, clinical trial experience, and product characterizations, warnings that defendants allegedly ignored immediately after the offering closed.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Violation (Count I) - Against Rain, Vellanki, and Bryce",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must plead facts supporting each element: (1) a material misstatement or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud); (3) reliance; (4) economic loss; and (5) loss causation.[4] The complaint satisfies these requirements at the pleading stage. First, material misstatements are adequately alleged: defendants repeatedly represented that Phase 1 data 'validated' a dosing schedule and supported Phase 2 Bypass, when the Phase 1 trial identified only a 'recommended Phase 2 dose' for further testing—a critical distinction. Defendants also falsely characterized Rain as a 'late-stage' company despite conducting no independent clinical trials, contradicting SEC warnings. These statements are material because they directly address the core investment thesis and clinical risk profile. Second, scienter is sufficiently pleaded. The complaint alleges that the SEC sent Vellanki no fewer than three written letters between February and April 2021 explicitly prohibiting the 'late-stage' characterization and requiring removal of 'best-in-class' language; Vellanki then made these exact statements in SEC filings immediately after the IPO closed, suggesting knowing or reckless disregard. The complaint also alleges that a former employee confirmed Vellanki and Bryce understood that Daiichi Sankyo's Phase 1 trial recommended a Phase 2 dose, not a Phase 3 dose, and that both executives had substantial experience in drug development and understood the data limitations. The allegation that defendants engaged in a 'reckless gamble' to avoid conducting a Phase 2 trial (which would have cost $11.2 million and delayed commercialization by two years) to preserve limited capital and achieve first-to-market status, while concealing these risks, supports a strong inference of scienter under the standard articulated in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007)—the inference of scienter is at least as compelling as any opposing inference. Third, reliance is established through the 'fraud-on-the-market' doctrine. The complaint adequately alleges that Rain's stock traded on Nasdaq in an efficient market with hundreds of thousands of shares traded weekly, SEC filings, regular press releases, and analyst coverage, satisfying the prerequisites for presumed reliance. Fourth, economic loss is clearly alleged: plaintiffs purchased Rain stock at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period and suffered losses when the stock price collapsed from $9.93 to $1.22 upon disclosure of the Phase 3 trial failure. Fifth, loss causation is adequately pleaded. The complaint identifies two disclosure events: (1) September 20, 2021, when Daiichi Sankyo published results from a separate milademetan trial showing unusually high hematologic toxicities at the 260 mg dose, causing the stock to decline from $15.88 to $13.21; and (2) May 22, 2023, when Rain announced the Phase 3 MANTRA trial failure with elevated Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events, causing the dramatic decline to $1.22. These disclosures revealed the truth about the risks of Phase 2 Bypass and the improper dose optimization, directly contradicting defendants' prior misrepresentations. The magnitude and timing of the price declines negate any inference of causation by market conditions or industry factors unrelated to the fraud. Accordingly, the complaint states a plausible claim for Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violation."

The complaint adequately alleges that Vellanki and Bryce were controlling persons of Rain. Vellanki is alleged to be Chairman and CEO with 20 years of healthcare and investment banking experience; Bryce is alleged to be Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer with extensive clinical development experience. Both are alleged to have had 'direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of Rain,' access to material non-public information about the Phase 3 trial, and the power to influence or control Rain's decision-making regarding dissemination of statements. The complaint alleges that Vellanki signed each quarterly and annual report containing the false statements and certified them under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 302, knowing or with reckless disregard that they contained untrue statements. The complaint further alleges that Bryce was quoted in press releases promoting the Phase 2 Bypass and that both executives received SEC correspondence warning against specific representations, which they then made anyway. These allegations sufficiently establish that Vellanki and Bryce had the power to control Rain's conduct and the power to prevent or cause correction of the misleading statements. The complaint does not allege facts suggesting good faith or lack of inducement; to the contrary, it alleges knowing or reckless participation. Accordingly, the complaint states a plausible Section 20(a) claim."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Section 11 of the Securities Act imposes liability for material misstatements or omissions in a registration statement. For the issuer (Rain), liability is strict—no scienter requirement. For directors and underwriters (here, the director defendants), liability requires proof of negligence; they have an affirmative defense if they conducted a reasonable investigation and had reasonable grounds to believe the registration statement was accurate. The complaint adequately alleges that Rain's April 23, 2021 registration statement and prospectus contained material misstatements. Specifically, the prospectus represented in at least three instances that Phase 1 data 'validated' a 'rationally-designed dosing schedule' that 'mitigate[d] safety concerns' and supported advancing directly to a Phase 3 trial. However, the Phase 1 trial identified only a 'recommended Phase 2 dose' for further testing, not a validated dose for Phase 3. The complaint alleges this distinction is material because Phase 2 Bypass is only appropriate when a drug's mechanism of action and safety profile are well-characterized—conditions not met by milademetan. The prospectus warned only generically that earlier trial results may not predict later results, but failed to disclose the abnormal, undisclosed, and atypical risks created by the Phase 2 Bypass in deviation from customary practices, industry standards, and academic literature. This omission violated Item 105 of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of the most significant factors making an offering speculative or risky. For Rain, strict liability attaches. For the director defendants, the complaint alleges facts supporting negligence: they signed the registration statement, they had access to Phase 1 trial data and Daiichi Sankyo's clinical trial plan calling for Phase 2 testing, they received SEC feedback about the company's lack of clinical trial experience, and they approved dissemination of statements they should have known were misleading given industry standards. The complaint alleges sufficient facts to defeat the directors' reasonable investigation defense at the pleading stage, particularly given the SEC's prior warnings and the availability of peer-reviewed literature establishing that Phase 2 Bypass outside customary circumstances materially reduces Phase 3 success rates. Accordingly, the complaint states a plausible Section 11 claim."

The complaint alleges that the director defendants were control persons of Rain by virtue of their positions as directors and senior officers with power to control the contents of the registration statement and prospectus. The complaint alleges they had the ability and opportunity to prevent issuance or cause correction of the misleading statements. Because the complaint establishes a plausible Section 11 violation by Rain, and adequately alleges that the director defendants were control persons who did not act in good faith (they approved and signed the registration statement containing known or recklessly disregarded misstatements), Section 15 liability is properly pleaded. Accordingly, the complaint states a plausible Section 15 claim."

      "summary": "This is a securities class action complaint filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased Fastly, Inc. securities between November 15, 2023 and August 7, 2024 (the 'Class Period'). The plaintiffs are the Lead Plaintiff and named plaintiff Ken Kula. The defendants are Fastly, Inc., CEO Todd Nightingale, and CFO Ronald Kisling. The complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding: (1) the impact of macroeconomic trends (rising interest rates, banking instability, recession fears) on Fastly's business; (2) the stability and growth of revenue from existing enterprise customers, particularly Fastly's largest customers; and (3) the company's focus on expanding existing customer relationships. In reality, according to confidential witnesses and internal company data, Fastly's largest customers (including TikTok, Amazon Video, Apple, Twitter/X, Netflix, Paramount, and Disney—representing 37-40% of revenue) were experiencing declining usage, requesting aggressive discounts during contract renewals beginning in March-April 2023, and some were canceling contracts entirely. Defendants knew of these declines through quarterly all-hands meetings where CEO Nightingale discussed customers 'throttling down' usage, weekly Customer Ops meetings tracking customer bandwidth with a red/yellow/green status system, and internal 'tiger teams' assembled to address declining major accounts. Despite this knowledge, defendants publicly downplayed macro impacts (November 2023), claimed customer retention was 'stable' (February 2024), and emphasized continued enterprise customer expansion (February and May 2024 filings). The company also discontinued reporting key metrics (DBNER and quarterly NRR) that would have revealed declining existing customer growth, and implemented a new sales compensation model in 2024 prioritizing new customer acquisition over existing customer expansion—contradicting public statements emphasizing existing customer focus. Stock price declined 30.59% on February 15, 2024 (from $23.54 to $16.34), 32.02% on May 2, 2024 (from $12.93 to $8.79), and 14.33% on August 8, 2024 (from $6.84 to $5.86) upon successive corrective disclosures.

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint satisfies the pleading requirements for a Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim under the heightened pleading standard established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) and articulated in cases such as Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007). To survive a motion to dismiss, a securities fraud complaint must plead: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or recklessness); (3) reliance; (4) economic loss; and (5) loss causation. Each element is adequately pleaded here with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions: The complaint identifies specific false statements made during the Class Period with particularity, including: (a) Nightingale's November 15, 2023 statements that Fastly was 'not seeing' macro headwinds affecting competitors and had 'limited exposure' to SMB customers experiencing pressure—contradicted by confidential witness testimony that 30-40% of sales teams served SMB segments and that customers were requesting aggressive discounts correlated with rising interest rates beginning March-April 2023; (b) February 14, 2024 statements that 'customer retention efforts were stable' and that revenue declines were attributable only to 'weaker than anticipated international traffic' and 'deal elongation'—contradicted by internal evidence that largest customers' traffic was declining, contracts were being canceled (Indeed, USAA), and customers were demanding steeper discounts; (c) February 22, 2024 10-K statements that 'enterprise customers continue to leverage our platform, increasing their spend' and that risks of customer usage decline were hypothetical—contradicted by evidence that revenue from largest customers had been declining since 2023 and that the risk had already materialized; (d) May 1, 2024 10-Q statements emphasizing focus on 'expanding our relationship with existing customers' and 'retaining our customers and expanding their usage'—contradicted by evidence of a new sales compensation model implemented in 2024 that prioritized new customer acquisition over existing customer expansion, reducing incentives for sales teams to pursue existing customer growth. These statements are material because: (i) approximately 95% of Fastly's revenue derived from platform usage, with new customers contributing less than 10% of that revenue; (ii) the top 10 customers generated 37-40% of total revenue; (iii) changes in usage by major customers created material revenue volatility; and (iv) the company's business model depended substantially on existing customer expansion. The omissions are equally material: defendants failed to disclose that macro forces were negatively impacting the business contrary to public statements, that largest customers were experiencing declining traffic and requesting aggressive discounts, that customer contracts were being canceled, and that the company had shifted its strategic focus away from existing customer expansion despite public statements to the contrary. Scienter: The complaint pleads scienter with sufficient particularity to satisfy the 'strong inference' standard. Defendants had actual knowledge of the adverse facts through multiple channels: (1) CEO Nightingale attended quarterly all-hands meetings where he himself discussed how largest accounts had 'throttled down' usage and were 'not bringing in as much traffic,' resulting in decreased revenue; (2) defendants participated in or received reports from weekly Customer Ops meetings (attended by Chief Customer Officer, VP of Global Customer Success, VP of Customer Support, and occasionally Nightingale) that tracked customer bandwidth using a red/yellow/green system, with red-flagged major customers triggering 'tiger team' interventions; (3) the company maintained internal tools (the 'Fastly App') allowing tracking of customer traffic; (4) confidential witnesses with direct knowledge of sales operations reported discussing declining customer appetite and contract cancellations with senior management, including founder Artur Bergman; (5) confidential witnesses in account management roles (CW3, managing $100M+ revenue accounts) reported struggling to meet quotas by November 2023 due to customer stagnation; (6) contract renewal negotiations typically began three months before expiration, meaning defendants knew by early January 2024 (three months before March-April 2024 repricings) that large customers were demanding more favorable terms; (7) Nightingale's own November 2023 statement that he 'track[s] top 10, top 20 deals for any given quarter' demonstrates his personal knowledge of major account dynamics. The inference that defendants acted with scienter is 'cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference' because: (a) the timing of metric discontinuation (ceasing to report DBNER and quarterly NRR beginning Q1 2024, metrics defendants and analysts had regularly discussed) coincides suspiciously with when those metrics would have revealed declining existing customer growth; (b) defendants' insider stock sales during the Class Period ($5.97M for Nightingale; $1.97M for Kisling) while making positive statements about customer growth and retention suggest knowledge of imminent negative developments; (c) the shift to a new sales compensation model prioritizing new customer acquisition, combined with continued public emphasis on existing customer expansion, reflects deliberate concealment; (d) the 'war room' and 'tiger team' assembled after Q1 2024 results to address 'substantial drop in traffic from biggest customers' indicates defendants recognized the severity of the problem but had downplayed it publicly. Recklessness is alternatively established by defendants' failure to investigate or verify the accuracy of statements despite ready availability of information through internal meetings, tracking systems, and direct employee reports. Reliance: The complaint adequately pleads reliance under the 'fraud-on-the-market' doctrine. Fastly securities traded on the NYSE in an efficient market characterized by: (i) active trading; (ii) SEC periodic reporting; (iii) regular press releases and conference calls; (iv) analyst coverage by major brokerage firms. The market reasonably digested publicly available information and reflected it in security prices. Plaintiffs and class members relied on the integrity of the market price and/or on defendants' public statements. Loss Causation: The complaint establishes loss causation through a series of corrective disclosures that removed artificial inflation: (1) February 14, 2024 earnings announcement reporting Q4 2023 revenue at lower end of guidance and missing analyst estimates, resulting in 30.59% stock decline; (2) May 1, 2024 Q1 2024 earnings call disclosing 'reduction of revenue from a small number of largest customers' and downward revenue guidance revision ($580-590M to $555-565M), resulting in 32.02% decline; (3) August 7, 2024 Q2 2024 earnings call disclosing continued revenue declines from largest customers (top 10 revenue share falling from 40% to 34%) and strategic shift to new customer acquisition, resulting in 14.33% decline. Each disclosure directly addressed misrepresentations in prior statements and revealed the materialized risks defendants had concealed. Economic Loss: The complaint alleges that plaintiffs purchased securities at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period and suffered damages upon disclosure of corrective information, as evidenced by the sharp stock price declines. Conclusion: The complaint states a plausible claim for Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 violations by pleading each required element with particularity and supporting the inference of scienter with specific facts demonstrating defendants' knowledge or recklessness. The motion to dismiss should be denied."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act provides that controlling persons of a company that violates the securities laws are jointly and severally liable with the company, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation. To establish Section 20(a) liability, a plaintiff must show: (1) a primary violation by the controlled entity (Fastly); and (2) control by the defendant over the entity. The complaint adequately pleads both elements. Primary Violation: As analyzed above, the complaint establishes a plausible primary violation of Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 by Fastly through its materially false and misleading statements and omissions in SEC filings, earnings calls, press releases, and investor communications during the Class Period. Control: The complaint establishes that Nightingale (CEO) and Kisling (CFO) were controlling persons over Fastly's disclosures. Specifically: (1) As CEO and CFO, they held senior positions with authority over corporate communications; (2) They had 'power and authority to control the contents of Fastly's SEC filings, press releases, and other market communications'; (3) They 'were provided with copies of Fastly's SEC filings and press releases alleged herein to be misleading prior to or shortly after their issuance and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or to cause them to be corrected'; (4) They signed Sarbanes-Oxley certifications certifying the accuracy of the 2023 10-K and Q1 2024 10-Q; (5) They made direct public statements during earnings calls that contained the alleged misrepresentations; (6) They participated in all-hands meetings and Customer Ops meetings where adverse information was discussed; (7) They had access to material non-public information through their executive positions that was not available to the public. Good Faith Defense: The complaint alleges facts that defeat any good faith defense. Defendants cannot claim good faith when they: (a) made knowingly false statements or acted with reckless disregard for truth; (b) had actual knowledge through internal meetings and systems of the facts contradicting their public statements; (c) sold substantial amounts of company stock during the Class Period while making positive statements, suggesting awareness of impending negative developments; (d) orchestrated the discontinuation of key metrics that would have revealed the truth; (e) implemented a sales compensation model contradicting public statements about business strategy. Conclusion: The complaint states a plausible Section 20(a) claim against the Individual Defendants as controlling persons of Fastly's primary securities law violations. The motion to dismiss should be denied."

      "summary": "This securities class action complaint alleges that Vicor Corporation and its CEO Patrizio Vinciarelli made material misrepresentations regarding a purported agreement with a significant existing customer for a new 4G lateral power distribution design product. On July 25, 2023, during an earnings call, Defendants announced that this existing customer would begin ramping production in Q4 2023, representing the first positive news after quarters of declining sales and shrinking backlog. Plaintiffs, who were short sellers of Vicor stock, were forced to cover their short positions at substantial losses following the stock price surge from $59 to over $94 per share on July 26, 2023. On October 24, 2023, during the Q3 earnings call, Defendants denied ever having made representations about a specific significant customer and pivoted to discussing general conversations with unidentified customers. The stock subsequently fell to $39.01. Plaintiffs allege that the July 25 announcement was false when made because no concrete deal existed with an existing significant customer for Q4 2023 delivery, and that Defendants' subsequent denials and eventual admission (via a September 2024 press release mentioning $30 million in non-cancellable orders) constitute a cover-up evidencing scienter. The Complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for securities fraud and Section 20(a) for control person liability. The proposed class consists of all persons who held short positions in Vicor common stock prior to July 25, 2023, and covered those positions between July 26, 2023, and October 24, 2023.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) - Securities Fraud",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads all elements of a Section 10(b) claim under the PSLRA's heightened pleading standards. (1) Misstatement or Omission: Plaintiffs have identified with specificity the July 25, 2023 statements that an 'existing' and 'significant' customer had agreed to ramp production of the new 4G lateral power distribution design in Q4 2023, with specific technical details (1,000 amp level, lateral and lateral-vertical implementations). The October 24, 2023 denial of ever having made such representations constitutes an omission of material information. (2) Materiality: The complaint establishes materiality through concrete evidence—the stock price rose from $59 to over $94 (59% increase) on July 26, 2023, with trading volume reaching 4.5 million shares (approximately 5-6 times normal), and fell to $39.01 (58% decline) on October 25, 2023, following the corrective disclosure. This dramatic price movement and volume spike directly demonstrates that the market considered the statements material. The complaint also establishes materiality through the 'total mix' standard by showing that Defendants' own press release highlighted the company's shrinking backlog and weak bookings, making positive news about a major customer contract fundamentally change the information available to investors. (3) Scienter: The complaint pleads scienter with sufficient particularity to survive dismissal. Vinciarelli, as CEO, had unlimited access to Vicor's customer contracts, sales data, and negotiations. The complaint alleges that Defendants either knew the statements were false or were reckless in not knowing. The specific details provided (1,000 amp level, lateral vs. lateral-vertical implementations, Q4 2023 ramp) suggest actual knowledge rather than mere negligence. The complaint further alleges that the rapid reversal of the customer relationship within three months, combined with Defendants' initial denials followed by a year-later admission via press release only after litigation was filed, supports an inference of scienter. Additionally, Vinciarelli's personal financial incentive (controlling 80% of voting securities, with each $10 stock increase representing $100 million in personal wealth) and the allegation that insiders sold over $1 million in shares at inflated prices following the announcement support scienter. The complaint also alleges that Defendants deliberately refrained from taking steps to verify the customer relationship or installed inadequate disclosure controls. (4) In Connection with Purchase or Sale of Securities: The statements were made during a public earnings call by the CEO, a communication type Defendants knew would be relied upon by investors. Plaintiffs allege they relied on these statements in deciding to cover their short positions, and the market-wide impact demonstrates the statements were 'in connection with' securities transactions. (5) Reliance: The complaint adequately pleads reliance through both direct reliance (Plaintiffs relied on the earnings call announcement) and fraud-on-the-market reliance (the market incorporated the false information into Vicor's stock price, and Plaintiffs relied on the integrity of that market price). The complaint establishes the efficient market presumption by alleging that Vicor is traded on NASDAQ, a highly liquid and efficient market, with active analyst coverage and high trading volumes. (6) Loss Causation: The complaint establishes loss causation by showing that the corrective disclosure on October 24, 2023—when Defendants denied having a significant customer and pivoted to discussing general customer conversations—directly caused the stock price to fall from $93.70 to $39.01. The temporal proximity between the corrective disclosure and the price decline, combined with the abnormal trading volume, establishes that the revelation of the falsity caused Plaintiffs' losses. The complaint also alleges specific damages: Plaintiffs were forced to cover short positions at approximately $35 per share above the price they would have covered at absent the fraud, plus the additional $15 per share loss they would have realized from the subsequent price decline. The complaint's allegations satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement to plead fraud with particularity by identifying the time (July 25, 2023), place (earnings call), manner (oral statements and press release), and content (statements about an existing significant customer ramping in Q4) of the alleged misrepresentations, and by explaining why those statements were false (no such customer existed or the deal was so tentative it fell apart in three months). The motion to dismiss should be DENIED as to this claim."

          "claim": "Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act - Control Person Liability",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Section 20(a) provides that controlling persons of an issuer are jointly and severally liable for violations of the securities laws by the controlled entity, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the violation. The complaint adequately alleges that Vinciarelli qualifies as a control person and is liable for Vicor's Section 10(b) violations. (1) Control Person Status: The complaint alleges that Vinciarelli, as CEO and President, had the power to influence and control the decision-making of Vicor regarding the content and dissemination of the false statements. The complaint further alleges that Vinciarelli owned 93.8% of Class B shares (which carry 10 votes per share) and controlled 80% of all outstanding voting securities, giving him effective control of Vicor's governance. As CEO, he signed quarterly and annual statements and conducted evaluations of disclosure controls and procedures. These allegations are sufficient to establish control person status. (2) Primary Violation: As discussed above, the complaint adequately pleads that Vicor violated Section 10(b) through the misrepresentations about the significant customer. (3) Vinciarelli's Involvement: The complaint alleges that Vinciarelli personally made the false statements during the July 25, 2023 earnings call, directly speaking about the existing customer, the Q4 2023 ramp, and the technical specifications. He is quoted extensively in the complaint making these representations. The complaint further alleges that Vinciarelli had unlimited access to Vicor's contracts, customer lists, sales data, and negotiations, and therefore had the ability to prevent the issuance of the false statements or cause them to be corrected. (4) No Good Faith Defense: The complaint's allegations of scienter, combined with Vinciarelli's personal financial incentive ($100 million increase in net worth for each $10 stock price increase, and insider sales of over $1 million at inflated prices), undermine any potential good faith defense. The complaint alleges that Vinciarelli either knew the statements were false or was reckless in not knowing, precluding a finding of good faith. The motion to dismiss should be DENIED as to this claim."

LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and others). The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively 'Offering Documents'), effective July 28, 2021, contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Robinhood's business strategy to 'democratize finance,' platform safety and reliability, customer focus, and ongoing growth as evidenced by key performance indicators ('KPIs') such as Monthly Active Users ('MAU'), Assets Under Custody ('AUC'), Average Revenue Per User ('ARPU'), and Net Cumulative Funded Accounts ('NCFA'). Key factual allegations include: (1) Robinhood abandoned its stated strategy by operating with inadequate fraud controls, backlogs in fraud reviews, undertrained staff, and app features (e.g., 'blinking dot,' easy options/margin access) designed to encourage rapid, risky trading for revenue via payment for order flow ('PFOF'), leading to customer losses, anger, attrition, and declining Net Promoter Score ('NPS'); (2) sharp pre-IPO declines in KPIs and revenue in May-July 2021 (e.g., MAU down ~20% from 24.1M to 19.5M, crypto volume down >90% or $114B, AUC down ~4.25%, ARPU down >$25, NCFA stagnant), tracked in real-time via internal analytics like Looker, discussed in executive meetings, but not disclosed; (3) violations of SEC Items 303 and 105 by failing to disclose known trends/uncertainties materially impacting revenues and most significant risks. These misstatements/omissions allegedly caused post-IPO stock declines from $38 to as low as $6.81 after revelations in Q3 2021 earnings and subsequent reports. The class period aligns with the IPO on July 30, 2021, for shares acquired pursuant/traceable thereto.

Plaintiffs need only plead that they acquired shares pursuant/traceable to the defective Offering Documents and suffered damages; no scienter, reliance, or loss causation required. Here, the complaint adequately alleges material misrepresentations/omissions: (1) affirmative statements touting successful strategy execution (e.g., 'democratizing finance,' customer-centric focus, platform reliability, ongoing growth via rising KPIs through 2Q21) were false/misleading given contemporaneous declines in KPIs (e.g., MAU -11.62% May-Jun 2021, crypto volume -76%, AUC -4.25%) known via real-time analytics and executive discussions (¶¶12-13, 87-88, CW1-CW5 testimony); (2) inadequate risk factor disclosures (e.g., generic warnings of declines despite actual cratering trends violating Item 303's known trends/uncertainties requirement for material revenue impacts); (3) failure to disclose strategy abandonment (fraud backlogs, predatory features causing attrition/NPS decline). These are not mere puffery but tied to specific, falsified historical/present data (e.g., 2Q21 KPI estimates contradicted by May-July data) and omissions of known facts making statements misleading. Offering Documents contained charts/tables projecting continued growth (¶¶5-9, 150-151), rendering them untrue. Plaintiffs trace purchases to Offering; post-IPO declines establish economic loss. Defendants bear due diligence burden, unproven at pleading stage. Motion dismissed as to this claim."

Elements mirror Section 11 but apply to Prospectus specifically and require 'sale' or solicitation; no scienter or reliance needed, but plaintiffs must negate statutory defenses. Complaint pleads underwriters actively solicited via roadshow, due diligence access, and Prospectus dissemination (¶¶32-57); Robinhood as issuer sold directly.

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action brought by Steamfitters Local 449 Pension & Retirement Security Funds on behalf of all persons who purchased SunPower Corporation common stock during the period from August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022 (the 'Class Period'). The complaint names three defendants: SunPower Corporation, Peter Faricy (CEO, President, and Chairman), and Manavendra S. Sial (former CFO and Executive Vice President). The complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding: (1) the current status and trajectory of SunPower's commercial business, including margin performance and balance sheet strength; (2) the company being on track to meet FY21 financial guidance; and (3) risks associated with product defects and quality issues. The core allegation is that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that cracking defects had already developed in third-party connectors used in nearly all of SunPower's commercial solar systems and that the company would incur tens of millions in replacement costs, rendering prior positive statements about commercial business performance and financial guidance materially false. Throughout the Class Period, defendants repeatedly touted the commercial business as performing well, with 'significantly better' margins and strong bookings, while omitting disclosure of the known defect problem. The artificial inflation was maintained through August 3, 2021 (2Q21 earnings), October 5, 2021 (CIS strategic options announcement), and November 3-4, 2021 (3Q21 earnings), with stock prices reaching as high as $34.61 on November 1, 2021. On December 7, 2021, SunPower updated its installation manual with new warnings about connector cracking. The truth emerged on January 20, 2022, when SunPower disclosed in an after-hours press release that it had identified a cracking issue in third-party connectors affecting 'nearly all' commercial systems and would incur approximately $27 million in Q4 2021 and $4 million in Q1 2022 for replacements. The stock price declined 16.9% (from $19.02 to $15.80) on January 21, 2022, on significantly elevated trading volume.

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 (Against All Defendants)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim under the pleading standards established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) and subsequent case law. Under Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must establish: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or recklessness); (3) reliance; (4) economic loss; and (5) loss causation. The complaint satisfies these elements with particularity as required by FRCP Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA heightened pleading standard. First, materiality is adequately pleaded. The complaint identifies specific false statements made by defendants during earnings calls and in SEC filings regarding the commercial business performing 'significantly better' year-over-year, being 'a point of strength' and 'very healthy,' and the company being 'on track' to meet FY21 guidance. These statements directly concern financial performance and guidance—core matters of investor concern. The omitted facts—that cracking defects had already developed in nearly all commercial systems and would require tens of millions in replacement costs—would significantly alter the total mix of information available to investors and would be important to a reasonable investor's decision. The magnitude of the undisclosed costs ($27 million in Q4 2021 and $4 million in Q1 2022) relative to guidance ranges and segment profitability establishes materiality. Second, scienter is adequately pleaded. The complaint alleges that defendants, as CEO, President, Chairman, and CFO, had direct access to adverse information about product defects through their positions of control and authority. The complaint alleges that the cracking issue 'developed over time' and was sufficiently pervasive to affect 'nearly all' commercial systems. The complaint further alleges that defendants were sufficiently advanced in exploring strategic options for the CIS segment by October 2021 to announce a sale process, and analysts subsequently reported that defendants 'must have learned about the pervasive problem of cracking in third-party components in conducting due diligence' for the sale. The timing and specificity of the December 7, 2021 manual updates adding new warnings about connector cracking—warnings not present in 2019 or 2020 editions—supports an inference that defendants knew of the problem before making the prior positive statements. The complaint alleges that defendants 'deliberately disregarded' the adverse facts, which satisfies the recklessness standard. Third, reliance is adequately pleaded through the fraud-on-the-market doctrine. The complaint alleges that SunPower stock traded on NASDAQ in an efficient market, with regular SEC filings, press releases, analyst communications, and analyst coverage. The misrepresentations were public statements made through official channels (press releases, earnings calls, SEC filings). Under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, investors are presumed to have relied on the integrity of the market price, which incorporates defendants' public misrepresentations. Fourth, economic loss is adequately pleaded. The complaint alleges that class members purchased stock at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period (reaching as high as $34.61) and suffered losses when the truth was revealed on January 20, 2022, causing a 16.9% stock price decline. The complaint alleges that absent the misrepresentations, investors would not have purchased at the prices paid or at all. Fifth, loss causation is adequately pleaded. The complaint establishes a causal connection between the misrepresentations and the stock price inflation, and between the corrective disclosure and the price decline. The January 20, 2022 disclosure of the cracking issue and associated costs directly contradicted prior statements about commercial business strength and financial guidance. The stock price decline immediately following this disclosure, combined with analyst reports recognizing the connection between the disclosed defect and prior guidance misses, establishes that the prior artificial inflation was corrected by the disclosure of the omitted facts. The complaint also adequately pleads that the misrepresentations were material by showing that the stock price reacted significantly to the corrective disclosure, which is probative of materiality. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Count I should be DENIED."

          "claim": "Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act—Control Person Liability (Against Individual Defendants Faricy and Sial)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. Section 20(a) provides that any person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under the securities laws is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation. The complaint establishes control through clear allegations of the Individual Defendants' positions and authority. Faricy is alleged to be CEO, President, and Chairman of the Board of Directors—positions that inherently carry control over the company's operations and public disclosures. Sial is alleged to be CFO and Executive Vice President—positions that provide direct authority over financial reporting and public statements regarding financial performance. The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants 'directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce' and that they 'had the power and authority to cause SunPower to engage in the wrongful conduct complained of herein.' The complaint further alleges that the Individual Defendants participated in drafting, preparing, and approving the false statements, were provided copies of documents prior to issuance, and had the ability to prevent issuance or cause correction. These allegations establish that the Individual Defendants exercised actual control over the company's disclosure practices and public statements. The complaint also adequately pleads that SunPower Corporation itself violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, which is a prerequisite for Section 20(a) liability. Because the underlying Section 10(b) violation is adequately pleaded, and control is adequately pleaded, the Section 20(a) claim survives. The Individual Defendants may assert a good faith defense at a later stage, but that defense is not appropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss when the complaint adequately alleges that defendants acted with scienter and participated in the misrepresentations. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Count II should be DENIED as to the Individual Defendants."

In reality, according to the complaint, AGC's facility—which manufactured Anktiva, ImmunityBio's lead product candidate for bladder cancer treatment—suffered from pervasive and recurring cGMP violations throughout the Class Period, including: (1) failure to timely release batch records; (2) inadequate deviation management and failure to close deviations on schedule; (3) failure to conduct required stability testing within specified timeframes; (4) running out of critical reference material; (5) multiple failed batches; and (6) inadequate quality unit oversight. The complaint alleges that Defendants were aware of these manufacturing deficiencies through monthly meetings with AGC executives, internal quality department communications, FDA Form 483s issued in March and July 2021, a mock inspection in January 2023, and real-time updates during the FDA's pre-license inspection in February 2023. The FDA's pre-license inspection resulted in a scathing 15-page Form 483 with five major categories of violations and an 'Official Action Indicated' (OAI) classification—the most severe FDA classification indicating that one or more manufacturing systems were out of control. On May 11, 2023, ImmunityBio announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) rejecting the Anktiva Biologics License Application (BLA) due to manufacturing deficiencies identified during the pre-license inspection. ImmunityBio's stock price fell 55% on this news. The complaint asserts two causes of action: (1) violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants; and (2) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability) against the Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that Defendants acted with scienter (intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth) based on: (1) their knowledge of FDA cGMP requirements and the critical importance of cGMP compliance to BLA approval; (2) their receipt of FDA Form 483s in March and July 2021; (3) their monthly meetings with AGC discussing manufacturing delays; (4) their placement of contract workers at AGC to address backlogs; (5) their review of an internal 'pre-approval inspection tracker' cataloging cGMP issues; (6) their participation in and review of the mock inspection findings; (7) their real-time monitoring of the FDA pre-license inspection; (8) their initiation of plans to build an in-house cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility, suggesting dissatisfaction with AGC; and (9) the critical importance of Anktiva to the company's business. The complaint alleges loss causation based on the efficient market hypothesis and the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, arguing that the stock price decline on May 11, 2023 was a direct result of the revelation of the manufacturing deficiencies that had been concealed by Defendants' false statements.",

          "claim": "Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 (Against All Defendants)",
          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim against all Defendants. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), plaintiffs must plead with particularity: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) reliance; (4) loss causation; and (5) economic loss. The complaint satisfies these requirements. First, materiality is adequately pleaded. The complaint identifies numerous specific false statements made by Defendants in SEC filings (Forms 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q), press releases, and prospectuses throughout the Class Period, all touting that ImmunityBio had 'established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale' and that its CMO had 'robust process development and validation and quality oversight.' These statements are material because they directly addressed the company's ability to obtain FDA approval for Anktiva, its lead product candidate upon which the company's entire business depended. The complaint alleges that these statements were false because the CMO facility suffered from pervasive cGMP violations that were known to Defendants. The complaint also adequately pleads material omissions—Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) the CMO facility suffered from recurring cGMP failures; (2) the FDA had issued Form 483s in March and July 2021 documenting significant deficiencies; (3) the mock inspection in January 2023 revealed continued cGMP lapses; and (4) these deficiencies posed a serious threat to BLA approval. These omissions are material because they directly contradicted the affirmative representations regarding manufacturing compliance and quality. Second, scienter is adequately pleaded with a strong inference. The complaint alleges facts supporting both actual knowledge and reckless disregard. Regarding actual knowledge: (1) Defendants were seasoned biotech executives who understood FDA cGMP requirements and their criticality to BLA approval, as evidenced by their own SEC filings acknowledging that 'the FDA will not approve an application [BLA] unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities comply with cGMP requirements'; (2) Defendants received FDA Form 483s in March and July 2021 documenting serious deficiencies at the AGC facility; (3) Defendants held monthly or bi-monthly meetings with AGC executives from at least August 2021 through February 2023 to discuss manufacturing delays, batch disposition failures, and deviation management issues; (4) Defendants placed contract workers at the AGC facility in 2022 to address backlogs, indicating awareness of serious manufacturing problems; (5) Defendants maintained an internal 'pre-approval inspection tracker' that cataloged potential cGMP issues at each manufacturing location; (6) Defendants participated in and reviewed findings from a mock inspection in January 2023 that revealed 'rampant cGMP lapses'; (7) Defendants received real-time updates during the FDA's pre-license inspection in February 2023, with Soon-Shiong demanding daily executive-to-executive calls and Adcock flying overnight to the inspection site; and (8) Defendants initiated plans to build an in-house cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility by March 1, 2022, suggesting they were dissatisfied with AGC's capabilities. Regarding reckless disregard: the complaint alleges that Defendants made repeated affirmative representations regarding GMP compliance and manufacturing quality while possessing detailed knowledge of contrary facts. The complaint also alleges that the Individual Defendants were highly motivated to conceal manufacturing problems because Anktiva was critical to the company's survival and the pending BLA represented the company's only path to revenue generation. The complaint further alleges that Defendants' conduct—including their intensive involvement in monitoring the mock inspection and FDA pre-license inspection, their real-time communications during the inspection, and their efforts to remediate identified gaps—demonstrates that Defendants understood the severity of the manufacturing issues. The inference of scienter is further supported by the allegation that Soon-Shiong 'personally reviewed' and 'approved' the BLA before filing, which would necessarily have required him to address the significant number of missed stability checks and failed batch runs documented in the application. Third, reliance is adequately pleaded under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine. The complaint alleges that ImmunityBio's common stock traded on NASDAQ, a highly efficient market; that the company filed periodic SEC reports; that the stock was highly liquid with average daily trading volume of 1.9 million shares; that the company regularly disseminated press releases and other public disclosures; and that the company was followed by securities analysts. These allegations support a presumption of reliance under Basic v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1998). The complaint also adequately pleads reliance under Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128 (1972), based on material omissions. Fourth, loss causation is adequately pleaded. The complaint alleges that on May 11, 2023, ImmunityBio announced that the FDA issued a CRL rejecting the Anktiva BLA due to manufacturing deficiencies identified during the pre-license inspection, and that the stock price fell 55% on heavy volume. The complaint alleges that this price decline directly resulted from the revelation of the manufacturing deficiencies that had been concealed by Defendants' false statements. The timing and magnitude of the price decline support the inference that the decline was caused by the disclosure of the fraud rather than by changed market conditions or unrelated company-specific facts. Fifth, economic loss is adequately pleaded. The complaint alleges that Lead Plaintiff and other Class members purchased ImmunityBio securities at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period and suffered damages when the true facts regarding manufacturing deficiencies were revealed. The complaint satisfies the PSLRA's requirement that fraud be pleaded with particularity. The complaint identifies: (1) the 'who' (Defendants); (2) the 'what' (false statements regarding GMP manufacturing capacity and CMO quality); (3) the 'when' (specific dates of false statements in SEC filings and press releases throughout the Class Period); (4) the 'where' (SEC filings, press releases, and public disclosures); and (5) the 'how' (affirmative misrepresentations and material omissions regarding manufacturing compliance). The complaint also provides specific factual allegations supporting a strong inference of scienter, as required by the PSLRA. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim should be DENIED."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads a Section 20(a) claim against the Individual Defendants. Section 20(a) provides that any person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under the securities laws is also liable jointly and severally with the controlled person, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation. To establish Section 20(a) liability, a plaintiff must show: (1) a primary violation by the controlled entity (ImmunityBio); (2) the defendant's control over the controlled entity; and (3) that the defendant failed to act in good faith or directly or indirectly induced the primary violation. The complaint adequately pleads all three elements. First, the complaint establishes a primary violation by ImmunityBio under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, as discussed above. Second, the complaint adequately pleads that the Individual Defendants controlled ImmunityBio. The complaint alleges that: (1) Soon-Shiong was the founder and Executive Chairman of the Board and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, holding approximately 82% of the company's outstanding common stock immediately following the merger; (2) Adcock was the CEO and a member of the Board; (3) Sachs was the CFO; (4) the Individual Defendants had 'direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of ImmunityBio'; (5) the Individual Defendants had 'unlimited access' to copies of the company's reports, press releases, public filings, and other statements; (6) the Individual Defendants had 'the power to influence and control, and did influence and control, directly or indirectly, the decision-making of the Company, including the content and dissemination of the false and misleading statements'; and (7) the Individual Defendants 'exercised their power and authority to cause ImmunityBio to engage in the wrongful acts alleged herein or personally participate in the unlawful conduct alleged.' These allegations establish that the Individual Defendants had the requisite control over ImmunityBio. Third, the complaint adequately pleads that the Individual Defendants failed to act in good faith and/or directly or indirectly induced the primary violation. The complaint alleges that: (1) the Individual Defendants signed or approved the false SEC filings and press releases; (2) the Individual Defendants had actual knowledge of the manufacturing deficiencies at AGC through their monthly meetings, receipt of FDA Form 483s, participation in the mock inspection, and real-time monitoring of the FDA pre-license inspection; (3) the Individual Defendants made affirmative representations regarding GMP compliance and manufacturing quality while possessing knowledge of contrary facts; (4) the Individual Defendants failed to disclose known manufacturing deficiencies; and (5) the Individual Defendants had the power to prevent the issuance of false statements or cause them to be corrected but chose not to do so. These allegations establish that the Individual Defendants failed to act in good faith and directly or indirectly induced ImmunityBio's primary violations. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the Section 20(a) claim should be DENIED."

The complaint alleges a fraudulent accounting scheme involving approximately $2.2 million in 'last mile' shipping expenses (costs of transporting finished products from distribution centers to customers) that were improperly recorded and concealed from investors and the Commission. The defendants allegedly discovered in April 2023 that these shipping expenses, which should have been recorded in fiscal year 2023, were instead improperly recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Rather than correcting the error through a restatement, Dellomo and Um allegedly devised a scheme to capitalize the $2.2 million as an asset and amortize it over the remaining three quarters of FY 2024, thereby artificially maintaining Lovesac's gross margin at the publicly disclosed projection of 50.1% and avoiding the need to restate prior financial statements. This improper accounting treatment violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The scheme allegedly involved: (1) Dellomo and Um's knowledge that the accounting treatment was not GAAP-compliant; (2) the creation and approval of a fraudulent journal entry on April 26-27, 2023; (3) Dellomo's false certification of the Q1 2024 Form 10-Q; (4) Dellomo's submission of false management representation letters to the company's outside auditor; and (5) the filing of four materially false or misleading SEC filings (FY 2023 Form 10-K filed March 29, 2023; Form 8-K filed March 28, 2023; Q1 2024 Form 10-Q filed June 9, 2023; and Form 8-K filed June 7, 2023). The company restated its financial statements for FY 2023 and Q1 2024 on August 16, 2023. The class period spans from the initial false statements through the restatement announcement. The complaint asserts fifteen separate causes of action against the defendants, including securities fraud under Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1) and (3); fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; books and records violations under Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A); internal controls violations under Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B); false certifications under Rule 13a-14; and various aiding and abetting claims.\",\n  \"claim_rulings\": [\n    {\n      \"claim\": \"Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and (3) - Fraud in the Offer or Sale of Securities (Against Dellomo and Um)\",\n      \"ruling\": \"sustained\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"The complaint adequately alleges violations of Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and (3) against both Dellomo and Um. For Section 17(a)(1), the complaint alleges that Dellomo and Um knowingly or recklessly employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud in connection with the offer or sale of securities. The factual allegations establish: (1) a scheme to conceal $2.2 million in out-of-period shipping expenses through improper capitalization; (2) knowledge or recklessness regarding non-compliance with GAAP; (3) intent to manipulate gross margin figures to meet publicly disclosed projections; and (4) connection to securities offerings (Lovesac's registered common stock). For Section 17(a)(3), the complaint alleges negligent engagement in transactions, practices, or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit. The allegations satisfy the pleading requirements by specifying the 'who, what, when, where, and how' of the fraud: the defendants (who), the improper journal entry capitalizing shipping expenses (what), April 26-27, 2023 (when), Lovesac's accounting records and SEC filings (where), and the deliberate concealment through false accounting entries and certifications (how). The complaint demonstrates scienter through Dellomo and Um's status as experienced CPAs who knew or were reckless in not knowing that their accounting treatment violated GAAP, combined with their express statements in Teams chats indicating discomfort with the improper treatment and concern about job security, suggesting consciousness of wrongdoing. The materiality of the $2.2 million adjustment (140 basis points impact on gross margin, representing a material metric disclosed to investors) is adequately pleaded.

Section 17(a)(3) requires only negligence, not scienter. The complaint establishes: (1) Lovesac's filing of four materially false or misleading SEC filings (FY 2023 Form 10-K, FY 2023 Form 8-K, Q1 2024 Form 10-Q, and Q1 2024 Form 8-K); (2) the specific false statements and omissions in each filing, including failure to disclose out-of-period shipping expenses, the improper capitalization, the fraudulent journal entry, and material weaknesses in internal controls; (3) the connection to the offer or sale of securities through Lovesac's registered common stock trading on Nasdaq; and (4) the use of means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce (SEC filings, electronic communications). The complaint alleges that Lovesac's management failed to implement sufficient internal controls and failed to disclose material information necessary to make the filings not misleading. As a public company issuer, Lovesac had a duty to ensure the accuracy and completeness of its SEC filings. The negligence standard is satisfied by allegations that Lovesac's finance and accounting personnel discovered the $2.2 million discrepancy and that management approved the improper accounting treatment without adequate support or materiality analysis.

Rule 10b-5(a) prohibits the use of manipulative and deceptive devices; Rule 10b-5(c) prohibits engaging in acts, practices, or courses of business which operate as a fraud or deceit. To state a claim, plaintiffs must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud); (3) connection with the purchase or sale of securities; (4) reliance; and (5) loss causation. The complaint adequately pleads each element. Material Misrepresentation/Omission: The complaint specifies that Lovesac's SEC filings contained materially false statements regarding gross margin (50.1% when it should have been lower), the proper classification of expenses, and the adequacy of internal controls. The $2.2 million adjustment represented 140 basis points of gross margin, a material metric explicitly disclosed to investors on earnings calls. Scienter: The complaint alleges that Dellomo and Um, both experienced CPAs, knew or were reckless in not knowing that capitalizing shipping expenses violated GAAP. Their own communications (Teams chats) show Um stating 'I don't know how to support [it]' and expressing concern about the auditors detecting the issue ('a giant black eye for the auditors to pick out'), demonstrating consciousness of wrongdoing. Dellomo's approval of the journal entry without supporting documentation, contrary to her normal practice, further supports scienter. Connection to Purchase or Sale: The defendants' conduct was directly connected to the trading of Lovesac's common stock, which trades on Nasdaq. The false financial statements were disseminated to the market and relied upon by investors. Reliance and Loss Causation: The complaint adequately alleges that investors relied on Lovesac's materially false financial statements in purchasing or holding securities, and that when the truth was revealed through the August 2023 restatement, the stock price declined. The complaint satisfies the heightened pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act by specifying the false statements, explaining why they were misleading, and pleading facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.

Rule 10b-5(b) specifically addresses misstatements and omissions. The complaint alleges that Dellomo: (1) falsely certified Lovesac's Q1 2024 Form 10-Q, certifying that the financial statements fairly presented the company's financial condition and that she had disclosed all material weaknesses and fraud to the audit committee and auditors, when in fact the filing omitted the $2.2 million out-of-period shipping expenses and the improper capitalization; (2) submitted a false management representation letter to the outside auditor falsely representing that the interim financial information was prepared in conformity with GAAP, that the company had provided all relevant information to the auditor, that accounting estimates were appropriate, that there were no improperly recorded transactions, and that all deferred expenditures were recoverable; and (3) failed to disclose the $2.2 million issue when the auditor specifically asked about unusual transactions or entries not compliant with GAAP. These constitute material misstatements and omissions. The materiality of the $2.2 million adjustment (140 basis points of gross margin) is adequately pleaded. Dellomo's scienter is demonstrated by her status as an experienced CFO and CPA, her knowledge of GAAP requirements, her approval of the improper journal entry, and her deliberate failure to disclose the issue to auditors despite her obligation to do so.

All three elements are adequately pleaded. Primary Violation: The complaint establishes Dellomo's primary violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) through her false certification of the Q1 2024 Form 10-Q and her false management representation letter to the auditor. Substantial Assistance: Um provided substantial assistance by: (1) creating the fraudulent journal entry capitalizing the $2.2 million in shipping expenses; (2) coordinating with Dellomo to devise the improper accounting treatment; (3) implementing the scheme by booking the entry in the general ledger; and (4) concealing the issue from the auditor. The journal entry was the linchpin of the fraudulent scheme; without Um's creation and booking of the entry, Dellomo could not have made the false statements and omissions. Knowledge/Recklessness: Um's knowledge is demonstrated by her Teams communications stating 'I don't know how to support [it]' and 'I don't know how to tell [Dellomo] I don't feel comfortable with it[.]' These statements show Um knew the accounting treatment was improper yet proceeded anyway.

Section 13(b)(5) provides that no person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls, or knowingly falsify any book, record, or account. The complaint establishes: (1) Dellomo's knowledge of the improper accounting treatment, as evidenced by her approval of Um's journal entry and her discussions with Um about the scheme; (2) her failure to implement adequate internal controls, as she was responsible for Lovesac's internal control structure as CFO and was aware of the control failures that allowed the $2.2 million discrepancy to occur; (3) her knowing falsification of books and records by approving the improper journal entry that capitalized the $2.2 million in shipping expenses in violation of GAAP; and (4) her circumvention of existing controls by approving the entry without the supporting documentation she normally required. The complaint alleges that Dellomo, as CFO, was responsible for Lovesac's internal control structure and was aware of the issues underlying the internal control failures. Her approval of the improper journal entry, contrary to her normal practice of requiring detailed accounting support, constitutes knowing circumvention of controls.

Blair (President and CEO), Matthew R. McGrew (CFO), and Emmanuel Ligner (Vice President and Group Executive of Biotechnology segment and CEO of Cytiva). The complaint alleges that Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct by issuing materially false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period regarding the health and growth prospects of Danaher's bioprocessing business (primarily within Cytiva and Pall, generating ~$7.5B in revenue by end-2021), which had benefited from COVID-19 demand but faced unraveling due to: (i) customers shifting from COVID-related projects as the disease became endemic; (ii) large pharmaceutical customers stockpiling inventory from pandemic-era orders with long lead times, reducing new orders; and (iii) smaller biotech startups facing funding constraints amid rising interest rates, leading to project prioritization and delays. Key factual allegations include: Defendants' repeated optimistic guidance on COVID and non-COVID bioprocessing revenues/core growth (e.g., initial $2B COVID sales and high single/low double-digit growth for 2022, later revised downward multiple times to declines); dismissal of analyst concerns on stockpiling and funding; contradictory internal knowledge via monthly forecasts from operating companies (per CW1-4), customer surveys, and Danaher Business System; piecemeal downward revisions (e.g., Oct. 20, 2022: $800M COVID/ high single-digit growth; Jan. 24, 2023: $150M COVID/high single-digit non-COVID; Apr. 25, 2023: low single-digits; Jul. 25, 2023: low single-digit base growth with declines), each triggering stock drops; scienter evidence via executive stock sales (Blair: ~$12.2M; McGrew: ~$5.6M), Ligner's departure, core business centrality (~25% of revenue), and analyst probing. Legal claims: Count I (Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 against all Defendants for material misrepresentations/omissions, scienter, reliance via fraud-on-the-market, loss causation via corrective disclosures); Count II (Section 20(a) against Blair/McGrew as controlling persons over primary violation). Significant dates: Class Period start (Jan. 27, 2022: initial guidance); end (Oct. 23, 2023: final revelations); multiple revision dates (e.g., Apr. 21/Jul. 21/Oct. 20 2022; Jan. 24/Apr. 25/Jul. 25/Oct. 24 2023) with stock declines.",

Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005); Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. 258 (2014)).

Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007)). Here, the complaint identifies specific statements (e.g., Blair's assurances of flat $2B COVID sales/high single-low double-digit growth on Jan. 27, 2022; repeated non-COVID strength claims despite revisions), but fails materiality and falsity: statements were forward-looking opinions on forecasts with PSLRA safe harbor protection (meaningful cautionary language on COVID fluctuations/endemic transition, e.g., Jan. 27, 2022 8-K), tied to then-existing customer data/backlogs, and puffery ('strong foundation,' 'robust activity') not actionable as too vague (Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Indus. Pension Fund, 575 U.S. 175 (2015)). Revisions reflect changing conditions (pandemic normalization, funding shifts), not prior knowledge of falsity; no contemporaneous facts showing statements lacked reasonable basis when made. Item 303 omissions non-actionable absent duty to disclose known trends 'reasonably likely' to materialize adversely (Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley, 776 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2015)). Scienter inference weak: CW allegations vague/don't contradict public data (CW4 hearsay, no specifics on Blair 'making up' numbers); stock sales routine/PSU-driven/Rule 10b5-1 planned, not suspicious timing; no core operations inference overcomes 'innocent' explanation of evolving market (Tellabs). Loss causation speculative; declines tied to broader market/biotech slowdown, not specific disclosures of prior fraud. Dismissed without prejudice; plaintiffs may replead."

      "summary": "This securities class action complaint alleges that Walmart Inc. and its executives, CEO Douglas C. McMillon and CFO M. Brett Biggs (collectively 'Defendants'), violated federal securities laws by concealing government investigations into Walmart's systematic violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) related to improper dispensing and distribution of opioids. Lead Plaintiffs Kim Kengle (trustee) and Roseanne Lacy represent a class of investors who purchased Walmart common stock during the Class Period from March 31, 2017 (filing of Walmart's 2016 10-K) to December 22, 2020 (DOJ civil complaint filing), held shares on March 24, 2020 and/or December 22, 2020, and suffered damages. Key factual allegations include: Walmart's failure to comply with a 2011 DEA settlement (MOA) requiring CSA compliance measures like suspicious order monitoring and red-flag prescription refusal; internal acknowledgments of non-compliance risking severe financial/reputational harm; a 2016-2018 EDTX DOJ criminal investigation culminating in a threatened indictment (averted via lobbying); a parallel civil investigation; filling thousands of invalid prescriptions from pill-mill doctors and failing to report suspicious orders; press releases falsely portraying Walmart as an opioid 'steward'; and nondisclosure in SEC filings despite GAAP (ASC 450), Item 103, and Item 105 requirements. Corrective disclosures—a March 25, 2020 ProPublica article revealing the investigations and December 22, 2020 DOJ complaint—caused stock drops of ~5% ($5.63/share) and ~1.88% ($2.75/share), respectively.

Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005); PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)). The complaint satisfies connection, reliance (fraud-on-the-market), economic loss, and loss causation via specific stock drops post-disclosures. However, it fails materiality, omission duty, and scienter. Statements like 'all reasonably possible material liabilities disclosed' (10-K/10-Q contingencies notes) are non-actionable puffery or opinions under Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr.

Vague 'governmental subpoenas/investigations' disclosures (e.g., 1Q 2018 10-Q) and risk factors are forward-looking/cautionary, protected by PSLRA safe harbor and Bespeaks Caution Doctrine (In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357 (3d Cir. 1993)). No duty to disclose uncharged investigations (Item 103 covers only 'contemplated' proceedings with specifics; Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. 27 (2011)); GAAP/ASC 450 'reasonably possible' threshold unmet absent probable material loss estimate. Press releases (e.g., opioid stewardship) are non-specific, non-actionable corporate optimism. Scienter fails PSLRA's 'strong inference' standard (Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007)): core operations inference weak for executives distant from pharmacy compliance; no specific contemporaneous facts showing Individual Defendants' knowledge of Investigations' materiality (group pleading rejected post-PSLRA); internal docs (e.g., 2014 PSW) predate Class Period; hiring Rachel Brand and DOJ lobbying suggest mitigation, not concealment intent; motive (sales via pharmacies) generic, insufficient (Novartis AG v.

Turnipseed bring this federal securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of GoHealth, Inc. ('GoHealth' or 'Company') Class A common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, 'Registration Statement') for the Company's IPO on July 17, 2020, involving 44.5 million shares priced at $21.00 per share, generating over $913 million in gross proceeds (class period: purchases in and/or traceable to the IPO). Defendants include issuer GoHealth; Individual Defendants Clinton P. Jones (CEO and Co-Chair), Brandon M. Cruz (Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Chair), and Travis J. Matthiesen (CFO), who signed the Registration Statement; controlling shareholders NVX Holdings (controlled by Founders Jones and Cruz) and Centerbridge Partners entities (private equity sponsor that acquired control in 2019); and Underwriter Defendants Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. The alleged misconduct involves strict liability (no scienter alleged) claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act for material misstatements and omissions in the Registration Statement. Key factual allegations: GoHealth operates a health insurance marketplace focused on Medicare Advantage plans, touting rapid growth, industry-leading LTV/CAC ratio (lifetime value of commissions per customer acquisition cost), and strong carrier relationships, particularly with Humana (40% of 2019 revenues) and Anthem (20% of 2019 revenues, rising to 74% combined in 1Q2020); however, the Registration Statement falsely portrayed scalability and growth prospects by omitting that (i) growth was unsustainably reliant on these two carriers, which had been maximized; (ii) GoHealth planned 2020 as an 'investment year' with rapid expansion to new carriers (e.g., UnitedHealth, Aetna, Kaiser) and increased SNP sales, causing lower initial commissions, marketing subsidies loss, higher churn/persistence costs, non-commissionable revenue drag on LTV, and overall LTV/CAC pressure (benefits deferred to 2021); and (iii) violations of SEC Items 303, 105, and SAB 104 for failing to disclose these known trends/uncertainties. Post-IPO disclosures (e.g., 2Q/3Q2020 earnings calls, December 2020 conference) revealed these issues, causing stock decline from $21 to $10.05 low. Legal claims: Count I (Section 11) against GoHealth, Individual Defendants, and Underwriters for negligent preparation of materially false/misleading Registration Statement; Count II (Section 15 control person liability) against Individual Defendants, NVX Holdings, Centerbridge, and GoHealth predicated on Section 11 primary violation.",

Here, the complaint adequately pleads material omissions under the 'reasonable investigation' standard: GoHealth touted rapid growth, peer-leading LTV/CAC (e.g., 3.9x in 2019 Medicare-Internal), scalability via carrier relationships/expansion, and Medicare focus without disclosing that (i) growth relied on unsustainable concentration in Humana/Anthem (74% 1Q2020 revenues); (ii) Company had maximized this model and planned 'investment year' 2020 with new carrier additions (lower commissions, no marketing subsidies, data gaps, agent training costs) and SNP emphasis (non-commissionable revenue, higher churn), dragging LTV/CAC near-term; and (iii) these known trends (per real-time data/models) violated Item 303 (known uncertainties materially impacting revenues, e.g., LTV compression confirmed post-IPO), Item 105 (inadequate risk disclosure, boilerplate warnings misleadingly implied expansion mitigated risks), and SAB 104 (undisclosed sales channel/customer class shifts). Statements like 'rapidly scale while improving LTV/CAC,' 'deep/expanding carrier relationships enhance LTV at lower CAC,' and forward-looking growth were rendered misleading absent these facts, as post-IPO revelations (e.g., August 2020 call: 'initial ramp-up...lower LTVs,' 'short-term drag'; December 2020: 'investment year' with LTV compression) showed falsity. Individual Defendants (signers/executives with oversight) failed reasonable investigation duty; Underwriters (lead managers purchasing/reselling ~69% shares) similarly negligent in due diligence/roadshow, unable to rely solely on issuer representations for core metrics like LTV/CAC amid red flags (e.g., carrier concentration, complex 'black box' calculations).

Complaint adequately alleges: Individual Defendants (directors/officers who signed Registration Statement, prepared/reviewed it, controlled Company via positions) had actual control over contents and culpable participation via failure to correct omissions despite access to real-time data/models revealing trends; NVX Holdings/Centerbridge (post-IPO ~71% voting power, 'controlled company' per Nasdaq, influenced Board/management/stockholder matters per Registration Statement) exercised actual de facto control as majority owners/private equity sponsor (acquired 2019, IPO beneficiary via Transactions redeeming interests), with culpable participation via influence over disclosures tied to earnouts/growth incentives.

The complaint alleges that Defendants engaged in predatory 'death spiral' financing through two convertible promissory notes (September 2018 Note for $247,500 and April 2021 Note for $825,000), extracting over $38 million in heavily discounted DarkPulse stock via 18+ conversions, which Defendants immediately sold into the public market, diluting shareholders and depressing stock price.

Plaintiff alleges 61-291% effective APR (including OID, discounts, commitment shares valued $1.14M), but §1962(c) targets 'conducting affairs,' not just collection—allegations conflate enterprise conduct with standalone usury collections lacking ongoing criminal scheme distinct from contract dispute.

Sloan (former CEO), John R. Shrewsberry (former CFO), C. Allen Parker (former interim CEO and General Counsel), Charles W. Scharf (CEO from October 2019), and Elizabeth “Betsy” Duke (former Board Chair). The Class Period is February 2, 2018, to March 12, 2020. The complaint alleges that Defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Wells Fargo’s compliance with 2018 Consent Orders imposed by the Federal Reserve (FRB), OCC, and CFPB following prior scandals involving unauthorized accounts and risk management failures. These Orders imposed an asset cap prohibiting growth until compliance through three stages: (1) submission and approval of detailed Stage 1 Plans, (2) implementation, and (3) validation. Key factual allegations include: Regulators repeatedly rejected Wells Fargo’s deficient Stage 1 Plans as 'materially incomplete,' 'poor-quality,' 'a plan for a plan,' and containing 'pervasive inaccuracies' and 'illogical timeframes' (e.g., FRB rejections on May 7, 2018, and March 11, 2019; OCC rejections on July 24, 2018, and November 21, 2018); Defendants received stern rebukes, extension requests were repeatedly granted (e.g., to April 2020), and internal admissions confirmed non-compliance (e.g., Board emails calling submissions 'totally biffed it'); yet Defendants assured investors the Bank had 'plans in place,' was 'executing/implementing' them, and expected asset cap lift by mid-2019; Sloan falsified proxy disclosures and lied to Congress; post-Sloan, Parker, Shrewsberry, Duke, and Scharf continued misrepresentations. House Financial Services Committee reports (March 2020) confirmed misstatements, leading to resignations, clawbacks, and $54B market cap loss via corrective disclosures (e.g., January/April 2019 earnings calls, March 2020 hearings).

House Reports corroborate falsity. Omission of rejections, rebukes, and threats of enforcement was material as compliance/asset cap was core to investors (analyst focus). **Scienter**: Strong inference via core operations doctrine (compliance was 'tone at top' focus, Defendants signed Orders, received rejection letters addressed to Sloan/Duke, attended rebuke meetings, requested extensions, Sloan apologized privately to FRB, edited disclosures to hide 'substantial work,' sudden resignations/clawbacks, House findings of inaccuracy). Confidential witnesses/regulator testimony via House Reports bolsters. Outweighs non-scienter inferences (e.g., optimism). Tellabs, Inc. v.

      "summary": "This is a securities class action complaint filed by Lead Plaintiff Steven Christiansen on behalf of purchasers of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. common stock during the period March 17, 2022 through September 22, 2022 (the 'Class Period'). The defendants are Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Thomas J. Riga (President and CEO), Francois J. Lebel (former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer), and Nora E. Brennan (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer). The complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts regarding the development of poziotinib (pozi), an investigational cancer drug, and the status of the PINNACLE Study, a Phase 3 confirmatory trial required by the FDA as a condition of accelerated approval. Specifically, defendants allegedly misrepresented that: (1) Spectrum had 'learned to optimize' the dosage for pozi when the FDA had repeatedly informed defendants that dose optimization data were inadequate; (2) patients were enrolling in the PINNACLE Study when, as of multiple dates during the Class Period, no patients had enrolled; and (3) Spectrum and the FDA were 'aligned' on the PINNACLE Study design when the FDA had not agreed to the proposed 8 mg BID dosing regimen and warned defendants they were proceeding at their own risk. The complaint further alleges that defendants were motivated by financial desperation—Spectrum was projected to run out of cash by year-end 2022—and used these misrepresentations to support at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings that raised approximately $26.6 million during the Class Period. The fraud was revealed on September 20, 2022, when the FDA released its briefing document disclosing the agency's serious concerns about pozi's efficacy, safety, and lack of dose optimization, and revealing that zero patients had enrolled in the PINNACLE Study. Spectrum's stock price declined 37% on September 20 and an additional 31% on September 23 following the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, where the committee voted 9-4 against recommending approval. On November 25, 2022, Spectrum received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and announced it would deprioritize the poziotinib program. The complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 (against all defendants) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (against the individual defendants as controlling persons).",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "To state a claim for violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must allege: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or at minimum recklessness); (3) reliance on the misrepresentation; (4) economic loss; and (5) loss causation. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), a complaint must specify each false statement or misleading omission and explain why it was misleading, and must plead facts giving rise to a 'strong inference' of scienter. The complaint here satisfies these requirements. Materiality: The complaint alleges specific, concrete misrepresentations regarding dose optimization, patient enrollment status in the PINNACLE Study, and FDA alignment—all material to investors' valuation of the company and the poziotinib program. The FDA's subsequent disclosures confirmed these were material; the stock price declined 37% and then 31% upon revelation of the truth. The complaint details multiple false statements made during earnings calls, press releases, and SEC filings throughout the Class Period, with particular emphasis on the May 12, 2022 representations that 'patients are being randomized' into PINNACLE and that defendants were 'aligned with FDA' on the study design, when in fact zero patients had enrolled and the FDA had explicitly warned defendants they were proceeding at their own risk. Scienter: The complaint pleads facts sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter through knowledge or reckless disregard. Defendants Riga and Lebel participated in multiple meetings with the FDA (July 16, 2021; November 13, 2021; December 13, 2021; February 7, 2022; May 18, 2022; July 28, 2022; September 8, 2022) at which FDA officials repeatedly and explicitly communicated concerns about inadequate dose optimization data, the lack of agreement on the PINNACLE Study design, warnings that proceeding was at defendants' own risk, and the absence of patient enrollment. The complaint alleges defendants had actual knowledge of these FDA communications, making their contemporaneous public statements to the contrary (e.g., 'we have learned to optimize,' 'patients are being randomized,' 'aligned with FDA') knowingly false. Alternatively, defendants' reckless disregard is established by their direct participation in FDA meetings where these critical facts were communicated, combined with their senior executive positions giving them authority over investor communications. Motive and opportunity are also pleaded: defendants were motivated by Spectrum's precarious cash position (projected to run out by end of 2022) and used the misrepresentations to support ATM offerings that raised $26.6 million. Reliance and Loss Causation: The complaint adequately pleads reliance through the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, establishing that Spectrum's stock traded in an efficient market (NASDAQ-listed, SEC-reporting company, covered by multiple research analysts, eligible for Form S-3 registration). The timing and magnitude of the stock price declines—37% on September 20 when the FDA briefing document revealed the truth, and an additional 31% on September 23 following the ODAC vote—directly correlate to the revelation of defendants' misrepresentations and omissions, establishing loss causation. The complaint alleges that absent the fraudulent inflation, investors would not have purchased at the prices they paid. The complaint adequately pleads all elements of a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act imposes liability on controlling persons of entities that violate the securities laws. A controlling person is one who possesses the power to control the actions of the entity and the person(s) who committed the primary violation. The complaint adequately alleges that each individual defendant was a controlling person of Spectrum. Riga, as President and CEO and board member, exercised direct authority over the company's public statements, participated in earnings calls and investor conferences, signed SEC filings (including the Q1 2022 10-Q), and approved press releases. Lebel, as Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, similarly participated in public communications, earnings calls, and investor conferences, and made specific false statements regarding dose optimization and PINNACLE Study enrollment. Brennan, as Chief Financial Officer and former board member, signed SEC filings (the Q2 2022 10-Q) and participated in earnings calls. The complaint establishes that each defendant, by virtue of their senior executive positions and board membership, possessed the power to control the contents of the company's reports to the SEC, press releases, and investor presentations, and that they exercised this power during the Class Period. The complaint also establishes that each defendant had the ability and opportunity to prevent the issuance of false statements or cause them to be corrected, as they were provided copies of the company's reports and press releases prior to or shortly after issuance. Having established the primary violation under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (as discussed above), and having established that each individual defendant was a controlling person with the power to control the actions of Spectrum and the individuals who committed the violations, the complaint states a claim under Section 20(a). No affirmative defense (such as good faith) is pleaded by defendants at the motion to dismiss stage, and the complaint's allegations of knowing misstatements and reckless disregard preclude any inference of good faith."

The alleged misconduct includes: (1) Capone fabricating his educational credentials, falsely claiming a graduate degree in computational learning theory (a subset of AI) from Clarkson University and linking it to DocGo's proprietary AI platform, which was touted as the company's key differentiator in medical transportation and mobile health; (2) Capone inflating the value of a potential U.S. Customs and Border Protection ('CBP') contract from ~$2 billion to over $4 billion and falsely claiming DocGo's $432 million no-bid New York City HPD migrant services contract provided credibility to win it; and (3) falsely stating DocGo had enrolled over 3,000 migrants in New York State Medicaid via UnitedHealthcare to generate long-term payer revenue, when DocGo had no such contract or enrollment capability. Key supporting facts include repeated false statements in proxy statements, SEC filings, investor conferences (e.g., JPMorgan, Canaccord Genuity), company websites, and proposals; poor execution of the HPD contract drawing scrutiny; corrective disclosures via Times Union articles on September 10 and 14, 2023, revealing the lies, leading to Capone's resignation on September 15, 2023, and a >56% stock drop from $11.41 (October 11, 2022) to $4.88 (September 18, 2023).

Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005)). Here, all elements are adequately pled. **Material Misrepresentation/Omission**: The complaint specifies numerous false statements (e.g., ¶¶70-92), including Capone's repeated claims of a nonexistent AI graduate degree tied to DocGo's 'technology backbone' (material as analysts called it the 'secret sauce' and AI was a key differentiator); inflation of CBP contract value from <$2B to >$4B; and false Medicaid enrollments. These were false when made, as confirmed by later admissions and reporting. **Scienter**: Strong inference of intent or recklessness via PSLRA standard (Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007)). Capone personally fabricated credentials in speeches, filings, and proposals; as CEO, he knew contract details and had access to nonpublic info. Vashovsky and Oberholzer signed false proxies/8-Ks touting Capone's credentials without verification, despite 'core operations' duty; 'group pleading' applies given their oversight roles. No equally compelling innocent inference. **Reliance**: Fraud-on-the-market presumption applies (Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988)), as DocGo traded efficiently on NASDAQ with analyst coverage and prompt price reactions. **Economic Loss & Loss Causation**: Alleged with specificity—stock dropped 10.76% post-September 10 disclosures (CBP/Medicaid lies) and 25%+ post-September 14/15 disclosures (credentials/Capone resignation), totaling >56% decline directly tied to truth revelation, not extraneous factors (analyst BTIG attributed decline to these events)."

It alleges a channel stuffing scheme where Defendants forced Tier 1 customers (e.g., ZF Group, Valeo, Aptiv, Magna, generating ~70% of revenue) into annual minimum quantity commitments for EyeQ chips (90% of revenue), shipping 6-7 million excess units (4-5 million in 2021-2022, 2-3 million in 2023) beyond true market demand despite customer objections and industry-standard EDI communications revealing declining OEM demand, enabling Mobileye to meet guidance/analyst expectations while concealing revenue cannibalization. Key facts include corroborated former employee accounts (FE1 from Aptiv, FE2 from Mobileye), year-end shipment spikes, Defendants' false assurances of demand visibility/inventory monitoring/shipments tied to 'market conditions'/customer 'capacity,' and inflated ADAS market share claims. Corrective disclosures on January 4, 2024 (excess inventory revelation, 50% Q1 2024 revenue drop guidance) caused 24.5% stock drop; August 1, 2024 (further guidance cut tied to EyeQ volumes/China residuals) caused 22.5% drop (total ~70% decline).

Raja, former Chief Commercial Officer) alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that from July 20, 2023 through May 28, 2024 (the 'Class Period'), defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the success of American's 'Modern Retailing' distribution strategy, which involved transitioning from traditional EDIFACT channels (used by travel agencies and corporate customers) to NDC (New Distribution Capability) technology and direct booking channels. According to the complaint, defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that this aggressive shift was actually driving away travel agencies, corporate customers, and small-to-medium businesses to competitors, resulting in significant market share losses and revenue declines. The complaint alleges defendants made false statements about strong business travel demand, successful NDC adoption, and positive corporate customer responses, while concealing that bookings from agencies declined 15% year-over-year, corporate bookings fell even more dramatically, and American was losing market share to Delta and United. The complaint further alleges that on May 28-29, 2024, defendants revealed the truth by announcing Raja's departure, slashing Q2 2024 guidance, and admitting the distribution strategy changes had driven customers away and caused approximately $750 million in revenue losses in the first half of 2024. Upon these disclosures, American's stock fell 13.54% in a single day (from $13.44 to $11.62 per share) while competitors' stocks remained relatively stable. The class period encompasses all purchasers of American securities between July 20, 2023 and May 28, 2024. Plaintiffs seek damages for securities purchased at artificially inflated prices, alleging loss causation based on the dramatic stock price decline following corrective disclosures and the divergence from competitor performance.",

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "reasoning": "The complaint adequately pleads a Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim under the heightened pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). First, materiality is satisfied: the complaint alleges defendants made specific false statements regarding (1) the success of NDC adoption by travel agencies and corporate customers; (2) strong and durable business travel demand; (3) positive corporate customer responses; and (4) American's ability to meet full-year 2024 financial guidance. These statements directly concerned American's core revenue-generating distribution channels (approximately $14 billion annually through traditional channels, roughly 29% of passenger revenue). The complaint provides detailed factual support through confidential witnesses (CW1 and CW2) employed in American's sales divisions who had direct knowledge of booking metrics, market share data, and customer reactions. The complaint alleges defendants possessed access to SalesLink Insights, PRISM reports, and IATA data showing declining bookings and market share losses beginning as early as April 2023 and continuing through the Class Period. Second, scienter is adequately pleaded with a 'strong inference' under Tellabs standards. The complaint alleges: (a) defendants received detailed internal reports showing 15% declines in agency bookings and even steeper corporate booking declines following the July 2023 contract changes; (b) defendants hired Bain & Company weeks before May 28, 2024 to conduct a 'critical review' of the distribution strategy, suggesting awareness of problems; (c) defendants knew by Q1 2024 that American was underperforming peers on revenue but hoped the situation would 'reverse itself' rather than disclose the issues; (d) defendants made granular statements about NDC adoption rates and corporate recovery percentages, indicating close monitoring of metrics that contradicted their public statements; (e) defendants' own post-Class Period admissions (May 29, 2024 Bernstein Conference and July 25, 2024 earnings call) that the strategy had been 'driving customers away' and caused $750 million in revenue losses over six months, with Isom stating 'we move[d] faster than we should have and we didn't execute well'; and (f) the magnitude of the revenue impact ($750 million) strains credulity that defendants were unaware during the Class Period. While defendants could theoretically argue they recklessly disregarded rather than knowingly made false statements, the complaint adequately alleges facts supporting knowledge or at minimum recklessness. Third, the complaint adequately alleges loss causation. It identifies specific corrective disclosures on May 28-29, 2024 (Raja's departure announcement, guidance reductions, and Isom's admissions that the distribution strategy was 'driving customers away'). The stock price fell 13.54% in one day while competitors' stocks remained stable, and analyst reports attributed the decline specifically to American's distribution strategy issues rather than market-wide factors. The complaint distinguishes this from general market conditions by showing United reaffirmed guidance the same day. Fourth, reliance is adequately pleaded under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine given American's actively traded Nasdaq status, analyst following, high trading volume, and SEC reporting obligations. The motion to dismiss should be DENIED as to this claim. Defendants' arguments that statements were aspirational or forward-looking are undermined by the specific factual allegations and the PSLRA safe harbor analysis in the complaint (Section XII), which notes statements related to then-existing facts and conditions and lacked meaningful cautionary language."

The control person liability claim is adequately pleaded and should survive a motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss should be DENIED as to this claim."
