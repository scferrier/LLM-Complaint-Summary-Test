      "summary": "1. Parties: Plaintiffs: United Association National Pension Fund (UANPF) and Saskatchewan Healthcare Employees’ Pension Plan (SHEPP), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated. Defendants: Carvana Co. (“Carvana” or the “Company”), its controlling shareholder, founders, and certain officers. 2. Alleged Misconduct: Carvana and its executives orchestrated a classic pump-and-dump scheme, violating federal securities laws to artificially inflate Carvana’s stock price, enabling insiders to sell over $3.87 billion in personal holdings at inflated prices. 3. Key Facts: Carvana, founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DriveTime Automotive (“DriveTime”), went public on the NYSE in 2017. Garcia Senior, barred from NYSE-listed company employment due to a prior federal felony conviction for fraud, installed his son as CEO and maintained more than 80% voting power. Defendants needed a high company valuation to cash out personal holdings. Defendants planned and executed a scheme to inflate Carvana’s retail vehicle sales, including: (i) “frequently aquir[ing] sales that were less profitable”; (ii) abruptly escalating the number of cars purchased from customers to induce trade-ins by lowering the Company’s purchasing and verification standards, and buying “as much as was humanly possible”; (iii) launching a rapid and unsustainable nationwide expansion plan to enter over 150 new markets even though the Company lacked the necessary infrastructure to serve many of these markets; (iv) violating state title and registration laws to quickly push through sales; and (v) entering into a pass- through sales arrangement with the Garcias’ DriveTime to sell thousands of cars with no benefit to Carvana except for the boost to its reported unit sales. Simultaneously, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Carvana’s business, including its retail sales growth, gross profits per retail unit, and logistics network. Defendants’ assurances were aimed at convincing investors that Carvana’s growth was sustainable. 4. Legal Claims: Violations of federal securities laws, including §§11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act and §§10(b), 20(a), and 20(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. 5. Class Period: May 6, 2020 to November 3, 2022, inclusive, for securities class action complaint; April 20, 2022 for additional claims related to public offering.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Lead Plaintiff Glen Littleton (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel, allege the following upon information and belief, except as to those allegations concerning Plaintiff, which are alleged upon personal knowledge. Plaintiff’s information and belief is based upon, among other things, the investigation made by and through Plaintiff’s attorneys, which includes without limitation: (a) review and analysis of regulatory filings made by Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); (b) review and analysis of press releases and media reports issued and disseminated by Tesla; (c) review and analysis of pleadings and other papers filed in the civil proceedings brought by the SEC against Tesla and Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, including the complaints filed and judgments entered therein; and (d) review of other publicly available information concerning Tesla. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiff believes that substantial evidentiary support will exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery. Plaintiff, on behalf of a class of shareholders who purchased or sold Tesla securities from August 7, 2018 to August 17, 2018 (the “Class Period”) and were damaged thereby, brings this federal class action lawsuit against Defendants Tesla, Musk, and Tesla’s Board of Directors (defined below). As alleged herein, Musk and Tesla violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78j, and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5. Tesla’s Board of Directors violated Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78t. These violations caused Plaintiff and the class billions of dollars of damages for which Defendants should be held accountable. Musk co-founded Tesla and, at all relevant times, served as the company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. On August 7, 2018, at 12:48 p.m. ET, Musk tweeted the following message to over 22 million people: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Musk continued to tweet and make statements about the potential transaction including tweeting about three hours later: “Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” These statements and a later email published on August 13, 2018, created the impression to the public that it was virtually certain that Musk could take Tesla private at $420 per share, that funding for this multi-billion dollar transaction had been secured, and the only remaining contingency was a shareholder vote. In fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential investor. There was no funding secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share or any other price. Musk had discussed taking Tesla private with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund (named the “Public Investment Fund”), but those discussions were extremely preliminary. They consisted of only exploring how the fund could be involved and did not result in any firm decision on whether the fund would increase its existing 5% stake in Tesla. The statements were also false because Musk himself understood there was “a lot of uncertainty” surrounding the proposal and there were many contingencies that needed to be satisfied CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT before any transaction could be approved by Tesla stockholders. Musk had not reached any agreement as to the price per share, had not determined how the going-private transaction would be structured, had not determined whether and to what extent current shareholders would be in favor of the transaction or if Tesla’s Board of Directors would even be in favor of having a shareholder vote, had not formally retained any advisors, and had not determined whether any regulatory approvals would need to be obtained for the transaction. Musk had also not reached any agreement concerning a significant contingency raised by the Public Investment Fund—building a Tesla production facility in the Middle East. Musk knew of the uncertain and contingent nature of any going-private transaction for Tesla as well as the lack of any secured funding at $420 per share or at any other price. Yet Musk published his tweets and other statements anyway, disrupting the markets in Tesla securities such as stock and stock options, and causing billions of dollars of damage to Tesla investors. Indeed, Musk has since admitted in the fraud case brought against him by the SEC that his statements about the going-private transaction “were premised on a long series of baseless assumptions and were contrary to facts that [he] knew.” On August 17, 2018, The New York Times published an article based on a lengthy interview with Musk that reported that the Public Investment Fund had not committed to provide any cash, so funding was not “secured.” The New York Times article further disclosed that no one had seen or reviewed Musk’s August 7, 2018 tweet before he posted it indicating that no going- private transaction was imminent. That day, Tesla’s shares declined by almost 9%, erasing over $5 billion of Tesla’s market capitalization. For investors that initially believed Musk’s statements and purchased shares at artificially inflated prices in hopes that Tesla would ultimately pay $420 per share, they sustained millions of dollars in losses. Investors who were “short” Tesla stock (meaning that they were betting the stock price would decline) were also damaged. Tesla had over 170 million shares outstanding at or around August 7, 2018. The “short interest” at that point in time was 33.8 million, meaning that almost 20% of Tesla’s shareholders were betting that Tesla’s stock would decline in value. Musk’s tweet, which caused the price of Tesla’s shares to increase 11% over the course of the day, resulted in a CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT mark-to-market loss of $1.1 billion for these short investors, many of whom had to purchase Tesla shares at inflated prices to cover their positions. Option traders also suffered significant losses. Purchasers and sellers of call and put contracts, which are agreements that provide investors with either the right or the obligation to buy or sell shares at specific prices within particular periods of time, opened and closed positions at artificial prices due to the artificial inflation in Tesla’s stock price and the increased implied volatility in Tesla’s stock, resulting in damages to those investors. By misleading investors regarding the proposed going-private transaction and its funding, Musk, either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness, harmed virtually every single other person and/or entity trading Tesla securities during the Class Period. Members of Tesla’s Board of Directors also bear responsibility for the losses suffered by Tesla investors as a result of Musk and Tesla’s misrepresentations. The Board of Directors had responsibility for ensuring Tesla’s public disclosures were truthful and accurate. In November 2013, Tesla identified Musk’s Twitter account as an official channel of communication for the company. Once that occurred, Tesla’s Board of Directors were duty-bound to oversee the accuracy of statements made by Musk on his Twitter account. While Tesla’s board members issued press releases regarding the proposed going-private transaction and managed to persuade Musk from tweeting about the transaction for some of the Class Period, they did not use this control to ensure that the disinformation published by Musk was corrected until after the Class had already suffered billions of dollars in losses. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to: Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78j, and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC (17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5); and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78t. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to U.S.C. §1331 and Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78aa. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78aa and 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) because certain of the acts alleged herein, including the preparation and dissemination of material false and/or misleading information, occurred in this District. Further, Tesla’s principal executive offices are located within this District. In connection with the acts, conduct and other wrongs alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly and/or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including but not limited to, the United States mail, interstate telephone communications and the facilities of the national securities exchange. III. PARTIES Lead Plaintiff Glen Littleton purchased and sold Tesla common stock and options during the Class Period and was damaged thereby. Littleton’s certification evidencing his transactions in Tesla’s securities during the Class Period, previously filed with the Court in connection with his motion for appointment as lead plaintiff, is incorporated herein by reference (ECF No. 42-1). Defendant Tesla is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located at 3500 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, California 94304. Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems. The company’s stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA.” Other Tesla securities include stock options which are traded and quoted on exchanges including: BOX Exchange LLC; Cboe BZX Options Exchange, Inc; Cboe C2 Options Exchange, Incorporated; Cboe EDGX Options Exchange, Inc.; Cboe Options Exchange, Incorporated; Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC; MIAX PEARL, LLC; Nasdaq BX, Inc.; Nasdaq GEMX, LLC; Nasdaq ISE, LLC; Nasdaq PHLX LLC; The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; NYSE American LLC; and NYSE Arca, Inc. Defendant Musk co-founded Tesla in July 2003. In early February 2004, Musk became Tesla’s majority shareholder and joined the Board of Directors as its Chairman. By October 2008, Musk became both the Chief Executive Officer and spokesman of Tesla and has served in CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT that capacity since 2008. Musk was forced to step down as Chairman of Tesla’s Board in October in accordance with his settlement with the SEC concerning the statements at issue herein. Musk created a profile on the social media platform Twitter under the handle “@elonmusk” (twitter.com/elonmusk) in June 2009. Since that time, Musk often used Twitter to communicate about Tesla’s business. In November 2013, Tesla formally notified investors that it would use Musk’s Twitter account as a formal means of communication to convey “additional information” about the company to investors. In a current report on Form 8-K dated November 5, 2013, Tesla stated, in pertinent part, as follows: “Tesla investors and others should note that we announce material information to the public about our company, products and services and other issues through a variety of means, including Tesla’s website, press releases, SEC filings, blogs and social media, in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public. . . . For additional information, please follow Elon Musk’s and Tesla’s Twitter accounts: twitter.com/elonmusk and twitter.com/TeslaMotors.” Defendant Brad W. Buss (“Buss”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since As a member of the Board, Buss acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendant Robyn Denholm (“Denholm”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2014 and was appointed to chair the Board on November 7, 2018. As a member of the Board, Denholm acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendant Ira Ehrenpreis (“Ehrenpreis”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2007. As a member of the Board, Ehrenpreis acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendant Antonio J. Gracias (“Gracias”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2007 and has served as Tesla’s Lead Independent Director since 2010. As a member of the Board, Gracias acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendant James Murdoch (“Murdoch”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2017. As a member of the Board, Murdoch acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendant Kimbal Musk has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2004. As a member of the Board, Kimbal Musk acted as a controlling person of Tesla. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Defendant Linda Johnson Rice (“Rice”) has served as a director of Tesla’s Board since 2017. As a member of the Board, Rice acted as a controlling person of Tesla. Defendants Buss, Denholm, Ehrenpreis, Gracias, Murdoch, Kimbal, and Rice are collectively referred to as the “Board.” IV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of all individuals and entities who purchased or sold Tesla stock, options, and other securities during the Class Period and were damaged thereby, excluding Tesla, Musk, the Board, and each Defendant’s immediate family members, legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which Tesla, Musk, or the Board have or had a controlling interest (the “Class”). The Class members are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Throughout the Class Period, Tesla’s securities were actively traded on the NASDAQ. While the exact number of Class members is unknown to Plaintiff at this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate discovery, Plaintiff believes that there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Class members. Record owners and other Class members may be identified from records maintained by Tesla or its transfer agent and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail, using the form of notice similar to that customarily used in securities class actions. At all relevant times herein, there were over 170 million shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding and hundreds of millions of dollars of other securities traded. Upon information and belief, these shares and option contracts were held by thousands of individuals located geographically throughout the country and the world. Joinder would be highly impracticable. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the Class members as all Class members were similarly affected by the Defendants’ wrongful conduct in violation of the federal securities laws complained of herein. Plaintiff bought and sold common stock and option contracts during the Class Period. The manner in which Plaintiff sustained damages in connection with each security that he held was similar, if not identical, to other Class members who purchased or sold Tesla securities. Plaintiff has and will continue to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Class members. Plaintiff has retained counsel competent and experienced in class and securities litigation. Plaintiff has no interests antagonistic to or in conflict with those of the Class. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class members and predominate over any questions solely affecting individual Class members. Among the questions of law and fact common to the Class are: (a) whether the federal securities laws were violated by Defendants’ respective acts as alleged herein; (b) whether Defendants acted knowingly or with deliberate recklessness in issuing false and misleading statements concerning a proposed going-private transaction and its financing; (c) whether the price of Tesla’s securities during the Class Period were affected by Defendants’ conduct complained of herein; and (d) whether the Class members have sustained damages and, if so, what is the proper measure of damages. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is impracticable. Furthermore, as the damages suffered by individual Class members may be relatively small, the expense and burden of individual litigation make it impossible for Class members to individually redress the wrongs done to them. There will be no difficulty in the management of this action as a class action. Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles. These vehicles consist primarily of three models: the Model S luxury sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle, and the Model 3 mass market sedan. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Both the Model S and Model X had experienced production difficulties after being introduced in 2012 and 2015, respectively. As the Model 3 vehicle was to be produced in greater numbers, analysts and investors closely followed Tesla’s production plans for it. On October 2, 2017, Tesla issued a press release stating that “Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.” Despite promising to deliver 1,600 Model vehicles in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it had produced only 220 of the vehicles. Musk had previously promised on February 22, 2017 that Tesla would be producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017. On November 1, 2017, in an “Update Letter” posted to its website, Tesla revealed that its manufacturing problems during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 had resulted in heavy spending in an effort to increase production. The spending resulted in wider-than-expected losses— $2.92 per share compared to the analyst consensus of $2.29 per share—and a sharp decline in the price of Tesla’s common stock from $331.53 per share to $321.08 per share. Notwithstanding its production problems, Tesla told shareholders in the November 1, 2017 “Update Letter” that it expected to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week late in the first quarter of 2018. On January 3, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that Tesla’s problems with battery production at its “Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada (where Tesla produces lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles), were worse than it had acknowledged and likely to cause further delays and quality issues for the new Model 3 vehicles. The continued production problems led Tesla to revise its previously stated production targets in a press release dated January 3, 2018. From 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Tesla told investors that it was aiming for 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of March, ramping up to 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by June. On January 25, 2018, investors received additional information about Tesla’s Model production problems when CNBC reported that Tesla’s Model 3 vehicle production was being hampered in part due to the fact that the company was still making its Model 3 vehicle batteries CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT partly by hand and having to “borrow” scores of employees from Panasonic, which is a partner in the Gigafactory and supplies lithium-ion battery cells, to help with this manual assembly. Numerous short investors had targeted Tesla by this point in time. For example, CNBC reported in its January 25, 2018 article that Stanphyl Capital’s Mark B. Spiegel had taken a “significant short position in the company.” Spiegel told CNBC, in pertinent part, that: “While I’ve no doubt that Tesla will eventually work out its Model 3 vehicle production problems, the base model will cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build. The company will never deliver more than a token few for less than the current $49,000 lowest-cost offering. Sales will hugely disappoint relative to expectations of over 400,000 a year. And even at those higher prices Tesla will never come anywhere close to its promised [profitability].”"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, as Trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, (“Plaintiff”) individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, by and through his attorneys, alleges the following upon information and belief, except as to those allegations concerning Plaintiff, which are alleged upon personal knowledge. Plaintiff’s information and belief is based upon, among other things, his counsel’s investigation, which includes without limitation: (a) review and analysis of regulatory filings made by Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix” or the “Company”) with the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); (b) review and analysis of press releases and media reports issued by and disseminated by Netflix; and (c) review of other publicly available information concerning Netflix. 1. This is a class action on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Netflix common stock or call options, or sold put options, between January 19, 2021 and April 19, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Plaintiff pursues claims against the Defendants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). 2. Netflix is an entertainment company that primarily operates a streaming platform that offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games across a variety of genres and languages in over 190 countries. It has one operating segment that derives revenues from monthly membership fees for streaming services. While its competitors earned revenue from advertising on their platforms or offering an ad-free plan, Netflix proudly remained free of advertising, so its revenue growth depended entirely on increasing membership. 3. Indeed, though Netflix measured the health of its business using acquisition, retention, and engagement metrics, the one metric that was the critical focus to investors was “paid net adds,” which is the number of paid new memberships added during the reporting period minus those lost due to cancellations. 4. While the Company offered plans to allow for multiple simultaneous streams within a household, Netflix prohibited its paying members from sharing their password with non-paying users who did not reside in their household, which is called “account sharing” or “password sharing.” At all relevant times, the Company acknowledged that account sharing existed but did not AMENDED COMPLAINT disclose any data concerning the extent of that account sharing. For years, Netflix management maintained a very permissive approach toward account sharing, claiming that sharing was not a significant problem and even a positive for the Company. In 2016, then-CFO David Wells publicly stated that account sharing was not “a material inhibitor to [Netflix’s] growth,” but acknowledged “[t]hat might not be true forever.” 5. The first indication of a possible shift in Netflix’s posture toward account sharing occurred in 2019, when media reported that Netflix had employed software by Synamedia “to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services.” Reportedly, the software could identify when a non-paying user logs into an account based on the viewing and location habits of paying members. Netflix did not publicly acknowledge using Synamedia’s software, but management admitted that they “continue[d] to monitor” account sharing during an earnings call in October 2019. 6. Any plans to crack down on account sharing, however, were tabled during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. As mandated lockdowns confined people to their homes, the demand for streaming entertainment services grew and Netflix experienced a surge in paid net adds. According to a former Netflix employee, an internal memo in approximately Q2’20 stated that the Company would not attempt to limit account sharing once the pandemic struck because it could be seen as exploiting the global pandemic, at a time when people were already losing so much (e.g., health, jobs, housing), and the priority was to make the service available without interruption. 7. According to management’s public statements, the COVID-related surge in subscribers led to “a pull forward” of Netflix’s membership growth from subsequent quarters. Indeed, Netflix posted impressive results during the first half of 2020, with 15 million paid net adds in Q1’20 and 10 million paid net adds in Q2’20. Defendants predicted that the second half of 2020 would be “light” relative to prior years, and, though Q1’21 would experience some residual effect from the COVID pull-forward, this effect would “wash out” and not be “permanent or long term.” 8. The Class Period begins on January 19, 2021 when Netflix announced its financial results for Q4’20 and issued underwhelming guidance for paid net adds in Q1’21. Because Netflix had outperformed expectations for Q4’20, an analyst questioned whether the lower-than-expected guidance reflected an undisclosed weakness. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Spencer AMENDED COMPLAINT Neumann, responded that “there’s probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021,” but flatly rejected the analyst’s contention that Netflix was saturated in the United States and Canada (“UCAN”) market. Neumann assured that in the UCAN market, Netflix was “roughly 60% penetrated, and . . . still growing.”1 The promise of continued growth in the UCAN market was enticing to investors because it was the Company’s most tenured market, providing the highest average revenue per member and contributing most to Netflix’s revenues. More broadly, Neumann claimed that “we’ve got a lot of headroom in all these markets” in which Netflix offered its streaming services to consumers. 9. Notwithstanding Neumann’s representation that Netflix was only 60% penetrated into the UCAN market, the actual rate of market penetration was substantially higher due to account sharing. In addition to the roughly 74 million UCAN subscribers that Netflix reported at the time of Neumann’s statements, unbeknownst to investors, there were almost 30 million additional households that were using Netflix’s services without paying for them through account sharing. This amount vastly exceeded any of the public estimates of account sharing that had been circulated by third parties. The effective rate of market penetration in the UCAN market, therefore, was roughly 83%, making it extremely difficult for Netflix to materially increase its subscriber base. Globally, Netflix was significantly less penetrated than in the UCAN market, but extensive account sharing still caused a degree of market penetration that was substantially larger than investors had been led to believe. As detailed infra, Netflix reported roughly 204 million global subscribers as of the end of Q4’20, implying a global market penetration of roughly 24%, but Netflix failed to disclose that there were more than 90 million additional households that used Netflix’s services through account sharing. The effective degree of market penetration, therefore, was around 35%. Reaching higher levels of penetration outside UCAN, and thus globally, would require the Company to expand its library of local content for those markets, which was a longer-term prospect. Thus, while there was still “headroom” to grow, Netflix was a lot closer to the ceiling of its potential growth than anyone in the market had reason to believe. 1 Unless otherwise noted, all emphasis in this Complaint has been added. AMENDED COMPLAINT 10. In March 2021, media reports indicated that some Netflix users were seeing the following warning: “If you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.” In the following days, analysts issued reports estimating that between 26% and 33% of Netflix subscribers shared their account. Even the worst-case estimates, however, substantially underestimated the degree of account sharing that Netflix was experiencing. 11. When asked why Netflix was testing methods to limit account sharing and why this was “right time to start tightening the screws” on this long-standing issue, Defendants claimed that the testing was not “new” but part of Netflix’s continuing approach to offer plans that meet the broad sets of needs of its members. Specifically, during the April 20, 2021 Q1’21 earnings call, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer Gregory Peters stated that Netflix is “really seeking that sort of flexible approach to make sure that we are providing the plans with the right features and the right price points,” and while the Company wanted to ensure that only paying members use the service, the testing was “not necessarily a new thing” and “[w]e’ve been doing this for a while.” 12. Over the next several quarters, Defendants claimed that “the underlying business metrics are really healthy,” and any weakness was attributable to “choppiness” caused by the COVID pull-forward. Even when acknowledging that the UCAN and the Latin American regions “grew paid memberships more slowly” because “[t]hese regions have higher penetration,” Defendants assured there was still “ample runway for growth.” 13. The truth began to emerge on January 20, 2022, after the market closed, when Netflix released its financial results for Q4’21. On that date, Netflix announced that it had missed its guidance for paid net adds in Q4’21 by 200,000 subscribers and that it only expected 2.5 million paid net adds in Q1’22 (compared to 4 million during the comparable period a year ago). Defendants attributed the shortfall to “the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship,” revealing that “acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels.” 14. On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $110.75, or 21.7%, to close at $397.50 per share on January 21, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume. This drop wiped out approximately $49 billion of market capitalization in one day. 15. Analysts were alarmed that the weak Q1’22 guidance reflected undisclosed AMENDED COMPLAINT underlying problems, but Defendants continued to issue materially false and/or misleading statements. During the January 20, 2022 Q4’21 earnings call, an analyst specifically asked whether management had “any concerns . . . about anything structural, whether it’s competition or saturation.” Neumann posited that “[i]t’s tough to say exactly why our acquisition hasn’t kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels” but attested that there was “[n]o structural change in the business.” Co-Chief Executive Officer (“Co-CEO”) Reed Hastings also dismissed concerns, stating that “COVID has introduced so much noise.” Co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly cited “bumpiness” caused by the COVID pull-forward as affecting predictions and stated that “all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.” 16. The truth was revealed on April 19, 2022, after the market closed, when the Company admitted to the true extent of account sharing and acknowledged that account sharing caused Netflix to be highly penetrated in the applicable markets, thereby inhibiting subscriber growth. Specifically, Netflix stated that “in addition to our 222m paying households, we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region.” Moreover, “our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts – combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.” Excluding the impact of a service suspension in Russia, Q1’22 paid net adds totaled 0.5 million, significantly missing guidance of 2.5 million. 17. The market was shocked. Analysts expressed astonishment at the extent of the account sharing and the degree of market saturation that the Company had now admitted to, and what those facts meant about the Company’s future prospects. For example, J.P. Morgan issued a report stating that the Q1’21 results represented “a sea change quarter for NFLX in which the company essentially conceded to every key point of the bear thesis[.]” Beyond the disappointing quarterly results themselves, J.P. Morgan observed that “the bigger factor is management’s acknowledgement of relatively high household penetration when including account sharing[.]” Similarly, Bank of America stated, “Management now concedes that between paying subscribers and password sharers, most of the key markets, UCAN and EMEA likely, have saturated and it will be very hard to find new many subscribers in these markets in the near to medium term.” Analyst AMENDED COMPLAINT Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson LLC said, “Everything they’ve tried to convince me of over the last five years was given up in one quarter. It’s such [an] about face.” 18. Following Netflix’s April 19, 2022 disclosures, the Company’s share price fell $122.42, or over 35%, to close at $226.19 per share on April 20, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume, wiping out approximately $54 billion in market capitalization. 19. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors, inter alia: (1) that during the Class Period, between 91 million and 100+ million households were using Netflix globally through account sharing without paying Netflix for its services; (2) that during the Class Period, between 29 million and 30+ million households were using Netflix in the UCAN region without paying Netflix for its services; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Netflix was substantially more penetrated in the applicable markets than investors were led to believe by Netflix’s reported subscriber data and public statements concerning market penetration; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Netflix’s ability to acquire new paying members was severely hindered. 20. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 21. The claims asserted herein arise under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC (17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5). 22. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78aa). 23. Venue is proper in this Judicial District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78aa(c)). Substantial acts in furtherance of the alleged fraud or the effects of the fraud have occurred in this Judicial District. Many of the acts charged herein, including the dissemination of materially false and/or misleading information, occurred in AMENDED COMPLAINT substantial part in this Judicial District. In addition, the Company’s principal executive offices are located in this District. 24. In connection with the acts, transactions, and conduct alleged herein, Defendants directly and indirectly used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including the United States mail, interstate telephone communications, and the facilities of a national securities exchange. III. PARTIES 25. Plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, as Trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, as set forth in the previously-filed certification (ECF No. 1 at 21-23) and declaration (ECF No. 19-4), incorporated by reference herein, purchased or otherwise acquired Netflix common stock or call options, or sold Netflix put options, during the Class Period, and suffered damages as a result of the federal securities law violations and false and/or misleading statements and/or material omissions alleged herein. 26. Defendant Netflix is incorporated under the laws of Delaware with its principal executive offices located in Los Gatos, California. Netflix’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “NFLX.” 27. Defendant Reed Hastings (“Hastings”) is the co-founder of Netflix and served as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) from 1997 until July 2020, Co-Chief Executive Officer (“Co- CEO”) since July 2020, and President of the Company and Chairperson of the Board of Directors since 1997. In 1991, Hastings founded Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software in 1997. Hastings served on the board of Facebook, Inc. from 2011-2019. Hastings received a B.A. from Bowdoin College in 1983, and an MSCS in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University in 28. Defendant Ted Sarandos (“Sarandos”) served as the Co-CEO since July 2020, Chief Content Creator since 2000, and a director of the Company since 2020. Sarandos also serves on the Film Advisory Board for the Tribeca and Los Angeles Film Festivals, is an American Cinematheque board member, and serves on the Board of Spotify Technology S.A. Sarandos previously served as Vice President of Product and Merchandising at Video City/West Coast video and Western Regional Director of Sales and Operations at video distributor ETD. AMENDED COMPLAINT 29. Defendant Spencer Neumann (“Neumann”) served as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) since January 2019. Previously, he served as Activision Blizzard’s CFO from May 2017. Prior to that, Neumann held a number of positions of increasing responsibility at The Walt Disney Company, most recently serving as the CFO and executive vice president of Global Guest Experience of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, from 2012 to 2017. From 2005 to 2012, Neumann worked at the private equity firms of Providence Equity Partners and Summit Partners. Prior to that, he held several other roles with Disney, which he initially joined in 1992, including executive vice president of the ABC Television Network from 2001 to 2004 and CFO of the Walt Disney Internet Group from 1999 to 2001. Neumann holds both a B.A. degree in economics and an M.B.A. degree from Harvard University. 30. Defendant Gregory Peters (“Peters”) served as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer since July 2020 and Chief Product Officer since 2017, and served in a variety of others positions at Netflix since 2008. He is on the Board of Directors of Door Dash and 2U, Inc. Prior to joining Netflix, Peters was Senior Vice President of consumer electronics products for Macrovision Solutions Corp. (later renamed to Rovi Corporation) and held positions at digital entertainment software provider, Mediabolic Inc., Red Hat Network, the provider of Linux and Open Source technology, and online vendor Wine.com. He holds a degree in physics and astronomy from Yale University. 31. Defendants Hastings, Sarandos, Neumann, and Peters (collectively the “Individual Defendants”), because of their positions with the Company, possessed the power and authority to control the contents of the Company’s reports to the SEC, press releases and presentations to securities analysts, money and portfolio managers and institutional investors, i.e., the market. The Individual Defendants were provided with copies of the Company’s reports and press releases alleged herein to be misleading prior to, or shortly after, their issuance and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or cause them to be corrected. Because of their positions and access to material non-public information available to them, the Individual Defendants knew that the adverse facts specified herein had not been disclosed to, and were being concealed from, the public, and that the positive representations which were being made were then materially false AMENDED COMPLAINT and/or misleading.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This consolidated class action complaint alleges (i) strict liability and negligence claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), and (ii) fraud claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). 2. These claims arise from Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions about the Talis One, a molecular diagnostic device that Defendants hastily attempted to develop and market for COVID-19 testing. Defendants claimed that the Talis One would enable highly accurate testing at the point of care (e.g., in a doctor’s office), in contrast to central laboratory testing that could take days to receive results. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI 3. As detailed below, this case is not about the risks of a development-stage company or Defendants’ failure to predict the future. Rather, at the time of Talis’s February 11, 2021 initial public offering (the “IPO”), Talis had no functioning product, no viable path to commercialization, and had already experienced significant regulatory and technical problems that foreclosed or dramatically delayed the Talis One’s commercial launch. Specifically, Talis had already botched its crucial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) application for Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”); the Talis One had unresolved design issues and suffered high invalid rates (i.e., tests that do not yield usable results); and Talis did not have the ability to manufacture the Talis One at scale or even a realistic timeline for doing so. 4. These existing, adverse facts were concealed in the Registration Statement, which instead touted positive test results and falsely claimed the Talis One was “highly accurate,” that Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” for delivery, and that “automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month” were expected to “scale to full capacity through 2021.” These false and misleading statements—and Defendants’ separately actionable omissions of material, known uncertainties and risks in violation of SEC disclosure requirements—painted a materially false picture of Talis’s business, operations, and prospects. 5. Talis originally focused on developing the Talis One for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In 2020, in a rush to capitalize on the COVID-19 pandemic, Talis abandoned its prior efforts and began to develop a COVID-19 test for the Talis One. In January 2021, Talis applied to the FDA for an EUA for the Talis One COVID-19 test—the initial step in commercialization. At the time, the FDA had only authorized the first COVID-19 vaccines on an emergency basis in December 2020. With a U.S. population that was still largely unvaccinated, this environment created economic opportunity for new manufacturers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Because several such tests were already on the market, however, investors were keenly focused on a new entrant’s ability to quickly procure an EUA from the FDA; the accuracy and reliability of its product; and its ability to manufacture its product at scale. 6. On each point, the Registration Statement for the IPO contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions that concealed the adverse facts existing at the time. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI 7. First, immediately before the IPO, Talis made an EUA submission to the FDA. Unknown to investors, this submission used a benchmark comparator assay that lacked sufficient sensitivity to support the submission under FDA standards. The comparator assay is a third-party COVID-19 test that was used as a benchmark of the relative performance of the Talis One. Because such analysis is comparative, the comparator assay’s sensitivity—its ability to reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus—is key. As a former Talis senior scientist has stated, however, Talis used a weak comparator assay for its submission (FE-2). Indeed, while FDA guidance requires a “high sensitivity” comparator assay, Talis chose an insufficiently sensitive comparator assay: a COVID-19 test that generated “false negative” results with unacceptable frequency. Based on this deceptive benchmark, Talis reported unreliable data to the FDA. 8. Nonetheless, the Registration Statement misleadingly touted granular details of test data and results, claimed that the Talis One displayed “high PPA and NPA,” which were “suggestive of clinical sensitivity and specificity,” and stated that Talis had used “FDA- authorized” comparator tests. These statements were misleading when made because they omitted the most important fact: Talis had used a comparator assay that was insufficiently sensitive and did not comply with FDA guidance, and as a result, Talis’s EUA submission was doomed from inception. 9. The FDA quickly requested additional information from Talis, but Defendants conducted the IPO on February 11, 2021 and raised $254 million before responding and without disclosing any details about the FDA’s request. Just days after the IPO, the FDA formally rejected Talis’s flawed comparator assay, forcing Talis to withdraw its EUA submission. 10. Second, before the IPO, the Talis One had serious quality and design issues, including high invalid rates. Nonetheless, the Registration Statement misleadingly touted the Talis One as a “highly accurate” product with safety and convenience features, and misleadingly stated that Talis’s “diagnostic tests may contain errors or defects or be subject to reliability issues” when such issues had already arisen. 11. Third, before the IPO, Talis’s manufacturing efforts were already severely delayed, and Talis had failed to meet its own internal deadlines. Despite significant, existing manufacturing CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI delays, the Registration Statement misleadingly claimed that the Talis One was designed to be “low-cost and manufactured at scale” and touted Talis’s investment in automated cartridge production lines that would purportedly “scale to full capacity” of one million cartridges per month “through 2021.” Further, the Registration Statement falsely stated that Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” to be delivered by Q1 2021; in reality, Talis had merely ordered “components for up to 5,000 instruments,” a materially different fact that Talis revealed over a year later. 12. On February 11, 2021, Talis conducted its IPO, issuing 15,870,000 shares at a price of $16/share and raising $254 million, largely from the Class. Shortly thereafter, in late February 2021, the FDA rejected the insufficiently sensitive comparator assay used in Talis’s EUA submission—a fact Talis continued to conceal for over a week. When Talis publicly revealed the FDA’s rejection on March 8, 2021 and disclosed that it had withdrawn its EUA submission, the Company’s inflated share price began to collapse. 13. As concerns mounted over Talis’s inability to secure an EUA and begin timely production, Talis’s senior management continued to mislead the market in an attempt to preserve the positive façade that had enabled Talis to conduct the IPO. In May 2021, Talis’s CEO, Defendant Brian Coe, falsely assured investors on a public conference call that Talis was ready to begin production of the Talis One “in a very timely manner” once EUA approval was granted, and was “very much ready to go.” 14. These positive public statements, according to a former Talis engineer (FE-1), had no basis. Internally, the Company was in complete disarray: internal schedules were unmet and the Talis One suffered from serious and unresolved design and manufacturing issues that continue to foreclose commercial production today. Nonetheless, CEO Coe—while knowing of the Talis One’s high invalid rates and manufacturing delays—continued to tout purported progress, claiming in August 2021 that “our results really look terrific.” Even by September 2021, a former associate director of technical implementation (FE-5) confirmed that Talis was not ready to begin manufacturing as soon as the EUA was received. 15. Further, in an effort to create the appearance of commercial activity, Talis sales representatives were instructed to engage in aggressive pre-selling of the Talis One before the FDA CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI granted an EUA. Under enormous pressure, including threats of termination, Talis’s sales force ultimately obtained 140 presales. The executives took the sales, put them in a spreadsheet, then told Talis’s Board they had substantial presales. Yet the Talis One remained little more than a “dummy box” that sales representatives were instructed not to turn on in meetings at doctors’ offices and hospitals, as a former Talis territory account manager (FE-4) confirmed. Indeed, on or around November 12, 2021, the former account manager turned on the device and it said “invalid, invalid, invalid” 20 or 30 times. 16. As time continued to pass with no functioning product on the market, Talis’s share price plummeted. In August 2021, CEO Coe (who had presided over the failed EUA application and IPO) was terminated. 17. Coe’s replacement as CEO, Brian Blaser, served for only a week before abruptly resigning in December 2021; the former account manager (FE-4) was told that Blaser quickly departed Talis because there was major fraud. 18. In a March 2022 earnings call, Talis refused to provide any timeline for launching the Talis One and admitted that its “current manufacturing process is not yet sufficient to support commercialization.” 19. Finally, in May 2022, Talis disclosed that it still has no timeline for launch and does not expect the Talis One to make any “significant revenue contribution” in 2022. 20. Nearly 17 months after Talis’s February 2021 IPO, Talis still has no commercially available product. The following chart shows the price of Talis common stock, which peaked at $27.80 and closed at $0.81 on June 30, 2022, a 95% decline from its IPO price of $16.00/share: CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 21. The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 77K and 77o) and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a)), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10b-5 (17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5). 22. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. § 77v) and Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78aa). In addition, because this is a civil action arising under the laws of the United States, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 23. In connection with the acts alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including but not limited to the mails, interstate telephone communications, and the facilities of a national securities exchange. 24. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Many of the acts and transactions giving rise to the violations of law complained of herein occurred in this District. In addition, Talis maintained its corporate headquarters and principal executive offices in this District throughout the Class Period. III. BACKGROUND ALLEGATIONS 25. The allegations in this Complaint are based on Co-Lead Counsel’s investigation, which included interviews with former Talis employees who have provided information supporting Lead Plaintiffs’ allegations (the “FEs”). The FEs provided information on a confidential basis and are described in Section V.C.a. below by job description, title, responsibility, and period of employment, thereby providing sufficient detail to establish their reliability and personal knowledge. Allegations attributed to a particular FE are referenced by the employee’s “FE __” designation or job description. Talis Originally Focuses on Diagnostics for Sexually Transmitted Infections Talis has yet to successfully launch any product of its own or generate any revenue from a product it has developed. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI 27. Talis was founded in 2010 as SlipChip LLC by Defendants Coe and Ismagilov to develop point-of-care (“POC”) diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. (POC testing refers to medical diagnostic testing that takes place at or near the time and place of patient care, rather than in a central laboratory.) 28. In February of 2018, SlipChip changed its name to Talis Biomedical and established headquarters in Menlo Park, California. At this point, Talis was developing rapid POC diagnostic tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Talis Abruptly Pivots to Capitalize on the COVID-19 Pandemic The first cases of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were identified in China in December 2019. By mid-January 2020, the virus was detected in multiple countries, including the United States, which confirmed its first case on January 20, 2020. On February 4, 2020, the United States Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services determined, pursuant to Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&CA”), that there was a public health emergency with a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and the United States declared a national emergency shortly thereafter. The rapid spread of COVID-19 created an urgent need for reliable tests. For example, on April 17, 2020, a former American Medical Association President wrote that “[i]t is critically important that we dramatically expand our testing capacity, both diagnostic and antibody testing. Only through that expansion will we have the data and information necessary for public health officials to determine when it is safe to resume a semi-normal way of life.” By summer 2020, Talis abandoned its original focus on STI testing and started to develop a molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19. There are two basic types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Antigen tests (like those widely available at drugstores) detect specific viral proteins (antigens), but provide only a simple “yes” or “no” and sacrifice accuracy for speed. By contrast, molecular diagnostic tests amplify genetic material to detect viral nucleic acid (viral RNA), offering greater accuracy but generally lower speed than antigen tests. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI 33. On July 31, 2020, Talis issued a press release titled “Talis Awarded NIH RADx Contract to Launch Talis One™ System for Point-of-Care COVID-19 Testing and Further Strengthens Financial Position and Leadership Team,” declaring that the Company had been awarded a $25 million National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) contract through the NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (“RADx”) initiative (the “RADx Contract”). The press release proclaimed that the RADx Contract and $100M in new, private financing would allow the Company to “scale manufacturing” for the launch of the Talis One diagnostic platform, which purportedly would provide “rapid and highly accurate detection of COVID-19 at the point-of- care.” 34. Talis’s press release included an image of the Talis One platform, comprised of a box-shaped analyzer device and a consumable cartridge to contain the sample for testing: In contrast to cumbersome and time-intensive central lab testing, Talis claimed that the Talis One platform was “designed to be operated by untrained personnel and incorporate safety and convenience features, including automated cartridge-based sample preparation for reliable results, closed cartridges to mitigate contamination, room-temperature cartridge storage for convenient storage, and cloud connectivity for easily accessed results and records.” CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI Defendants Go All Out in the Build-Up to the IPO, Ignoring Problems with the Talis One EUA Submission, Manufacturing, and Invalid Rates 36. By late 2020, Defendants’ plan was to take Talis public and secure additional funding through an IPO. FE-1, a former Talis senior engineer, described the Company moving to rapidly conduct an IPO.1 Unfortunately, as FE-1 explained, Talis was a few years behind in technical development, and its response was to throw money at the problem. 37. Defendants’ haste was largely driven by two factors: 38. First, Talis nearly ran out of cash and was forced to issue a “going concern” warning, meaning that it was probable that Talis would become insolvent within the next year. Talis’s first draft registration statement (confidentially filed with the SEC on October 15, 2020) explained that “Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” 39. Under FASB ASU No. 2014-15, “[s]ubstantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).” While Talis temporarily staved off its auditor’s “going concern” warning by raising $126 million in private financing in November 2020, the Company still needed more capital. 40. Second, Talis sought to capitalize on a temporary—and rapidly closing—window to get a COVID-19 test to market and quickly achieve sales before demand for testing began to cool. In this regard, timing was crucial to investors and analysts given that FDA had recently authorized the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. Further, several competing COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests were already on the market by late 2020. 1 Each FE’s role, tenure at the Company, and statements are further described in Section V.C.a. CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 3:22-CV-00105-SI 41. Talis’s survival, let alone its value as a public company, was thus wholly dependent on its ability to quickly produce and sell the Talis One. This would enable Talis to create a large installed base for consumable cartridges and additional, non-COVID-19 assays to generate revenues and profits after COVID-19. Further, to succeed as a relatively late entrant in a crowded field, Talis would need to demonstrate an accurate, reliable product that could be manufactured at scale. 42. As detailed below, however, by early 2021, Talis had no"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Court-appointed Lead Plaintiff Sjunde AP-Fonden (“AP7” or “Lead Plaintiff”), by and through counsel, brings this federal securities action individually and on behalf of a class (“Class”) consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of Lucid Group, Inc. (“Lucid” or the “Company”) between November 15, 2021, and August 3, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were damaged thereby. Lead Plaintiff asserts claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), respectively, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, against Defendants (defined below). Lead Plaintiff alleges the following based upon personal knowledge as to itself and its own acts, and upon information and belief as to all other matters. Lead Plaintiff’s information and belief are based on the ongoing investigation of its undersigned counsel. This investigation includes review and analysis of, among other things: (i) Lucid’s filings with the SEC; (ii) transcripts of Lucid’s conference calls with analysts and investors; (iii) Company presentations, press releases, and reports; (iv) research reports by securities and financial analysts; (v) news and media reports concerning Lucid and other facts related to this action; (vi) price and volume data for Lucid’s securities; and (vii) information provided by former Lucid employees and contractors. Lead Counsel’s investigation into the factual allegations continues, and many of the relevant facts are known only by Defendants or are exclusively within their custody or control. Lead Plaintiff believes that substantial additional evidentiary support is likely to exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery. 1. This securities fraud class action arises from Defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions about Lucid’s production of the Company’s only commercially-available electric vehicle (“EV”), the Lucid Air (the “Air”), and the factors impacting that production. 2. At all times, Defendants concealed the severe, internal, Company-specific problems that were actually slowing production, including internal logistics issues, design flaws, and the key drivers of parts shortages. Instead, Defendants blamed Lucid’s woes on the purported impact of external, industry- wide supply chain problems and repeatedly assured investors that the Company was “mitigating” that CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS global impact. These misrepresentations left investors with a materially false and misleading impression about Lucid’s actual production and internal ability and readiness to mass produce its vehicles. Against that backdrop, Defendants then lied, time and again, about the number of vehicles Lucid would produce. When the relevant truth about Lucid’s disastrous internal logistics and production issues was finally revealed to the market over two partial corrective disclosures, Lucid’s common stock price cratered, causing substantial damage to the Company’s investors. 3. Defendant Lucid designs, produces, and sells luxury EVs. The Company evolved from a startup called Atieva, Inc. (“Atieva”), which initially produced and sold EV batteries and electric powertrains to EV companies. In 2013, Atieva decided to shift its business model and produce its own EVs. To spearhead the transformation, Atieva hired industry-veteran Peter Rawlinson (“Rawlinson”), who had overseen the development of Tesla, Inc.’s (“Tesla”) Model S from 2009 to 2012. 4. Atieva changed its name to Lucid in 2016. That same year, the Company unveiled a prototype of its first vehicle—a luxury EV sedan it dubbed the Lucid Air. It also announced plans to build a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and said it would begin producing the Air by 2018. 5. Since it was unveiled, the Air’s design has garnered high praise. Market commentators called it “a technological breakthrough” and heralded it as one of “the most compelling automotive launches in recent years.” But as one commentator noted, “a prototype, no matter how lovely, does not make a[n] automaker,” and “there’s quite a gulf between designing a great car and producing and selling that car.” Ultimately, Lucid’s success hinged entirely on its ability to ramp up commercial production of the Lucid Air. That is because the Air was essentially Lucid’s only source of potential revenue, and the Company could not recognize significant revenue from sales of the Air until it was able to mass produce vehicles and deliver them to paying customers. 6. The speed at which Lucid ramped production was also critical, for at least three reasons. First, although the Company boasted a substantial book of preorders for the Air, it had to get vehicles to customers before they got tired of waiting and cancelled their refundable orders. Second, while the EV market still had relatively few players, it was imperative for Lucid to quickly get production off the ground and grab market share before additional competitors entered the market. Third, the Company was burning through billions of dollars in cash getting production off the ground, and the longer it took to CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS start bringing in substantial revenues from the Air, the greater the chances that it would run out of funds. Simply put, Lucid’s ability to quickly ramp production would determine the Company’s future. And in that realm, as commentators noted, Lucid “remain[ed] entirely unproven.” 7. In the years that followed the Company’s unveiling of the Lucid Air prototype, Lucid struggled to raise much-needed cash as a private company, leading it to repeatedly delay the start of production. In 2018, desperate for capital, Lucid inked a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), to provide $1 billion in funds in exchange for the majority interest in the Company. Despite this infusion, by the beginning of 2021, Lucid still had not commenced commercial production of the Air and was again running low on cash. As a result, Lucid decided to seek funding from a new source—investors on the public market. 8. On February 22, 2021, Lucid announced plans to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV (“Churchill”) in order to bring the Company public through a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) transaction (the “Merger”).1 At the time, the Merger was the largest proposed SPAC transaction in history, and would provide Lucid with $4.4 billion in cash. Rawlinson was desperate to close the Merger, as he knew that cash was critical to Lucid’s ability to continue growing as a company. Indeed, when the Merger was announced, Lucid disclosed that it was so cash-strapped that it would require $600 million in bridge funding to continue its operations until the Merger closed. 9. Rawlinson was also highly motivated to close the Merger because he knew that, in doing so, he would not only earn a $2 million bonus, but would lock down a lucrative compensation package with a potential value of approximately $556 million. Lucid’s Board of Directors had approved the framework for Rawlinson’s compensation package before the Merger was announced, but made clear that “[s]uccessful merger completion” was necessary “to receive the grant at all.” 10. As the Merger approached, Rawlinson knew that investors were laser-focused on whether Lucid would finally be able to ramp up production of the Air after years of delay. To ensure that the Merger went through and provided Lucid with critical funding, he and the Company took a number of A SPAC—also known as a “blank check company”—is a publicly traded company created for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing private company. By merging with the publicly traded SPAC, the existing company “goes public” and begins trading on public markets. CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS steps to convince investors that it would, in fact, quickly ramp up production of the Air and begin generating substantial revenues. For example, in a February 22, 2021 investor presentation announcing the Merger, Rawlinson and Lucid told investors that the Company would produce 20,000 vehicles by the end of 2022, thus garnering more than $2 billion in 2022 revenues. Rawlinson continued to drive investor interest in Lucid by reiterating its 2022 production guidance in the run-up to the July 2021 Merger, assuring investors in May 2021 and July 2021 that Lucid would produce 20,000 EVs in 2022. 11. Even with the investor interest generated by Defendants’ repeated production promises, on the day the Merger was scheduled to close (July 22, 2021), Defendants had yet to garner the necessary votes from Churchill shareholders. So, that day, Rawlinson implored investors to “please, please vote,” and again reiterated that Lucid was ‘“energized about going into full production mode’ later this year.” 12. A day later, on July 23, 2021, the Merger closed. Lucid’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq on July 26, 2021. By going public through the SPAC Merger, Lucid secured $4.4 billion in additional funding and Rawlinson secured a $2 million bonus and a staggering $556 million in potential stock option compensation. Furthermore, because of the structure of Rawlinson’s stock option package— more than half of his options would only vest if the Company hit certain market capitalization targets within five years of going public—he remained highly motivated to keep Lucid’s common stock price inflated. As Rawlinson admitted, “I’m all in on stock options[,] that’s what motivates and drives me.”2 Thus, in the months that followed the Merger, Rawlinson continued to try and prop up Lucid’s stock price by assuring investors that Lucid was on track to meet its production targets. 13. On September 28, 2021, Lucid announced that—after multiple delays—it had finally begun production of the Air. Lucid made its first deliveries of the Air to customers on October 30, 2021. 14. The Class Period begins on November 15, 2021—the day that Lucid announced its first quarterly results as a public company. On that day, Defendants told investors that they were “confident in [their] ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022.” As for potential risks to that production, Defendants expressly directed investors only to then-existing “ongoing challenges facing the automotive industry, All emphasis is added and all original emphasis is omitted unless otherwise noted. CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS with global disruptions to supply chains and logistics,” but, in the same breath, assured investors that “[w]e are taking steps to mitigate these challenges.” 15. These statements were blatantly false. In the weeks leading up to November 15, 2021, Rawlinson himself admitted internally that Lucid would miss its production targets. In particular, according to former employee (“FE”)-2, during a meeting in October 2021 or the first week of November 2021, Rawlinson told a small group of Lucid employees that the Company would miss its targets and would produce less than 10,000 vehicles in 2022. Rawlinson further instructed the employees at the meeting to keep the fact that Lucid would miss its 2022 production target confidential. 16. Moreover, multiple former Lucid employees confirm that prior to Defendants’ November 2021 statements, Rawlinson was told that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production targets, and that the fact that Lucid would not meet this target was widely understood and discussed within the Company, including by Lucid’s top executive management. 17. Defendants also knew at all times leading up to and throughout the Class Period that Lucid was suffering from severe and pervasive internal problems unique to Lucid that made it impossible for the Company to mass produce vehicles. Thus, contrary to Defendants’ assurances, the then-existing headwinds Lucid was experiencing were neither transient nor borne by the industry as a whole, but were internal, structural in nature, widespread, and ongoing. 18. Nevertheless, when analysts pressed Defendants for answers concerning the status of Lucid’s production of the Air, they lied. Specifically, Defendants claimed that the main sticking point was whether the Company would be impacted by global supply-chain and logistics challenges impacting the automotive market as a whole, and that Lucid was already taking steps to mitigate these issues. 19. In truth, Defendants knew or were reckless in disregarding that Lucid suffered from severe internal, Lucid-specific issues that were significantly hampering its ability to produce vehicles. To start, Lucid’s inventory management systems were entirely ineffective and inoperable. This meant that the Company’s employees and other workers in Lucid’s Warehouse (defined below) lacked even the most basic information necessary to run the Warehouse, including that they had little or no information about how many parts the Company actually had at any given time, or even where parts were, and thus could not locate them when the production line requested them. This, in turn, negatively impacted CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS Lucid’s ability to efficiently reorder parts because it was unable to tell when inventory was low on or when it had run out of a particular part. 20. This chaos was compounded by the fact that Lucid’s Warehouse was operating significantly above capacity, which not only made it difficult to locate parts in piles stacked up to the ceiling, but also resulted in tens of millions of dollars in parts being smashed and destroyed. As a result of these and other significant internal logistics issues, the Company was unable to get parts from its Warehouse to its production line in a timely manner, which resulted in frequent production shutdowns. Indeed, former Lucid employees described the Warehouse as “a complete mess” and “utter chaos,” and confirmed that the vast majority of the Company’s production delays resulted from its failing internal logistics systems. These severe internal logistics issues were plaguing Lucid by no later than the summer of 2021, and persisted until at least the summer of 2022. 21. Even when Lucid’s production was slowed by actual parts shortages—as opposed to an inability to find the parts or get them to the production line—former employees confirmed that many such shortages were problems of Lucid’s own making. This was because the design of the Lucid Air was not sufficiently developed before production was launched and certain parts were not designed for manufacturability. That meant that suppliers were not able to produce parts to meet Lucid’s specifications, causing Lucid to rush to make multiple design changes even after production of the Air had already commenced, or labor to build vehicles with out of spec parts. This, in turn, led to production delays. 22. These facts were well-known by Defendants from day one of the Class Period. Prior to November 2021, Rawlinson and his top lieutenants were directly told about the severe issues in the Warehouse, and the negative impact that they were having on Lucid’s ability to produce vehicles. In addition, Rawlinson knew, based on discussions at internal meetings, that the Air’s design was not where it needed to be before Lucid launched production, which caused parts shortages and last minute design changes. 23. Still, beginning on November 15, 2021, Defendants concealed all of these internal issues that were already having a severe and negative impact on Lucid’s production, and instead told investors that the main risk to the Company’s targets was industry-wide supply chain issues, and that they were CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS already mitigating those risks. This gave investors the false and misleading impression that internally Lucid was ready and able to quickly ramp up production, when it was anything but. 24. Analysts and the financial media reacted positively to Defendants’ assurances. For example, the following day, CNBC reported that “[Lucid’s] market capitalization surpassed that of Ford Motor on Tuesday as investors reacted to management confirming production plans for 2022[.]” Bloomberg similarly wrote that Lucid shares “closed up 24% in New York, bringing its value to over $91 billion. . . . The surge in the shares came after Lucid said Monday it remained confident in its ability to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022.” 25. Defendants proceeded to then take full advantage of Lucid’s artificially inflated stock price. First, on December 8, 2021, Lucid announced a public offering of convertible senior notes. As market commentators noted, by using “[o]pportunistic timing” and “[t]aking advantage of a strong stock price,” Lucid was able to raise over $2 billion in gross proceeds to fund its business. Second, by January 25, 2022, Rawlinson had maintained Lucid’s high market capitalization for long enough to trigger four out of the five tranches of his performance-based stock options. As a result, Rawlinson received nearly 14 million Lucid stock options that were valued at approximately $263 million as of April 28, 2022. 26. Despite having known for months that Lucid would produce less than 10,000 units in 2022, even in mid-February 2022, Defendants still falsely assured investors that Lucid would produce 20,000 cars by year-end. Just two weeks later, however, on Lucid’s February 28, 2022 earnings call, Defendants did an abrupt about-face, admitting that Lucid would miss its 20,000 vehicle target by up to 40%, and slashing the Company’s 2022 production guidance to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On this news, Lucid’s stock price fell more than 13%, from a close of $28.98 per share on February 28, 2022, to a close at $24.99 per share on March 1, 2022. Market commentators likewise reacted negatively, calling Lucid’s “massive” guidance cut “particularly disappointing,” a “clear disappointment,” “jarring,” and a “[f]all from grace,” and noting that it “sen[t] shares . . . tumbling” and “plunged Lucid into an uphill battle to regain investor trust.” They further noted that “[t]he biggest threat to Lucid is that it misses on its already lower guidance and further slashes guidance in the coming quarters.” CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 27. Defendants, of course, knew that Lucid would miss even its reduced guidance figures as a result of the severe internal issues it was facing. Lucid’s internal logistics issues had not improved but, rather, as Rawlinson knew, were only getting worse. As a result, Defendants’ statements on February 28, 2022, were materially false or misleading, and Lucid’s stock price remained artificially inflated"

AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 1 the allegations herein and will continue to be revealed after Lead Plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity for discovery. This Action arises out of Defendants’ undisclosed failure to monitor and maintain inventory and implement effective internal controls, while simultaneously rushing and failing to roll out Cutera’s new acne-treating laser device, AviClear. Cutera had long been known to the investing public as a company that provided laser-based and other aesthetic and dermatological solutions for medical practitioners, and the new AviClear initiative appeared to fit within that long- term paradigm. The primary motivation for the AviClear rollout, however, was an executive compensation plan—known internally as the “Acne Equity Grant”—that shunted Company stock to the Individual Defendants in direct relation to (i) the number of AviClear devices placed with customers, and (ii) the speed with which such placements occurred. Moreover, throughout the Class Period, and notwithstanding Defendants’ SOX certifications and other sanguine remarks about Cutera’s internal control environment, Defendants consistently failed to control, monitor, and maintain inventory, largely related to problems associated with the failed AviClear rollout. This undisclosed failure of internal controls ultimately required Cutera to restate its financial statements for multiple quarters, particularly financial figures relating to inventory, cost of revenue, gross profit, gross margin, and operating loss. Indeed, Defendants eventually admitted that “we identified a significant issue with how the company has been managing inventory during 2023,” and “there was a shortfall of inventory relative to the Company’s system of record.” Moreover, the internal controls weaknesses had a myriad of operational consequences, including an extended inventory audit-related plant shutdown (which further negatively impacted Cutera’s business) and rampant quality control, supply chain, and field service problems due to the Company’s inability to forecast and track inventory. A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 2 6. Relatedly, Defendants’ failure to execute the AviClear rollout not only exacerbated these problems, but also over-allocated the Company’s manufacturing and sales resources to AviClear at the expense of Cutera’s core business segments which, up to that point, had generated steady and reliable revenue. The failed rollout likewise increased product returns and excess AviClear inventory, which contributed to the Company’s overall inventory and internal control problems. 7. Defendants’ Class Period conduct ultimately culminated in the terminations, with cause, of Defendants Mowry and Plants, and the resignation of Defendant Seth. As Defendants themselves conceded, Cutera was managed by “suboptimal leadership.” 8. Despite these undisclosed problems relating to non-functioning internal controls over inventory and experiencing poor financial performance as a result of the failed AviClear rollout, Defendants repeatedly claimed throughout the Class Period that the Company’s internal controls were operating effectively, that the AviClear rollout was a success, and that Cutera’s core revenue-generating business segments were flourishing. In fact, Defendants certified that they reviewed the Company’s financial reporting and that all figures contained therein were accurate— figures of which Defendants eventually admitted were materially false. 9. The underlying truth was ultimately revealed over a span of months during 2023 and 2024, whereby the Company disclosed: material weaknesses over financial reporting; multiple poor earnings results caused by its failure to properly roll out AviClear; that it had fired Mowry and Plants “with cause”; the departure of Defendant Seth; quality control problems leading to frequent equipment breakdowns and customer frustration; an extended plant shutdown caused by an inventory audit; poor AviClear utilization trends; numerous delays in making routine filings with the SEC; and restated financials for multiple quarters. In response, Cutera’s stock plummeted—injuring shareholders. Cutera’s Financial Reporting As a public company, Cutera must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, U.S.C. § 7241 (“SOX”), which required Cutera’s CEO and CFO to certify Cutera’s quarterly A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 3 and annual reports filed with the SEC and the procedures established by Cutera to prepare the financial statements and disclosures. Additionally, SOX required Cutera’s management to establish and maintain a system of internal controls relating to, among other things, financial reporting. SOX also required Cutera’s management to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and disclose the results of that evaluation, including any material weaknesses. However, Defendants failed to maintain adequate internal controls. 11. Since the beginning of the Class Period, Cutera faced multiple problems with its internal controls over inventory, including inventory-related information technology processes, inventory accounting, and supply chain management. Defendants, in fact, admitted as much when they ultimately disclosed in March 2024 that they failed to maintain adequate internal controls, and they were required to file restatements for the first and second quarters of 2023 (the “Restatement”)—which by its very definition means such restated financial figures were materially false. 12. Indeed, in January and February of 2022, just preceding the start of the Class Period, Defendants attempted to implement formal enterprise resource planning systems, since the Company did not previously have any formal method of managing inventory. However, Defendants failed to properly implement these systems, which made the inventory problems far worse. 13. For example, according to CW 6,3 while the company had an inventory system prior to the implementation of SAP and Salesforce (as defined below) in 2022, it was not a “formal” system. She recalled that Cutera had problems implementing its new Salesforce and SAP systems, adding that the company “went cheap,” and the implementation went “catastrophically downhill” as a result. 14. Similarly, CW 8, Senior Director, Field Service, North America, explained that there were two to three months of using these new systems without any formal training. CW 8 3 All CWs are described in detail in Section III.D (“Relevant Third Parties”), herein. A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 4 further recalled that it was “almost like there was no oversight” for the first few months with the new systems. 15. Furthermore, CW 6 explained that Cutera’s management—specifically Srinivas Pinapati,4 former Vice President of Operations and Supply Chain at Cutera—knew that anyone could walk into the warehouse area and take parts, as management’s offices were in the same building. CW 6 indicated that Pinapati had been told several times about the inventory problems. Likewise, CW 1, who held an executive leadership role, indicated that the company’s struggle with supply chain and inventory problems throughout 2023 were known to Mowry. 16. Defendants’ lack of control over inventory further led to an inability to account for the availability and demand for parts to service customers equipment, supply chain constraints, and delays in fulfilling customer orders, which angered customers, severely undercut Cutera’s reputation, and hampered revenue from device utilization as customers were unable to operate their broken equipment, problems of which were exacerbated by the rollout of AviClear as discussed below. All the while, Defendants knew of these problems. For example, CW 8 indicated that some customers sent complaints about their downed systems to Mowry directly. CW 1 also recalled that many people raised concerns about supply chain problems to Mowry. 17. Such problems involving Cutera’s inventory management processes and material weaknesses in Cutera’s information technology general controls (“ITGC”) dovetailed to create the perfect storm of operational chaos and accounting inaccuracies. For instance, during the Class Period, the material weaknesses in Cutera’s ITGC and inventory controls ultimately caused a four- week shutdown of Cutera’s warehouse due to an extended inventory audit stemming from inventory count inaccuracies, which was not only concealed at the time, but also further harmed Cutera’s business. CW 7 advised that Pinapati reported directly to Mowry, and that Pinapati had been hired by Mowry. A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 5 Defendants Know the AviClear Rollout is an Abject Failure While business operations crumbled and logistical difficulties born out of material weaknesses in Cutera’s internal controls proliferated, Defendants publicly rolled out their touted new product, AviClear. The fact that the rollout was driven, and to an extent initiated at all, primarily because the Individual Defendants wished to cash in on the Acne Equity Grant was not disclosed to investors during the Class Period. Indeed, Defendants decided to adopt a new lease-based commercial model to get AviClear into doctors’ offices as quickly as possible. In doing so, Defendants chose to divert too many resources—principally the sales teams’ resources—away from Cutera’s once-strong and reliable business segments. Indeed, as CW 2 explained, Cutera wanted to get AviClear into the market as quickly as possible, and into as many customers’ offices. Additionally, because Defendants were financially incentivized to do so, they were unconcerned whether customers actually used the AviClear device (which was how Cutera actually generates its AviClear revenue). The financial incentives had their intended effect—albeit at the expense of the rest of Cutera’s businesses. In fact, the Board ultimately concluded, as one of the reasons for terminating Defendant Plants in April 2023, that “Mr. Plants was far more interested in his own personal enrichment than in leading the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders.” Critically, CW 1 confirmed that the directive to move away from Cutera’s core business to focus on AviClear came directly from Mowry and Plants and was discussed openly in many AviClear meetings. However, Defendants’ plan to rush the AviClear rollout resulted in Defendants using a leasing model that customers rejected and pumping out a product not fully tested, which led to AviClear device failures, upset customers, and returned devices—all of which contributed to inventory buildup and internal control problems. Indeed, CW 7 explained that AviClear’s high failure rate was caused by the company’s rushed timeline in pushing the new product to market. A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 6 22. Moreover, as the Company began rolling out AviClear, Cutera began experiencing significant inventory and quality control problems. As Defendant Hopkins ultimately admitted, “[o]n the reliability front, those issues really did begin to surface as we ramped up Avi.” Defendant Hopkins similarly explained that “the organization was a bit overwhelmed and stretched and as the manufacturing organization ramped up Avi, reliability issues began to surface across the portfolio of products.” These quality control problems severely undercut Cutera’s ability to generate revenue from customers’ utilization of the AviClear device. 23. Numerous CWs confirm that Defendants knew of the litany of problems with the AviClear rollout—which ultimately led to an overabundance of returns, contributing to the Company’s inventory crisis. For example, CW 2, who was hired to sell AviClear exclusively, indicated that some offices were so dissatisfied with AviClear that they tried to send it back. CW 2 also noted that many of her contacts at doctor’s offices informed her that they would not deal with Cutera due to a reputation for poor customer support and questionable practices. CW 2 indicated that she and her colleagues communicated these concerns—and the problems raised by customers who were not responding positively to AviClear—to T.J. Huffman (“Huffman”) Vice President, North American Sales, who reported directly to Mowry. 24. Notably, in light of the growing number of returns, coupled with Cutera’s lack of internal controls, Cutera’s inventory counts were wildly inaccurate. For instance, Defendant Drummond even stated at the end of the Class Period, in response to an analyst’s question surrounding Cutera’s inventory problem, that “[i]t relates to a process happening in our [inventory management] system, whereby returns were ending up being doubled up in value.” In fact, in describing the persisting internal control problems, Defendants ultimately admitted on the last day of the Class Period that “we’ve had too much inventory in certain areas, most notably AviClear.” AviClear Rollout, Defendants Tout the Opposite to Investors Nonetheless, Defendants repeatedly represented to investors that the AviClear rollout was a success, that demand and interest were strong, and Cutera’s core businesses continued to deliver strong results. For example, in August 2022, Mowry touted that “[d]uring the A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 7 quarter, our team achieved the successful launch of AviClear,” and “I am excited by the momentum we continue to see in our core business.” In a September 8, 2022 press release, Defendants stated that “AviClear has seen growing physician adoption and steadily increasing patient demand since its launch in April 2022.” Cutera further touted in November 2022 that “Aviclear has seen widespread interest from physicians and patients following its FDA clearance in March 2022.” As noted above, and discussed in greater detail herein, those statements stood in marked contradiction to the (non-public) facts known and discussed within the Company, including by and with the Individual Defendants. 26. Furthermore, Defendants affirmatively represented in Cutera’s SEC filings throughout the Class Period that they “[d]esigned such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under the [Company’s] supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with [GAAP].” Again, as noted above and discussed in detail herein, those statements were knowingly false when made. 27. The truth regarding the Company’s internal controls and the failed AviClear rollout emerged over the course of a series of corrective disclosures and/or materialization of the concealed risk events. Notably, the truth of Defendants’ fraudulent misconduct was fully revealed March 21, 2024. 28. Indeed, despite the truth partially leaking out on each of the following dates, the Company’s stock price remained artificially inflated after each date because, as further detailed in Sections IV, V, and VII, herein, Defendants continued reassuring the market that the AviClear rollout was a success, that the Company’s Core Capital business (“Core Capital”) was not hurting as a result of AviClear, and that there were no problems with Cutera’s internal controls. In addition to Defendants’ continued reassurances, not all of the concealed risks materialized until March 21, 2024—as evidenced not only by the actual news revealed on those dates and analyst reactions to A MENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF TH E FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 8 such news, but notably, by the large stock price declines in response to each continuing corrective disclosure and/or materialization of the concealed risk event: (a) On January 9, 2023, the Company issued revenue projections below market expectations directly linked to the unsuccessful AviClear rollout. Indeed, according to analyst Piper Sandler’s conversation with Cutera management, Piper Sandler reported that same day that Cutera’s sales teams “spent the majority of time pushing AviClear,” and “in doing so, the team took their eye off the ball for the rest of the business, primarily in the US and leading to a majority of the revenue shortfall we see here in the quarter.” In response, Cutera’s stock price fell more than 23%. However, Cutera’s stock price remained artificially inflated as Defendants continued concealing from investors that the AviClear rollout was a failure, motivated primarily by the Individual Defendants’ desire for personal compensation, and harmed Core Capital. (b) On March 16, 2023, Defendants announced Cutera would not meet the extended deadline for filing its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”) and disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over stock-based compensation, causing a 12.5% drop in Cutera’s stock price. Still, the Company’s stock price remained artificially inflated even after this news because many concealed risks had yet to materialize as of this date, including, among other things, that Cutera had experienced an extended plant shutdown due to the Company’s ongoing inventory problems. (c) On April 12, 2023, the Company announced that the Board had terminated Defendants Plants and Mowry “with cause.” In response, Cutera’s stock price fell more than 28%. However, Defendants continued concealing the full truth from investors, which included, among other"

      "summary": "Plaintiffs Dr. Myo Thant and Branden Schenkhuizen bring this securities class action on behalf of all persons who purchased Rain common stock between April 23, 2021, and May 19, 2023 (the “Class Period”), asserting claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §78a, et seq., and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k and 77o. Rain introduced itself to investors during its initial public offering as a “clinical-stage precision oncology company” on the verge of launching a “pivotal Phase 3 trial” for a liposarcoma drug with a potential market value of $1 billion. Integral to Rain’s pitch was the claim that the Phase 3 trial had been “de-risked” based on trial data collected during a previous Phase 1 trial. According to Rain and its senior executive officers, the Phase 1 trial data was so strong that it supported the Company’s decision to advance directly to a Phase 3 trial and completely skip Phase 2. This maneuver, which is referred to as “Phase 2 Bypass,” is appropriate in only limited, narrow circumstances. Those circumstances were not present in this case. Unfortunately, investors who bought in on the hype found out too late and only after they lost nearly everything. Clinical trials in the United States are typically conducted in three phases. Phase 1 is performed to test the safety profile of a drug and identify tolerable doses. If the drug appears to be reasonably safe, the doses identified in Phase 1 are then used in a Phase 2 trial across a larger population. Phase 3 is then conducted across an even greater number of participants to obtain enough safety and efficacy information to support a “New Drug Application” with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. Only upon approval of a New Drug Application can a drug company proceed to commercialize the drug and generate revenue from sales. Although not commonly done, a drug company can skip Phase 2 in the clinical trial process (i.e., Phase 2 Bypass) where the drug’s mechanism of action and safety profile are well characterized. A drug’s mechanism of action refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect, e.g., the specific molecular targets to which a drug binds or how the drug works from a biochemical point of view. The safety profile of a drug refers to the frequency of adverse effects that are treatment emergent or how likely a drug is to cause its user to suffer adverse side effects. The drug at issue in this case is milademetan. Milademetan was a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (“MDM2”). MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors (which is a category of drugs that included milademetan) have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Although MDM2 inhibitors have been studied for almost two decades, none has progressed past early-phase clinical trials in solid-tumor patients due to the fact that they cause myelosuppression (i.e., a decrease in bone marrow activity that results in reduced production of blood cells). A Japanese corporation named Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), initially developed milademetan and conducted its Phase 1 clinical trial. The Phase 1 trial was a “first-in-human” trial, meaning that it was the first time milademetan was ever given to humans. The Phase 1 trial data demonstrated that milademetan administered at a particular dose resulted in a 3-4x improvement in patients with well-differentiated/de-differentiated (“WD/DD”) liposarcoma (“LPS”) over general standard of care treatment. These results, however, were based on a subset of data from just 16 patients within the study or roughly 15% of the overall trial. In September 2020, Rain acquired a license to develop and potentially sell milademetan from Daiichi Sankyo. Defendants told investors during Rain’s initial public offering and throughout the Class Period that Daiichi Sankyo’s Phase 1 trial data supported skipping Phase 2 and proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial. Defendants made this claim even though milademetan did not meet the criteria for Phase 2 Bypass and in spite of the fact that Daiichi Sankyo’s clinical trial plan called for a Phase 2 trial. The risks associated with Rain’s Phase 2 Bypass were severe and well-above those that reasonable investors expected to assume when investing in the stock. Contrary to Defendants’ public representations, the Phase 1 data did not sufficiently identify the correct dosage for milademetan. Had Rain conducted the Phase 2 trial, this would have come to light and could have been corrected. However, Defendants decided to roll the dice and engage in a reckless gamble with the money they raised from their public investors. If the Phase 3 trial results proved favorable, then Rain would have successfully saved hundreds of millions of dollars that the Company otherwise would have had to spend conducting a lengthy Phase 2 trial. Moreover, by skipping the Phase 2 trial, Rain increased the odds of making it first to market, thereby ensuring its superiority status against the competition. Defendants’ intentions in this regard are unmistakable. The SEC repeatedly admonished Defendants and, in particular, Rain’s Chief Executive Officer, Avanish Vellanki, for making unsupported statements in the Company’s registration statement and prospectus. As soon as the initial public offering was done, Vellanki and his fellow senior executives, including the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Richard Bryce, resorted to making the same false and baseless claims they were told not to make. Above all, despite the acute risks associated with the Phase 2 Bypass, Defendants repeatedly referred to their rapid commencement of the Phase 3 study as a boon to the Company and its overall prospects. The truth finally emerged when, on May 22, 2023, Rain announced that its Phase 3 trial failed due to a lack of efficacy and elevated levels of adverse safety events. Analysts reported on the results, noting the risks of proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial from Phase 1. The analysts also noted the increased level of Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events, which suggested that the dosing schedule had not been properly optimized during the Phase 1 trial. Analysts also noted that Rain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Robert C. Doebele, acknowledged during a conference call earlier in the day that the 260 mg dose was too high. In response to the news, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023 to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023. During the Class Period, Plaintiffs and other similarly situated investors bought Rain securities at artificially inflated prices due to Defendants’ false and/or materially misleading statements. When the truth concerning Rain’s clinical trial risks emerged, Rain’s stock price decreased resulting in significant losses to investors. This action seeks to compensate those investors and recover the damages they sustained because of Defendants’ actions and statements.",

Plaintiffs allege that, from November 15, 2023 to August 7, 2024 (the “Class Period”), Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding: (1) macroeconomic impacts on Fastly’s business, (2) continued revenue growth from existing enterprise customers (especially its largest customers), and (3) the company’s ongoing emphasis on driving growth from existing customers. Plaintiffs claim that, contrary to public statements, Fastly’s largest customers were already reducing usage and demanding deeper discounts due to macroeconomic pressures and increased competition; that the company’s sales strategy shifted in 2024 to prioritize new customer acquisition (despite claiming focus on existing customers); and that Fastly discontinued key metrics (DBNER and NRR) that would have revealed declining growth from existing customers. Plaintiffs rely heavily on confidential witness accounts from former Fastly employees, who describe declining renewals and contract cancellations in 2023, failure to land new customers, and internal awareness of these problems through all-hands meetings and customer operations meetings attended by the C-suite. The complaint details three corrective disclosures (Feb 14, May 1, and Aug 7, 2024) where Fastly lowered revenue guidance and partially revealed the truth about declining revenue from top customers, causing sharp stock price drops.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"The plaintiffs in this class action are short sellers of Vicor Corporation’s common stock who covered their short positions in the days following and including July 25, 2023. Plaintiffs include Daniel Pogrebinsky (California), Benjamin Pouladian (California), David Mead (Washington), Aaron Goldman (New Jersey), Dr. Vijaykumar Agrawal (Tennessee), Kent Maguire (Kentucky), Timothy McKillican (Canada), and Zi Xu (Canada/Dubai). The defendants are Vicor Corporation (Delaware corporation, principal place of business in Massachusetts) and its CEO, Patrizio Vinciarelli (Massachusetts). On July 25, 2023, Vicor announced it had entered into a new agreement with a large existing customer for its next generation 4G lateral power distribution design that Vicor expected to start delivering in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was the first positive news for Vicor in a while. And given that it was already generally known that Vicor Corporation’s two major customers were Nvidia and Google, investors were understandably excited, and the stock price shot up immediately. Relying on the news and the concomitant price increase, each Plaintiff was forced to cover their short positions, which for some included derivative securities, and suffered substantial losses. PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 1 The July 25th announcement was false, and the proof is in the cover up. When Vicor and Vinciarelli were confronted about their misstatements, they headed for the familiar refuges that people who don’t tell the truth run for —first they denied saying what they said, and then a year later after this lawsuit was filed, they admitted saying it but tried to explain what they really meant. Indeed, during its October 24, 2023, third-quarter investor call, less than three months after announcing the significant customer deal, Vicor announced continued struggles and never brought up the customer. And when pressed for an update on that, Vicor did not mention that the customer changed its mind, it dodged and pivoted—Vicor denied ever having represented that it had a significant customer contract, insisting that any growth was solely expected to occur in the “medium to long term”—e.g., 2025 or 2026—from locating and selling to new unidentified customers. Immediately, the stock price careened down and settled well below where it had been on July 25—at or near the price that Plaintiffs believed they would have covered their short positions. Plaintiffs are entitled to damages. PARTIES 1. Plaintiff Daniel Pogrebinsky is an individual citizen of the State of California who resides in San Mateo County. 2. Plaintiff Benjamin Pouladian is an individual citizen of the State of California who resides in Los Angeles County. 3. Plaintiff David Mead is an individual citizen of the State of Washington who resides in King County. 4. Plaintiff Aaron Goldman is an individual citizen of the State of New Jersey who resides in Bergen County. 5. Plaintiff Dr. Vijaykumar Agrawal is an individual citizen of the State of Tennessee who resides in Memphis County. 6. Plaintiff Kent Maguire is an individual citizen of the State of Kentucky who resides in Louisville County. PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 2 7. Timothy McKillican is an individual citizen of Canada who resides in Ontario, Canada. 8. Zi Xu is a citizen of Canada and is domiciled in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 9. Each Plaintiff hereabove individually is referred to a “Plaintiff” and collectively, “Plaintiffs”. 10. Defendant Vicor Corporation (“Vicor”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. Vicor has been properly served and has agreed to answer this Complaint within sixty days of its filing. 11. Defendant Patrizio Vinciarelli (“Vinciarelli”, together with Vicor, “Defendants”), the CEO of Vicor, is an individual citizen of the State of Massachusetts who resides in Suffolk County. He has been properly served and has agreed to answer this Complaint within sixty days of its filing. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 12. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a). 13. Venue is proper in this Court because at least one Plaintiff resides in this district and division, Vicor regularly does business in this district via its place of business in Santa Clara, California, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is situated in this district. Additionally, Nvidia and Google—Vicor’s largest and most significant customers whose transactions (or lack thereof) are supposedly undergirding the issues in this case—are located in this district. 14. Personal jurisdiction is proper over Defendants because of Defendants’ actions promoting and discussing its stock on a nationwide broadcast and with national investors, because Defendants directed false and fraudulent communications to the State of California, and because Defendant regularly does business in this district. PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 3 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 15. Vinciarelli founded Vicor in 1981. 16. Vicor designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and complete power systems that deliver and/or manage electrical power for deployment in, among other areas, high-performance computing, industrial equipment and automation, robotics, unmanned and manned vehicles, and satellites.1 17. Vinciarelli has served as President and CEO of Vicor since its founding. 18. Vicor’s stock is actively traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. 19. Upwards of a million Vicor shares were traded every day on average between March and October 2023, with that number exceeding 4.5 million in a single day following the disclosures at issue in this lawsuit. 20. Vicor is followed and rated by several analysts, including, but not limited to, Craig-Hallum, Needham, CJS Securities, BWS Securities, and Northland Capital Markets. 21. Previously, Vicor’s two largest customers had been Google and Nvidia. 22. One of Vicor’s significant feats early on was having its power-management components featured as part of Nvidia’s Artificial Intelligence chips—Nvidia’s Flagship Datacenter AI GPUs—and in Google’s 48V server infrastructure.2 23. When Nvidia’s new AI chips emerged in 2022 but did not feature Vicor’s power designs or components, Vicor’s shares slid over 20%, starting on March 23, 2022, with the trend continuing thereafter.3 24. By early 2023, many market commentators who follow the industry, and those who follow Vicor specifically, were questioning the continued reliability of the 1 https://www.vicorpower.com/about-the-company (last visited, 5/18/2024). 2 https://seekingalpha.com/article/4179454-vicor-ais-pure-play-datacenter-acceleration-power-arms- dealer?ref=the-razors-edge.ghost.io (last visited, 5/18/2024). https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-vicor-shares-powered-off-today (last visited, 5/18/2024). PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 4 relationship between Vicor and Nvidia or Google.4 25. Through July 2023, according to its public SEC filings, Vicor repeatedly failed to achieve expected milestones, its order backlog5 shrunk with new orders not replacing the older ones as they were delivered, and revenue declined. 26. For example, on February 22, 2024, Vicor reported in a press release that “Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $92.7 million, a 12.2% decrease from $105.5 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and a 14.1% sequential decrease from $107.8 million in the third quarter of 2023” and that “Backlog for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $160.8 million, a 47.2% decrease from $304.4 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and 8.0% sequential decrease from $174.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023.”6 27. Soon after that, in its 10Q released in May 2023, Vicor explained that: Backlog, which represents the total value of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately $271,283,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2023, as compared to $304,392,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022… …and Net revenues decreased 7.3% to $97,816,000 for the first quarter of 2023, from $105,493,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net revenues for Brick Products increased 10.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the ability to shift manufacturing resources to focus on available backlog, as well as favorable market conditions. 4 https://the-razors-edge.ghost.io/vicor-short-thesis-ai-chip-mania-accelerates-vicors-competitive- demise-provides-an-asymmetric-short-opportunity/(last visited, 5/18/2024). “Backlog…consists of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the following 12 months, subject to our scheduling and cancellation policies.” Vicor 2022 SEC Form 10k at p.7. https://vicorcorporation.gcs-web.com/static-files/3dd8c0e2-9b5f-496f-bbb3-d131f1f98871 https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/02/22/2834085/0/en/Vicor-Corporation-Reports- Results-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-and-Year-Ended-December-31-2023.html PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 5 Advanced Products net revenue decreased 19.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to continued supply constraints leading to longer cycle-times and schedule delays. … Gross margin decreased to $46,534,000 for the first quarter of 2023 from $49,139,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022, but gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 47.6% for the first quarter of 2023 from 46.6% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in gross margin dollars and the increase in gross margin percentage were primarily a result of the unfavorable impact from lower sales volume offset by reduced freight-in and tariff spending of $3,927,000 (net of approximately $3,000,000 in duty drawback recovery of previously paid tariffs).7 28. Vicor further reported $4.5 million fewer accounts receivable for that period in this same filing. These reflected a continuing trend in Vicor’s performance that was cemented by the fact that it had lost its relationship with Nvidia and Google. 29. Thus, to the common investor, Vicor’s stock appeared significantly overvalued given the business’s condition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated looked at Vicor’s downward trend as a core thesis for shorting Vicor’s stock. 30. Each Plaintiff—and those similarly situated—took several short positions over the course of approximately twelve weeks starting on or around May 1, 2023.8 31. According to publicly available data, over three million shares had been sold short as of July 25, 2023. This does not include the number of short positions taken by investors via options positions or other derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. 7 https://vicorcorporation.gcs-web.com/static-files/fc6d988d-9b13-4388-a634-b64b8af13385 at p.18. 8 Plaintiffs’ relevant short positions and cover purchases are appended hereto in Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 6 32. Shortly before trading closed on July 25, 2023, Vicor released its Q2 earnings report. Its companion press release on that day concluded with the first bit of real good news in a while: Commenting on second quarter performance, Chief Executive Officer Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q2 bookings remained weak, ahead of production release of an AI platform with a Lateral Power Distribution Network (‘PDN’) using a 4G ChiP-set, now expected to ramp in Q4. The same 4G ChiP-set will support a more adept Lateral- Vertical PDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy workloads and superior processor performance.”9 33. The message was plain: newly booked sales of the Lateral Power Distribution Network (itself a new product) would reverse the lengthy trend of “weak” sales. 34. During Vicor’s 2023 Q2 earnings call after the market closed that same day, July 25, 2023, the analysts’ questions reflected that they received the same message: Good news—a customer had been confirmed for the new product. 35. The only question the analysts wanted an answer to was how big of a customer. 36. For example, Quinn Bolton, an analyst from Needham & Company who follows Vicor, asked Vinciarelli about how large a difference in sales this customer was likely to represent in the fourth quarter: Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. First question is, can you guys share any more details 9 https://vicorcorporation.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vicor-corporation-reports- results-second-quarter-ended-june-12. The Press release itself was announced by an 8-k filing on July 25, 2023. https://vicorcorporation.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-23-193449 PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 7 on the 4G lateral power distribution design that you mentioned in the press release for a new AI platform that ramps in the fourth quarter. Can you say, is this a new customer? Have you worked with this customer previously? Can you give us any sense of what our consumption is for this part? Is it a high power card? Is it a mid- range power card? Any details you can share would be very helpful. Patrizio Vinciarelli It’s an existing customer. It’s a new generation for the existing customer. And it’s a chipset that can be deployed either in a lateral PDN, which is substantially handicapped from a power system perspective to the point that it limits power delivery, power capability, process of performance, in that it gives rise to large losses within the copper of the substrate to the GPU, that it powers. It gives rise to further losses within the system itself, or into the limitations of lateral power delivery applied at the 1,000 amp level. With a 4G chipset, we can enable a lateral solution with the same handicaps, or with a vertical element using the same chipset, a lateral vertical solution, which is unique, highly differentiated, in that it improves system efficiency by about 10%. And it improves a number of limitations relating to process of performance [bolding added]. 37. The question posed to Vinciarelli indicated that the market was focusing on the news that the new customer agreement would overcome the prior quarters’ weak sales. This was the only real positive news about Vicor in several quarters, and especially during that time frame. 38. On that same call, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, John Dillon, again attempted to confirm the size of the customer with Vinciarelli who confirmed it was a large customer: PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 8 John Dillon Okay, great. I want to follow up on Quinn’s question a little bit. . . . Regarding the lateral vertical opportunity that’s coming to production in Q4, is that a high-volume customer is more of a lower volume or more of a modest volume customer [sic]? Patrizio Vinciarelli So, to be clear, I’ve suggested earlier, the same chip set, which is a 4G chip set, supports both the lateral and the lateral vertical. Based on constant input expectation, as of now, is that the lateral implementation will go first. And that's the one we’re anticipating for the Q4 ramp. I can’t tell you when the lateral vertical was going to production, but my expectation is that it would be after the lateral. John Dillon Yes, but is this going to be a significant customer or is this more of an incremental volume that you’re going to expect? Patrizio Vinciarelli This is a significant customer [bolding added]. 39. Throughout the call, Vicor admitted to the poor performance and prospects (namely, the radical decrease in orders in the prior quarters), but Vinciarelli explicitly touted that a “significant” “existing” customer had agreed to make product purchases, the delivery of which was slated to begin in Q4 2023. 40. Vicor’s management—Vinciarelli included—gave specific details regarding the customer as if they were real, e.g., that the customer would use the lateral PDN implementation first and the lateral-vertical PDN implementation later. 41. Management of Vicor gave additional, specific details that the customer would have power delivery “applied at the 1,000 amp level.” 42. Management reiterated that this concerned an “existing” and “significant” Vicor customer seeking the “new generation” part. PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PAGE 9 43. These details gave the unmistakable impression that a concrete deal had been reached for an existing—not speculative—large customer of a significant number of purchases in the fourth quarter, which would have reversed Vicor’s trend of declining and weak sales. 44. Consistent with the messaging, the market took this information to suggest that Vicor had a new partnership deal with Nvidia or Google. 45. The market’s reaction to this news was immediate and pronounced: whereas Vicor’s stock had closed on July 25, 2023, at $59 before the above earnings announcements, it then opened the next morning on July 26, 2023, at $77.40 and closed at the end of the day at $93.70, reaching an intra-day high of over $94. 46. Average trading volume prior to and after July 26, 2023, had been consistent at around 800,000 to 1.2 million shares per day; but on July 26, 2023, volume exceeded 4.5 million shares, roughly five to six times higher than normal. 47. Because of the skyrocketing price, and in reliance on the announcement of a new “significant customer” who was also an “existing customer,” each Plaintiff was forced to cover their short positions at a significant loss—roughly $35 per share on average, in addition to the roughly $15"

Key Facts: According to the Offering Documents, Robinhood’s mission was to “democratize finance for all.” The Company claimed to be riding a profound transformation in how people think about money driven by the emergence of younger investors and non-traditional investors such as “gig economy workers.” The pillars of Robinhood’s strategy to reach these new and/or non- traditional investors supposedly were: (i) a primary focus on the safety and reliability of Robinhood’s trading platform; (ii) a focus on the needs of smaller investors; (iii) a “radical” focus on responding to customer problems and feedback; and (iv) a willingness to make “bold bets” that challenge the status quo. Legal Claims: The Offering Documents also misleadingly claimed that as a result of Robinhood’s supposedly successful strategy, the Company was experiencing growth: Class Period: The Offering Documents also misleadingly claimed that as a result of Robinhood’s supposedly successful strategy, the Company was experiencing growth:",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"The complaint is a federal securities class action filed by Lead Plaintiff Steamfitters Local 449 Pension & Retirement Security Funds against SunPower Corporation and its executives, Peter Faricy (CEO, President, and Chairman) and Manavendra S. Sial (former CFO and Executive VP), alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws under §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The class action is brought on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of SunPower Corporation during the period from August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and who suffered damages as a result of the conduct alleged herein. The action is brought against SunPower, Peter Faricy (“Faricy”), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, and Manavendra S. Sial (“Sial,” together with Faricy “Individual Defendants,” and Individual Defendants collectively with the Company, “Defendants”), the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Executive Vice President, for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 3. During the Class Period, Defendants violated §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5, by making false and misleading statements and omissions concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 1 - guidance;1 and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components. II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW 4. SunPower describes itself as a solar energy company that delivers complete solar solutions to customers primarily in the United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options, as well as “Smart Energy” solutions. The Company was founded in 1985, and held its Initial Public Offering on November 16, 2005. The Company’s stock has traded on the NASDAQ since 2005 under the symbol “SPWR.” In 2011, SunPower became a majority- owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies Solar INTL SAS (“TotalEnergies”). 5. The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of solar energy generation, storage, and use products and services in what is called the downstream “Distributed Generation” or “DG” residential (often referred to as “resi”) and commercial markets. SunPower, which in 2020 divested its manufacturing business, Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (“Maxeon”),2 relies on key technology and components from a limited number of third-party suppliers to incorporate into the hardware it sells (or leases) to its customers. 6. At the start of the Class Period, the Company divided its business into three main segments: Residential, Light Commercial (“RLC”); Commercial and Industrial Solutions (either “CIS” or “C&I,” sometimes described as the large or heavy commercial portion of the business); and “Others.” SunPower, and the financial analysts that follow the Company, frequently referred to the “light commercial” portion of SunPower’s RLC business as “Light Commercial Value-Added Reseller” or “CVAR.” For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the Company reported $1.125 billion in total revenue. Approximately $848 million (~75% of total revenues) of that total was As used herein “FY” means SunPower’s fiscal year. SunPower reports on a fiscal year that runs until the Sunday closest to the end of the applicable calendar year. Thus, FY21 means SunPower’s fiscal year 2021, which ran from January 4, 2021 until January 2, 2022. Specific quarters are designated by the quarter number followed by the letter Q, and the last two numbers of the fiscal year. Thus, 3Q21 indicates SunPower’s third quarter in fiscal year 2021, which ran from July 5, 2021, to October 3, 2021. Maxeon continued through the Class Period to be SunPower’s exclusive supplier of solar panels. AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 2 - generated from the RLC segment; $255 million (~23%) from CIS; and $66 million (~5.9%) from “Others.”3 7. The quality of SunPower’s products, which SunPower warrants, and SunPower’s “leadership” in the commercial market, were important points of differentiation for the Company. As Wells Fargo reported in a June 29, 2022 analyst report titled “SPWR: Initiating Coverage with an Underweight Rating,” “SunPower has historically differentiated its offering based on hardware (Maxeon panels and Enphase micro-inverters), commercial leadership (voted top provider), and an integrated warranty contract that covers all components (panels, inverters, batteries).”4 8. On April 19, 2021, Defendant Faricy became CEO, President and a member of SunPower’s Board of Directors. Faricy took over at a time of uneven performance for the Company, and in his first two conference calls with analysts and investors he described his focus as “diving deep” into SunPower’s residential and commercial business segments: • [5/5/21 call:] “My focus over the next 100 days will center around diving deep into the residential and commercial, and industrial businesses.” • [5/13/21 call:] “In the near term, my focus over the next 100 days will center around diving deep into the residential, commercial and industrial businesses.” During the Class Period, beginning with the Company’s reporting of its 2Q21 financial results on August 3, 2021, Defendants falsely asserted (or omitted to state facts necessary to make the statements not misleading), among other things, that the Company’s commercial business was performing well and was currently on track for the Company to meet its financial guidance. In a press release issued that day, Faricy was quoted as stating: • “‘Our solid second quarter results reflect continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses . . . .’” In combination these totals exceed 100% because they do not include negative “Intersegment and GAAP adjustments.” As SunPower explains, “[e]very solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC [alternating current] power that is ready for use.” Microinverters, in contrast to “string” inverters, allow individual solar panels or modules within a larger system or array to be monitored and shutdown individually. For example, in case of damage that may cause a fire, or on a precautionary basis, such as during inspection or repair. AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 3 - • “‘[W]e remain on track to achieve our 2021 financial outlook and are well positioned to drive growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond.’” Also on August 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s financial results and guidance. During the call, Sial also falsely told investors that the heavy commercial or CIS business was performing well, in particular representing that the commercial segment’s margin performance was “significantly better”: I think the business is significantly better year-on-year, both from a top line perspective as well as a margin point of view. And then more importantly, we expect the CIS business to be profitable in the back half of the year, which you recall is a significant turnaround from the last couple of years. The next day, on August 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective: • “The failure of a supplier to supply . . . components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.” • “If we have quality issues with our solar and related products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed.” • “[D]efects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty, and re- engineering costs.” • “[W]e may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers’ warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs.” • “[P]otential future product or component failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products or components.” • “Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.” • “[Q]uality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.” AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 4 - 12. On October 5, 2021, Defendants held a conference call to announce that they were exploring “strategic options” for the CIS business segment, indicating that Defendants were considering selling it. Defendants nevertheless continued to tout the ongoing strength of SunPower’s commercial business and affirmed that CIS was indeed “a point of strength” and “very healthy.” 13. On November 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s 3Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Faricy falsely described the state of the Company’s operations and balance sheet, stating: Over the past few years, you’ve been with us through several major restructuring events and strategic changes. I’m pleased to report we have found our footing. With a streamlined company and our healthiest balance sheet in years, we are now going on offense to grow our business across a vast, mostly untapped residential TAM. 14. On November 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. Like the quarterly report for 2Q21, the 3Q21 Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective: • “The failure of a supplier to supply… components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.” • “If we have quality issues with our solar and related products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed.” • “[D]efects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty, and re- engineering costs.” • “[W]e may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers’ warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs.” • “[P]otential future product or component failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products or components.” • “Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.” • “[Q]uality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 5 - costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.” Each of the above representations concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial guidance; and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components was materially false and misleading when made because Defendants knew or deliberately disregarded and failed to disclose the following facts: (a) cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems had already developed in nearly all of the Company’s commercial systems; (b) as a result of the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems, SunPower would be required to incur tens of millions in costs to replace those defective third-party components; and (c) in light of (a) and (b) above, SunPower was not on track to achieve its FY21 financial guidance. Throughout the Class Period, the Company’s stock price traded at artificially inflated prices as high as $34.61. Based on Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions, investors expected that the Company’s commercial business was and would continue to be a key driver of revenue and margin growth, and that the Company’s financial results would not be negatively affected by already existing product defects. The artificial inflation of the Company’s stock price was maintained by Defendants’ continued boasting of the strength of the commercial business, as the truth about the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems remained concealed from the investing public. On December 7, 2021, SunPower published to its website the latest edition of its manual for Safety and Installation Instructions for the United States and Canada. The manual contained newly added language concerning cracking in connectors not present in the 2019 or 2020 AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 6 - editions of the United States and Canada manual. The December 7, 2021 manual included the following new warnings: • “Do not allow the connectors to come in contact with chemicals such as greases, oils and organic solvents which may cause stress cracking.” • “Connectors are factory assembled with intentional gaps between the cable nut and the body of the connector. Do not retighten module connector nuts as this may lead to stress cracking of the connector assembly and will void the warranty.” 18. In addition, the December 7, 2022 manual added new advisories concerning best practices for safely handling connectors, such as: • “For connectors, which are accessible to untrained people, it is imperative to use the locking connectors and safety clips, if applicable, in order to defend against untrained personnel disconnecting the modules once they have been installed.” • “Avoid exposure of electrical connections to direct sunlight and do not place the connector in a location where water could easily accumulate.” 19. After December 7, 2021, the Company’s stock price continued to trade at artificially inflated prices above $18 per share. 20. Then, on January 20, 2022, SunPower issued a press release preannouncing that it would miss its earnings guidance for 4Q21 and FY21 and expected approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 due to “cracking” problems in products across its commercial business segments: “Through a product quality assessment, the company has identified a cracking issue that developed over time in certain factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment supplied to SunPower. . . . SunPower expects approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 as it pursues recovery of costs from the suppliers.” 21. The release also noted that SunPower, no doubt in response, had hired a new executive to oversee the Company’s supply chain. 22. Following SunPower’s January 20, 2022 preannouncement, financial analysts were quick to report on the scope and timing of the problem. “[N]early all” of SunPower’s commercial solar systems were affected, which would cost an estimated $31 million and require replacement AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS - 4:22-cv-00956-HSG - 7 - throughout 2022. Importantly, analysts reported that Defendants must have learned about the pervasive problem of cracking in third-party components in conducting due diligence pursuant to selling the CIS business segment, if not earlier. For example: • January 21, 2022, Roth Capital Partners report: After market hours on 1/20, SPWR preannounced Q4’21 results to the downside and detailed the company’s expectations for (1) charges of ~$31mn (~$27mn in Q4’21 and ~$4mn in Q1’22) related to the proactive replacement of third-party connectors experiencing a “cracking issue” for nearly all C&I systems since 2019. . . . Overall thoughts. Given the overall negative sentiment in the sector, look for the stock to be weak. . . . We believe SPWR may need to retrofit ~1,000+ sites representing close to ~9MW (our guesstimate). Downside Q4’21 preannouncement. SPWR reiterated its prior Q4’21 revenue guidance of $361-421mn, but noted that Q4’21 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be at the low end of the previous guidance of $18-41mn. Management attributed the lowered outlook for adjusted EBITDA to (1) $6.5mn of resi EBITDA effectively pushed into 2022 due to weather in California and Covid impacts and (2) an additional $3mn invested in sales and marketing in Q4’21 to expand in “underpenetrated areas nationally.” • January 20, 2022, Truist Securities report: SPWR Addressing 3P Quality Concerns. . . . SPWR has identified a cracking issue in certain connectors within third party commercial equipment supplied to the company. . . . As the company is pursuing the sale of its CIS business, we wouldn’t be surprised if such findings were revealed in a due diligence process, though we note SPWR specifically indicated the issue was identified in a product quality assessment. • January 21, 2022, Cowen Equity Research report: SunPower disclosed a quality issue with some of its commercial equipment. The company noted that a third party connector that was installed at the factory has developed cracking issue. . . . Our sense is this issue needs to be resolved before the intended sale of the C&I division occurs and likely came up in due diligence. In response to the aftermarket January 20, 2022 disclosures, SunPower"

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action against ImmunityBio and certain of its top officials for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) & 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, codified at 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired ImmunityBio securities between March 10, 2021 and May 10, 2023, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were damaged thereby (the “Class”). 2. ImmunityBio, as it now stands, was formed in connection with a merger between two clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies controlled by Defendant Soon- Shiong on March 9, 2021. The combined Company owned a broad portfolio of at least 17 product candidates at various stages of clinical development, including several in late-stage clinical trials. 3. Throughout the Class Period, ImmunityBio’s “lead” product candidate was a cell fusion protein for the treatment of bladder cancer known as Anktiva. By the start of the Class Period, Anktiva yielded impressive results in one of its Phase 3 trials and the Individual Defendants actively planned to file an application to seek marketing approval from the FDA, the first for any product in its development pipeline. As such, ImmunityBio did not generate any meaningful revenues from the commercial sale of any other products, and did not expect to generate any meaningful revenue from the commercial sale of any products unless Anktiva received marketing approval. 4. As seasoned biotech executives, the Individual Defendants were fully aware that their plan for Anktiva meant that ImmunityBio would need to demonstrate in its forthcoming application that the facility which produced Anktiva fully complied with the FDA’s minimum standards for drug manufacturing known as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), and, later, submit to a mid-review inspection by a team of FDA field specialists to observe the facility in use and verify its cGMP status. 5. The FDA’s cGMP requirements are especially important for drugs derived from living materials, like Anktiva. Unlike chemically synthesized drugs, “biologics,” as they are called, often have a complex structure and manufacturing such drugs at scale requires a series of highly-technical steps, each of which must be carefully controlled to ensure a consistent end product free from impurities. Even a small deviation from protocol can have a devastating impact on the composition of the drug and, thus, its safety. For this reason, the FDA is not authorized to approve an application for a new biologic unless it is satisfied from all evidence that it receives, including the findings from the facility inspection, that it is manufactured in accordance with cGMP. 6. In contrast to ImmunityBio’s other “home grown” product candidates that are manufactured in house, Anktiva was acquired from another company that relied on a third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Anktiva, which ImmunityBio continued to use. However, the Individual Defendants repeatedly assured investors that the Company’s manufacturing resources complied with cGMP and even represented that the CMO it used to manufacture Anktiva had robust cGMP standards in place. 7. On or around May 23, 2022, the Company submitted a marketing application for Anktiva to the FDA, and continued to represent that its manufacturing resources, including the CMO that it used to make Anktiva, complied with cGMP. Because new data from the Phase 3 study continued to show a durable treatment effect, the market, including analysts that followed the Company, were led to believe that there were no major impediments to approval—certainly no cGMP issues. 8. Unbeknownst to investors, the facility used by ImmunityBio’s CMO to manufacture Anktiva was plagued by myriad cGMP issues throughout the Class Period. In March and July 2021, the FDA issued a Form 483—an official document that memorializes any serious departures from cGMP—to the site’s management following on-site inspections. Even after that episode, issues continued at the most basic level. The CMO was unable to release manufacturing batch records or close out investigations into critical deviations from established protocols on schedule. It regularly failed to conduct stability tests designed to show that the active ingredient produced there did not undergo unacceptable deterioration over time while in storage. It ran out of “reference material” used as the control against which batch samples were tested. And numerous batches of Anktiva failed for a variety of reasons. 9. With the application for their inaugural product on the line, the Individual Defendants were keenly aware of these recurring issues. Defendant Richard Adcock, ImmunityBio’s Chief Executive Officer, and Leonard Sender, ImmunityBio’s Chief Operating Officer, were meeting with AGC officials on a monthly or bi-monthly basis throughout the Class Period to discuss AGC’s continued delays. 10. In November 2022, the FDA notified the CMO that it would conduct a two week inspection with six inspectors, signaling that the inspection would be more intensive than usual. After learning this, ImmunityBio leadership became very concerned given the history of deficiencies at the plant and asked to hold a mock inspection. Adcock and Sender were intimately involved in all aspects of the mock inspection, which revealed that the facility continued to suffer from rampant cGMP lapses. Because the mock inspection was just weeks before the FDA’s visit, not nearly all of the issues identified could be remediated in time. 11. The FDA inspection, which took place in February 2023, was catastrophic. After the FDA observed numerous violations on the first day of the visit, Defendant Soon-Shiong demanded real-time updates and executive-to-executive calls at the end of each inspection day. Adcock flew overnight to the site to participate in the rest of the inspection. Ultimately, the FDA issued a scathing 15-page Form 483 cataloging a litany of cGMP failings that it both observed while the facility was in operation and that it confirmed by reviewing historic records at the site. The violations were so severe that the FDA ultimately classified the inspection as “Official Action Indicated,” meaning it recommended administrative or enforcement action to remedy the violations. 12. The serious nature of the cGMP violations uncovered by the FDA in connection with its pre-approval inspection and the threat that they posed to patients if not rectified would have been apparent to anyone with experience in world of biotechnology development. They would certainly be obvious to the Individual Defendants, especially industry veteran Soon-Shiong who has a background in medicine and stewarded numerous drugs through the FDA approval process. This Complaint includes the interlocking analysis of a highly qualified expert in the field of FDA compliance, who explains the serious gravity of the cGMP violations throughout the Class Period and concludes that the findings by the FDA during its pre-approval inspection would, at a minimum, result in a recommendation to withhold rather than approve the pending application for Anktiva. 13. Investors, however, were kept in the dark. Shockingly, ImmunityBio continued to represent that its manufacturing resources, including the CMO that it used to make Anktiva, complied with cGMP, even after the FDA’s February 2023 inspection. 14. It was not until May 2023 that investors began to learn the true extent of the manufacturing issues. On the morning of May 11, 2023, ImmunityBio announced that the FDA rejected its application for Anktiva not because of its risk benefit profile or concerns with the clinical studies but, rather, because of deficiencies arising from the pre-approval inspection at its CMO. The stock crashed, shedding over 55% of its market value in a single day. 15. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of ImmunityBio’s securities, Lead Plaintiff and other members of the Class have suffered significant damages. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a). The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78t(a), and pursuant to the rules and regulations duly promulgated thereunder, including SEC Rule 10b-5, codified at 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. 17. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a). ImmunityBio’s principal executive offices are located in this judicial district, Defendants transact business in this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein, including the dissemination of materially false or misleading statements to the public, occurred in this judicial district. 18. In connection with the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendants directly or indirectly used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including, but not limited to, the mails, the facilities of a national securities market, and interstate telephonic and digital communications systems. PARTIES Lead Plaintiff, Dipak Patel purchased or otherwise acquired ImmunityBio securities at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, as set forth in the amended certification attached hereto, and was damaged thereby, as set forth herein. ImmunityBio is a biopharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware with its principal executive offices located at 3530 John Hopkins Court in San Diego, California. The Company’s securities trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol IBRX. Defendant Patrick Soon-Shiong (“Soon-Shiong”) is the founder and CEO of one of the companies involved in the formation of what is now known as ImmunityBio. He has held the role of Executive Chairman of ImmunityBio’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) since October 2020, and served as ImmunityBio’s Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer since the position was created for him in August 2021. He previously served as Chairman of the Board and CEO of the predecessor to ImmunityBio from March 2015 to October 2020. The release announcing Soon- Shiong’s appointment as Executive Chairman stated that he will “continue to play a key, active role in [ImmunityBio]’s business and in the development of the company’s long- term business strategy.” Defendant Richard Adcock (“Adcock”) has served as ImmunityBio’s CEO since Soon-Shiong stepped down from that position in October 2020 and as a member of its Board since March 2021. In the release announcing Adcock’s appointment as CEO, Soon-Shiong stated that he had “worked with him [Adcock] for several years” in previous capacities and that “I intend to work closely with him” moving forward. Defendant David Sachs (“Sachs”) has served as ImmunityBio’s CFO since its inception in March 2021. He previously held different executive positions at various companies controlled by Soon-Shiong and/or their subsidiaries since 2011. For ease of reference, Defendants Soon-Shiong, Adcock, and Sachs are referred to herein as the “Individual Defendants.” THE CONFIDENTIAL WITNESSES Confidential Witness 1 (“CW1”) worked for the Company since January CW1 initially worked at NantKwest as a Senior Specialist, Quality Control Analytics from January 2021 to January 2022.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This case involves fraudulent accounting treatment of approximately $2.2 million in shipping expenses that led to materially misleading financial statements being filed with the Commission and made available to the investing public. Furniture retailer and publicly traded company (sometimes referred to as an “issuer” of securities) Lovesac, its former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Executive Vice President, Donna Dellomo, and its former Controller and Vice President, Yoon Um, failed to properly account for “last mile” shipping expenses, i.e., the cost of shipping finished products from Lovesac’s distribution centers to its customers. Dellomo and Um instead engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obscure the expenses in the company’s books and records. In April 2023, Lovesac discovered that $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses were not properly recorded and reported in its previously published financial results for the periods in which they were incurred. The $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses had instead been inaccurately recorded in the Company’s books and records for the first quarter of fiscal year Um, in concert with Dellomo, engaged in a scheme to hide those expenses from investors and the Commission. They did this to avoid missing Lovesac’s projected gross margin—an important financial metric that the Company disclosed in its SEC filings and on conference calls that are open to investors where the Company discusses financial and other issues (often referred to as “earnings calls,” which are frequently attended by financial analysts covering the Company)—and to avoid restating the Company’s prior financial filings for the periods in which the expenses were incurred. To accomplish this scheme, Dellomo and Um improperly accounted for the expenses. Dellomo and Um, both experienced financial professionals and certified public accountants (“CPA”), knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the fraudulent accounting treatment they devised was not compliant with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and rendered certain of Lovesac’s financial statements materially false and misleading. As part of the scheme, Dellomo also submitted a false and misleading management representation letter to Lovesac’s outside auditor and otherwise failed to alert Lovesac’s auditors to the fraudulent accounting for the $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses. Further, Lovesac and Dellomo failed to implement sufficient internal controls over financial reporting—that is, processes, policies and procedures put in place by a company to provide reasonable assurances as to the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of its financial reporting—that may have prevented or detected Dellomo and Um’s fraudulent accounting. In the end, Lovesac was required to restate its financial statements for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to correct Dellomo and Um’s fraud. As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Lovesac violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Dellomo violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, thereunder. Dellomo also aided and abetted Lovesac’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Um violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder. Um also aided and abetted Dellomo’s violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and Lovesac’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)]. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Defendants, enjoining them from engaging in the unlawful conduct alleged in this Complaint, and civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)]. The Commission further seeks an order prohibiting Dellomo and Um from acting as officers or directors of any public company pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(2)], an order barring Dellomo and Um from practicing as accountants before the Commission, and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78aa]. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. Certain of the acts, practices, and transactions and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred within the District of Connecticut and elsewhere, and were effected, directly or indirectly, by making use of means or instrumentalities of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails. DEFENDANTS Lovesac, a furniture retailer, is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Stamford, Connecticut. Lovesac became a public company through an initial public offering in 2018. The Company’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on Nasdaq under the symbol “LOVE.” Lovesac files periodic reports with the Commission on Forms 10-K (annual financial statements), 8-K (current reports), and 10-Q (quarterly financial statements), among others. During the relevant period, Lovesac issued stock compensation to employees pursuant to a stock incentive plan for which a Form S-8 registration statement was filed with the Commission on July 8, Further, on June 26, 2023, Lovesac issued shares pursuant to the exercise of certain stock warrants. Donna Dellomo, age 60, is a resident of Williamsburg, Virginia. Dellomo has been licensed as a CPA since 1991 and is currently licensed in New York. Between January and June 2023, Dellomo served as Lovesac’s Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President and oversaw finance, accounting, administration and risk management, and legal departments at the Company. She retired from Lovesac in June 2023. After retiring, Dellomo worked as a strategic consultant for Lovesac for a year through June 2024. Yoon Um, age 41, is a resident of Athens, New York. Um has been licensed as a CPA since 2009 and is currently licensed in New York. She was employed as Lovesac’s Controller and Vice President starting in November 2022 and agreed to resign in July 2023. Prior to serving as Lovesac’s Controller, Um was a Controller at another public company for two years and spent almost a decade in various auditing roles at a large public accounting firm before that. FACTS Lovesac’s Business Lovesac is a furniture company that designs, manufactures, and sells furniture comprised of modular couches called Sactionals and foam beanbag chairs called Sacs, as well as accessories. The Company markets its products primarily through its website and showrooms at malls throughout the United States. The Company operates through a direct-to-consumer model selling its products online and shipping directly to customers. The Company went public on June 26, 2018, with an initial offering priced at $16.00 per share. The Company’s common stock trades on Nasdaq under the Symbol “LOVE.” Lovesac’s Finance and Accounting Group At all relevant times, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group was led by the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Donna Dellomo. Dellomo, an experienced financial professional and CPA, began her career as an auditor at various companies, and subsequently served as an accounting manager, corporate Controller, and CFO of another public company. Beginning in 2017, Dellomo served as Lovesac’s CFO, initially working to help prepare the Company for its initial public offering in 2018. During the relevant period, Dellomo’s direct reports included Um (the Company’s Controller), who was hired in November and oversaw the Company’s accounting functions. During her ten months as Lovesac’s Controller, Um and her reports were responsible for internal accounting functions. Um agreed to resign in July 2023 and left the Company in September 2023. Glossary of Relevant Accounting Terminology Fiscal Year: A public company’s fiscal year (“FY”) is the twelve-month period in which a company reports quarterly and annual financial results. Lovesac operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to February 1st. The Company reports financial results on this schedule to account for increased sales during the November to January holiday season. FY 2023 was 52 weeks and ended on January 29, 2023, and FY 2024 was 53 weeks and ended on February 4, 2024. A public company’s annual financial results based on the fiscal year are publicly reported on SEC Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) filed with the Commission, as required by law. Fiscal Quarter: Public companies also report quarterly results for the four three- month quarters in each fiscal year. Lovesac’s FY 2023 quarters consisted of the first quarter (or “Q1”) (February through April), the second quarter (or “Q2”) (May through July), the third quarter (or “Q3”) (August through October), and the fourth quarter (or “Q4”) (November through January). Quarterly financial results are often publicly reported in a SEC Form 8-K (“Form 8-K”) filed with the Commission and, for the first three quarters of the year, additionally reported on SEC Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) filed with the Commission, as required by law. Q4 results are incorporated into the annual Form 10-K. GAAP: GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States) refers to the standard framework of guidelines for accounting used in the United States as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These principles set the rules for preparing, presenting, and reporting financial statements of public companies, ensuring consistency, and transparency. GAAP is used by accountants, auditors, and the investing public to compare financial information across different organizations, maintaining uniformity in financial reporting. Required financial statements, such as Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, must be prepared in accordance with GAAP. If such financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, they are presumed to be misleading or inaccurate. Accrual: An “accrual” reflects revenue earned or expenses incurred before the actual cash transaction has taken place. An accrual for a shipping expense would reflect a shipping expense incurred (i.e., when a product has been shipped by FedEx) but that has not yet been paid by the company. Gross margin: Gross margin is a financial metric that represents the difference between net sales (net sales refers to the sale of merchandise plus shipping and handling revenue less returns and discounts) and cost of merchandise sold and is expressed as a percentage of net sales. A higher gross margin indicates that a company is retaining more of its revenue after covering the direct costs associated with producing goods. For example, if a company sold ten widgets for $100 each and all the direct costs were $40 per widget, the gross margin would be 60%, meaning that the company retained $600 or 60% of the net sales. Capitalization: Capitalization is an accounting concept that refers to the process of recording an expenditure as an asset rather than an expense. When an expense is capitalized, the underlying expense is spread out over the useful life of the asset instead of the full cost being recorded in the company’s books and records and reported in its financial statements (sometimes referred to as revenue being “recognized”). Capitalization is applied to expenditures that provide future economic benefits under certain circumstances. For example, a company may capitalize the cost of manufacturing machinery that will allow the company to manufacture products over time. Through capitalizing such costs, companies match the cost of an asset with the revenue that it generates over time. This contrasts with expenses that do not provide a future economic benefit, such as outbound shipping costs, that are recorded in the period in which the expenses were incurred and the revenue recognized. Amortization: Amortization refers to the financial concept of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. This process records the cost of the asset over the period it is expected to generate economic benefits. Thus, for example, a company might divide the cost of an intangible asset, such as a patent, over the useful life of the patent. In this example, if the patent was expected to generate revenue from sales of a patented invention for ten years, the cost of the patent would be spread out over the same ten-year period. General Ledger: The general ledger is a record of a company’s financial transactions, where all journal entries are recorded. A journal entry is the initial record of each of the company’s transactions, detailing the date, accounts affected, amounts, and a brief description. These journal entries are “posted” to the general ledger, which organizes them by account (such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses) and serves as the foundation for preparing a company’s financial statements, such as the balance sheet and income statement. Last Mile Shipping “Last mile shipping” is the term used by Lovesac to reflect the cost of transporting Lovesac’s finished products from a distribution center to the customer. At all relevant times, Lovesac used large shipping companies like FedEx for its last mile shipping. With respect to last mile shipping expenses, Lovesac publicly disclosed in its FY Form 10-K that it “records the expenses for shipping and handling activities at the same time the Company recognizes revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of merchandise sold and include inbound freight and tariff costs relative to inventory sold, warehousing, and last mile shipping to our customers.” As set forth below, Lovesac’s accounting for last mile shipping expenses was inconsistent with this public disclosure, as was Dellomo and Um’s scheme to hide last mile shipping expenses. On average, there was at least a two-week delay between the shipping date (the date when a product was shipped by FedEx) and the invoice date (the date when the FedEx invoice was received by Lovesac). Lovesac accounted for this timing discrepancy through an accrual process whereby the Company calculated and recorded a monthly estimate of shipping expenses incurred, but not yet recorded in its books and records. The accrual was later reconciled against actual amounts paid to shipping companies based on invoices. However, during the relevant period, Lovesac’s monthly accrual methodology was flawed and inconsistently applied. In certain circumstances, relevant shipment data for the period was not used in the shipping container count estimate and improper assumptions were used for the cost per shipment calculation. As a result, the estimated accrual was understated, which was not compliant with GAAP because the expenses incurred in the period were not properly recorded. Dellomo and Um Devised a Scheme to Obscure the Last Mile Shipping Expenses in Lovesac’s Q1 2024 Books While performing an analysis in April 2023 as part of Lovesac’s monthly financial closing process, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group employees discovered that last mile shipping expenses were significantly higher in Q1 2024 than what the Company had previously budgeted for the month. Specifically, Lovesac’s finance and accounting group employees estimated that approximately $2.2 million of last mile shipping expenses were improperly recorded in Q1 2024 rather than having been recorded in FY 2023, the period in which they believed the expenses were actually incurred. On Sunday, April 23, 2023, Dellomo, in an email to employees including members of the finance and accounting group, indicated that the out-of-period shipping expenses would cause Lovesac’s gross margin for Q1 2024 to be lower than expected. As explained above, gross margin is a financial metric, and a higher gross margin figure is more positive for a company. In the same email, Dellomo expressed concern about not meeting Lovesac’s 50.1% gross margin projection, which had been publicly disclosed by Lovesac during a March 28, 2023 earnings call. Minutes later, Dellomo forwarded her email to Um and requested that she investigate the issue. The next day, Monday, April 24, 2023, members of Lovesac’s finance and accounting group met to discuss the problem with last mile shipping expenses having been improperly recorded in Q1 2024. On April 25, 2023, Dellomo emailed Um and the same group, noting that the gross margin estimate for Q1 2024 was, as of that day, only 48.7%. This was 140 basis points lower than Lovesac’s Q1 2024 gross margin projection of 50.1%, which, as noted above, was publicly disclosed to investors during the March 28, 2023 earnings call. On or about Tuesday, April 25, 2023, Um and other members of Lovesac’s finance and accounting group concluded that there were approximately $2.2 million of last mile shipping invoices for shipping expenses incurred in FY 2023 that were not recorded until Q1 On the same day, members of the finance and accounting group, including Dellomo and Um, discussed the $2.2 million out-of-period expenses and the impact on Lovesac’s gross margin for Q1 2024. Um stated in a Microsoft Teams chat that she could not justify, as an accounting matter, reversing the $2.2 million shipping expenses. Another finance and accounting group employee who reported to Um communicated to her that reversing the $2.2 million from the Q1 2024 books would be “a giant black eye for the auditors to pick out.” Also on April 25, Um communicated with a senior member of Lovesac’s financial planning and analysis (“FP&A”) group. Um told that individual, in a Microsoft Teams chat, that the only way to meet the Q1 2024 gross margin projection was to capitalize the $2.2 million last mile shipping expenses and amortize them evenly over the remaining three quarters of FY 2024 starting in Q2 2024. Um replied: “I just don’t know how I can support [it].” Indeed, capitalizing the $2.2 million in shipping expenses would not comply with GAAP because the expenses did not provide any future economic benefit.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Complaint against Defendants Binance Holdings Limited (“Binance”), BAM Trading Services Inc. (“BAM Trading”), BAM Management US Holdings Inc. (“BAM Management”), and Changpeng Zhao (“Zhao”), alleges as follows: SUMMARY This case arises from Defendants’ blatant disregard of the federal securities laws and the investor and market protections these laws provide. In so doing, Defendants have enriched themselves by billions of U.S. dollars while placing investors’ assets at significant risk. Defendants have unlawfully solicited U.S. investors to buy, sell, and trade crypto asset securities through unregistered trading platforms available online at Binance.com (“Binance.com Platform”) and Binance.US (“Binance.US Platform”) (collectively, “Binance Platforms”). Defendants have engaged in multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities and other investment schemes. And Defendants BAM Trading and BAM Management defrauded equity, retail, and institutional investors about purported surveillance and controls over manipulative trading on the Binance.US Platform, which were in fact virtually non-existent. First, Binance and BAM Trading, under Zhao’s leadership and control, have unlawfully offered three essential securities market functions—exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency—on the Binance Platforms without registering with the SEC. Acutely aware that U.S. law requires registration for these functions, Defendants nevertheless chose not to register, so they could evade the critical regulatory oversight designed to protect investors and markets. Second, Binance and BAM Trading have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities, including Binance’s own crypto assets called “BNB” and “BUSD,” as well as Binance’s profit-generating programs called “BNB Vault” and “Simple Earn,” and a so-called “staking” investment scheme available on the Binance.US Platform. In so doing, they have deprived investors of material information, including the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in these securities. Third, BAM Trading and BAM Management have made misrepresentations to investors about controls they claimed to have implemented on the Binance.US Platform, while raising approximately $200 million from private investors in BAM Management and attracting billions of dollars in trading volume from investors (including retail and institutional investors) seeking to transact on the Binance.US Platform. Starting in or around 2018, determined to escape the registration requirements of the federal securities laws, Defendants—under Zhao’s control—designed and implemented a multi-step plan to surreptitiously evade U.S. laws. As Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer (“Binance CCO”) admitted, “we do not want [Binance].com to be regulated ever.” As one part of this plan to evade United States regulatory oversight over Zhao, Binance, and the Binance.com Platform, Zhao and Binance created BAM Management and BAM Trading in the United States and claimed publicly that these entities independently controlled the operation of the Binance.US Platform. Behind the scenes, however, Zhao and Binance were intimately involved in directing BAM Trading’s U.S. business operations and providing and maintaining the crypto asset services of the Binance.US Platform. BAM Trading employees referred to Zhao’s and Binance’s control of BAM Trading’s operations as “shackles” that often prevented BAM Trading employees from understanding and freely conducting the business of running and operating the Binance.US Platform—so much so that, by November 2020, BAM Trading’s then-CEO told Binance’s CFO that her “entire team feels like [it had] been duped into being a puppet.” As a second part of Zhao’s and Binance’s plan to shield themselves from U.S. regulation, they consistently claimed to the public that the Binance.com Platform did not serve U.S. persons, while simultaneously concealing their efforts to ensure that the most valuable U.S. customers continued trading on the platform. When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, Binance announced that it was implementing controls to block U.S. customers from the Binance.com Platform. In reality, Binance did the opposite. Zhao directed Binance to assist certain high-value U.S. customers in circumventing those controls and to do so surreptitiously because—as Zhao himself acknowledged—Binance did not want to “be held accountable” for these actions. As the Binance CCO explained, “[o]n the surface we cannot be seen to have US users[,] but in reality, we should get them through other creative means.” Indeed, Zhao’s stated “goal” was “to reduce the losses to ourselves, and at the same time to make the U.S. regulatory authorities not trouble us.” Defendants’ purposeful efforts to evade U.S. regulatory oversight while simultaneously providing securities-related services to U.S. customers put the safety of billions of dollars of U.S. investor capital at risk and at Binance’s and Zhao’s mercy. Lacking regulatory oversight, Defendants were free to and did transfer investors’ crypto and fiat assets as Defendants pleased, at times commingling and diverting them in ways that properly registered brokers, dealers, exchanges, and clearing agencies would not have been able to do. For example, through accounts owned and controlled by Zhao and Binance, billions of U.S. dollars of customer funds from both Binance Platforms were commingled in an account held by a Zhao- controlled entity (called Merit Peak Limited), which funds were subsequently transferred to a third party apparently in connection with the purchase and sale of crypto assets. Moreover, Defendants understood the importance to crypto asset investors of implementing trading surveillance and controls over crypto trading platforms. Zhao himself stated in 2019 that “CREDIBILITY is the most important asset for any exchange! If an exchange fakes their volumes, would you trust them with your funds?” Defendants BAM Trading and BAM Management touted the surveillance and controls supposedly in place to prevent manipulative trading on the Binance.US Platform. But Defendants failed to implement on the Binance.US Platform the trade surveillance or manipulative trading controls BAM Trading and BAM Management touted to investors. Thus, Defendants failed to satisfy basic requirements of registered exchanges—to have rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and the capacity to carry out that purpose. The supposed controls were virtually non-existent, and those that did exist did not monitor for or protect against “wash trading” or self-dealing, which was occurring on the Binance.US Platform. Most notably, from at least September 2019 until June 2022, Sigma Chain AG (“Sigma Chain”), a trading firm owned and controlled by Zhao, engaged in wash trading that artificially inflated the trading volume of crypto asset securities on the Binance.US Platform. Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) in part to provide for the regulation of the offer and sale of securities and the national securities markets through registration and attendant disclosure, recordkeeping, inspection, and conflict-of-interest mitigation requirements. Binance and BAM Trading—both under Zhao’s control—have engaged and continue to engage in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities, effecting unregistered crypto asset securities transactions on the Binance Platforms, combining core securities market functions while purposefully evading registration, and operating while impaired by obvious conflicts of interest. In doing so, they have dodged the disclosure and other requirements that Congress and the SEC have constructed over the course of decades to protect our capital markets and investors and thereby have violated—and continue to violate—the law. VIOLATIONS By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, Binance and BAM Trading engaged in, and are currently engaging in, the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)]. By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, Binance acted as an exchange, broker and dealer, and clearing agency for the Binance.com Platform without registering in any such capacities, in violation of Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78e, 78o(a), and 78q-1(b)]. Similarly, with respect to the Binance.US Platform, Binance acted together with BAM Trading as an exchange, BAM Trading acted as a broker, and Binance and BAM Trading each acted as a clearing agency, without registering in any such capacities, in violation of Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78e, 78o(a), and 78q-1(b)]. As a control person over Binance and BAM Trading under Exchange Act Section 20(a) [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)], Zhao has also violated Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78e, 78o(a), and 78q-1(b)] for Binance and BAM Trading’s violations with respect to both Binance Platforms. By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, BAM Trading and BAM Management have further obtained money or property by means of materially false and misleading statements and engaged in transactions, practices, and courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon purchasers in the offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2) and 77q(a)(3)]. Unless Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, there is a reasonable likelihood that they will continue to engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts, practices, and courses of business of similar type and object in violation of the federal securities laws. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a)]. The Commission seeks a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining Defendants from committing further violations of the federal securities laws they are alleged to have violated; (b) ordering Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest; (c) permanently enjoining Defendants and any entity controlled by them from, directly or indirectly, using the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to: (i) participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including any crypto asset security, in any unregistered transaction; (ii) act as an unregistered exchange with respect to any securities, including any crypto asset securities; (iii) act as an unregistered broker or dealer with respect to any securities, including any crypto asset securities; and (iv) act as an unregistered clearing agency with respect to any securities, including any crypto asset securities; (d) imposing civil money penalties on Defendants; and (e) ordering equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a)]. Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, including Defendants’ regular use of the Internet and the U.S. banking system, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. Venue is proper in the District of Columbia pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)]. Among other acts, Defendants failed to register with the SEC in this District as an exchange, broker-dealer, or clearing agency as required under the Exchange Act. In addition, they failed to register with the SEC in this District the offer and sale of securities, and they conducted unregistered offers and sales of securities to residents of, or persons located in, this District. Defendants also transacted business in this District. At least before September 2019, Binance (as controlled by Zhao) made the Binance.com Platform available for trading to customers in this District. Further, BAM Management and BAM Trading (also under Zhao’s and Binance’s control) obtained District of Columbia business licenses and transacted business in this District, including through the operation and availability of the Binance.US Platform, which was accessed by individuals in the District, and through personnel (such as one of its CEOs) in this District, who provided services to and engaged in business with all Defendants. Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint occurred within the United States and had a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States. Binance and Zhao actively solicited U.S. investors to trade on the Binance Platforms. Binance and Zhao, for example, regularly solicited U.S. investors via their social media and other internet postings to trade on both of the Binance Platforms. Zhao also directed other Binance employees to actively solicit and take other steps to retain U.S. investors on the Binance.com Platform, even after Binance publicly announced in June 2019 that it would no longer serve U.S. investors. By then, Binance estimated that it had over 1.47 million U.S.-based investors on the Binance.com Platform, and it continued to maintain a substantial U.S. customer base for several years thereafter. In addition, Binance has employees located in the United States, and residents of this District invested in schemes Binance offered and sold as securities including BUSD and the Simple Earn program. Moreover, until at least the end of 2022, Binance, at Zhao’s direction, maintained custody and control of the crypto assets deposited, held, traded, and/or accrued by customers on the Binance.US Platform. DEFENDANTS The Binance Platforms were founded and are maintained and operated by an opaque web of corporate entities, including those identified below, all of which are beneficially owned and controlled by Zhao, Binance’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and, at least through March 2022, the Chairman of BAM Trading’s and BAM Management’s Boards of Directors. Binance, d/b/a Binance.com, is a Cayman Islands limited liability company founded and owned by Zhao. Since at least July 2017, it has operated the Binance.com Platform, an international crypto asset trading platform. The Binance.com Platform markets itself as being available to customers in more than 100 countries. It currently offers trading in over 350 crypto assets and makes available various other investment opportunities involving crypto assets, including crypto asset securities. Binance operates through a number of subordinate or affiliated entities, in multiple jurisdictions, all tied to Zhao as the beneficial owner. Zhao has been publicly dismissive of “traditional mentalities” about corporate formalities and their attendant regulatory requirements. He has refused to identify the headquarters of Binance, claiming, “Wherever I sit is the Binance office. Wherever I meet somebody is going to be the Binance office.” According to Zhao, the concept of a formal corporate entity with a headquarters and its own bank account is unnecessary: “All of those things doesn’t have to exist for blockchain companies.” Notably, however, billions of dollars from the platforms flowed through dozens of Binance and Zhao-owned U.S.-based bank accounts. Neither Binance nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities have ever been registered with the SEC in any capacity. BAM Management is a Delaware corporation and the parent of BAM Trading and other affiliated entities. When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, BAM Management was wholly owned by BAM Management Company Limited, a Cayman Islands company, which in turn was wholly owned by CPZ Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company that was owned and controlled by Zhao. Presently, Zhao continues to own 81 percent of BAM Management. Neither BAM Management nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities (including BAM Trading) has ever been registered with the SEC in any capacity. BAM Trading, d/b/a Binance.US, is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida. It is wholly owned by BAM Management. BAM Trading holds 43 money transmitter licenses with U.S. jurisdictions, including this District. Zhao, widely known as “CZ,” is a Canadian citizen who resides outside of the United States, is Binance’s founder, beneficial owner, and CEO, and was Chairman of BAM Trading’s and BAM Management’s Boards of Directors at least until approximately March 2022. Zhao also owns several entities that have regularly traded on the Binance Platforms. Between October 2022 and January 2023, Zhao personally received $62.5 million from one of the Binance bank accounts. Zhao has never been associated with any entity registered with the SEC. CERTAIN OTHER ENTITIES Trust Company A is a New York limited purpose trust company. Beginning in September 2019, pursuant to a “Stablecoin as a Service” agreement with a Binance affiliate, Trust Company A issued in partnership with Binance the crypto asset “BUSD,” which was approved by and under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”). BUSD is a Binance-branded U.S. Dollar denominated crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain. In December 2019, BAM Trading entered into a partnership with Trust Company A, whereby Trust Company A provided certain services with respect to BUSD purchases and sales on the Binance.US Platform. Effective February 21, 2023, Trust Company A ceased issuing new BUSD pursuant to an NYDFS order. Trust Company B is a Nevada-based trust company. In or around July 2019, BAM Trading entered into an agreement with Trust Company B to provide certain services to customers purchasing crypto assets on the Binance.US Platform with U.S. dollars. Sigma Chain is a crypto asset trading firm incorporated in Switzerland. Zhao is Sigma Chain’s beneficial owner, and several Binance employees conducted its operations. Among others, Binance’s back office manager (“Binance Back Office Manager”) was Sigma Chain’s President at the same time she also had signatory authority over BAM Trading’s bank accounts. Sigma Chain was an active trader on both Binance Platforms, and described itself as “the main market maker for Binance.com.” Upon the Binance.US Platform’s launch, Zhao directed that Sigma Chain be one of its first market makers. Further, since the Binance.US Platform began offering over-the-counter (“OTC”) trading and its Convert Trading and One Click Buy Sell (“OCBS”) Services to customers, Sigma Chain has served as one of the counterparties to Binance.US Platform customers, including, at times, serving as the only counterparty. Merit Peak Limited (“Merit Peak”) is a crypto asset trading firm incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Zhao is Merit Peak’s beneficial owner, and several Binance employees conducted its operations. It has described itself as “a proprietary firm trading with our owner’s [Zhao’s] self-made wealth from the digital asset business.” Merit Peak was an OTC trading service provider on the Binance.com Platform and was one of the earliest market makers on the Binance.US Platform. Through Merit Peak, Zhao has also directed over $16 million to BAM Management to fund the Binance.US Platform’s operations.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"The complaint is a securities class action filed by the Trustees of the Welfare and Pension Funds of Local 464A, et al. (\\\"Plaintiffs\\\"), against Danaher Corporation (\\\"Danaher\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\") and certain of its top officials for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Danaher securities between January 27, 2022, and October 23, 2023, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were damaged thereby (the “Class”). Danaher is a conglomerate which owns various operating companies that design, manufacture, and market professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services worldwide. The Company is comprised of more than 17 operating companies organized under three reporting segments: Biotechnology; Life Sciences; and Diagnostics. In 2020 and 2021, Danaher’s diagnostic tests and life sciences equipment were widely used in the effort to combat COVID-19. Specifically, Danaher’s diagnostics segment included Cepheid, a leader in molecular testing, and its life sciences segment included several companies that provided products and services, including sophisticated lab-grade equipment, used by customers to develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. As a result, Danaher experienced explosive revenue growth during this period, and its stock price nearly tripled, reaching an all-time high of $332.43 per share on September 3, 2021. By the beginning of 2022 it was apparent to Danaher as well as the broader financial community that COVID-19, which helped propel the Company to new heights, would soon turn endemic and demand for COVID-related products would dissipate. Investors, like Plaintiffs, were keen to understand the health of Danaher’s business without the amplification provided by the COVID-19 pandemic, including, in particular, the arm responsible for manufactured equipment and components used by biopharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and other therapeutics, known as the “bioprocessing” branch of Danaher’s Life Sciences reporting segment. By the start of 2022, this single business division had grown to become a $7.5 billion franchise. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants declared that there would be enduring demand for products supporting the development of treatments for COVID-19, and the bioprocessing business’ far larger non-COVID product offerings provided a robust runway for long-term growth. They reasoned that the business was healthy by citing increasing sales, dismissed concerns expressed by analysts about shifting market dynamics, and issued ambitious forecasts for the business, which projected the image of sustained growth in both 2022 and 2023. Behind the scenes, the bioprocessing business was unraveling and Defendants knew it. Among other things, customers in the biopharmaceutical industry began to temper their pursuit of COVID-related projects as the population at large began to accept COVID-19 as an endemic disease. In addition, large pharmaceutical customers continued to receive equipment in response to orders placed months earlier during the peak of the pandemic due to the extensive lead times caused by the global supply chain disruption. But having just emerged from a supply crisis, these customers decided to stockpile this inventory rather than cancel the orders in order to put the equipment toward other projects and, effectively, prevent the need to place orders in the future. In addition, smaller startups in early-stage development which traditionally relied on external sources to fund their projects no longer had the same access to funding that they did during the pandemic as interest rates rose, and began to prioritize projects in order to conserve cash. Together, these developments had a catastrophic impact on the bioprocessing business, particularly as they sustained through 2022 and 2023. Unfortunately, investors like Plaintiffs, did not find out until it was too late. Rather than admit that there was a sales cliff looming for the bioprocessing business, Defendants made piecemeal revisions to their public forecasts over the Class Period, ultimately reducing the projections from impressive year-on-year growth to year-over-year declines across the board. Each of these announcements was followed by a significant stock drop as the truth leaked out. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiffs and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a). The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78t(a), and the rules and regulations duly promulgated thereunder, including SEC Rule 10b-5, codified at 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a). At all relevant times, Danaher maintained its principal executive offices at 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 800W, Washington, D.C., located in this judicial district. Defendants therefore transact business in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein, including the dissemination of materially false and misleading statements to the investing public, occurred in this judicial district. In connection with the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendants directly or indirectly used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including, but not limited to, the mails, the facilities of a national securities market, and interstate telephonic and digital communications systems. PARTIES Plaintiffs acquired Danaher securities at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, as set forth in the Certifications previously filed with the Court (ECF Nos. 1-1, 17-3), and were damaged thereby, as set forth herein. Defendant Danaher is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located at 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Suite 800W in Washington, D.C. Danaher’s securities trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under various ticker symbols beginning with the prefix DHR, including the standalone ticker symbol DHR for its common stock. Defendant Rainer M. Blair (“Blair”) has served as Danaher’s President and CEO and as a member of Danaher’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) since September 2020. Prior to that, he held a series of leadership roles, including as Executive Vice President of Danaher’s Life Sciences segment from January 2017 to September 2020. Defendant Matthew R. McGrew (“McGrew”) has served as Danaher’s CFO since January 2019. Prior to that, he served in a series of roles of increasing responsibility in several departments, including investor relations. In his capacity as CFO, McGrew was and is responsible for financial strategy, planning, and management across all of Danaher’s portfolio companies. Defendant Emmanuel Ligner (“Ligner”) has served as Vice President and Group Executive of the Biotechnology reporting segment since it was established in September 2022, and as President and CEO of Cytiva since it was acquired by Danaher in March 2020. Prior to that, he held a series of roles with increasing responsibility at the predecessor to Cytiva, GE Life Sciences, including President and CEO from January 2016 to March 2020, and Group Executive of the bioprocessing division in Life Sciences from March 2020 until the formation of the Biotechnology reporting segment in September 2022. For ease of reference, Defendants Blair, McGrew, and Ligner and are referred to herein as the “Individual Defendants.” THE CONFIDENTIAL WITNESSES Confidential Witness #1 (“CW1”) worked at Danaher as Manager, Internal Communications from March 2021 to August 2022 and as Global Senior Manager, Internal Communications from August 2022 to July 2023. In these roles, CW1 supported internal communications for various groups within Danaher, including senior executives. CW1 reported to CW4, Senior Director, Internal Communications. Among other responsibilities, CW1 had direct contact with Defendant Blair, helping him prepare for town halls each quarter for corporate staff via Microsoft Teams. In connection with this activity, CW1 reviewed operating results and financial metrics with Blair in advance of the town hall. Confidential Witness #2 (“CW2”) was a Global Financial Analyst at the water quality division in the EAS segment from September 2014 to February 2022.

As Senior Director of Internal Communications, CW4 led the internal communications team that supported enterprise-wide employee communications. Among other responsibilities, CW4 supported C-suite executives on internal messaging and communications. In this position, CW4 reported to then-Vice President of Communications, Meghan Britt, who reported to Chief Human Resources Officer, Georgann Couchara, who, in turn, reported directly to Defendant Blair. SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS Overview of the Company and Its Business Headquartered in Washington, D.C., Danaher is a diversified global conglomerate organized around several strategic platforms. At present, the Company is comprised of at least seventeen largely independent operating companies in the areas of Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Diagnostics. As such, it claims to be a leading science and technology company. Danaher was founded in 1984 by brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales when they took over a real estate investment trust (REIT) left behind by their father, Norman Rales, as a vehicle for corporate takeovers. It quietly grew into an industrial giant through steady acquisitions and divestitures in different fields of business. It entered the life sciences sector with the acquisition of Leica Microsystems in 2005. By 2015, the Company’s portfolio included approximately 40 companies across a range of reporting segments, including Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Dental, Test and Measurement, Environmental, and Industrial Technologies. At that time, Danaher generated approximately $19.9 billion in annual revenue, approximately 36% of which was collectively attributable to its Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolios. Danaher’s Transformation Into a Science and Technology Company Beginning in 2015, the Company completed a series of blockbuster transactions to grow its Life Sciences segment. For example, in August 2015, it acquired Pall Corporation (“Pall”), a manufacturer of filtration, separation, and purification tools, for almost $14 billion. In March 2020, it also acquired General Electric Company’s biopharmaceutical support business, known as GE Life Sciences, for over $21 billion and renamed it “Cytiva.” Together, Pall and Cytiva broadened Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio to include a full suite of systems and products used to manufacture drugs derived from living materials, known as “biologics,” at all phases of the production process from cell culture through packaging, including “downstream” filtration in which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is separated from extraneous byproducts. In addition, in April 2019, the Company also acquired nucleic acid and genomic product pioneer, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (“IDT”), for approximately $2 billion. During this period, Danaher also took steps to expand its Diagnostics platform. Most notably, in November 2016, it acquired publicly-traded molecular testing company, Cepheid, for approximately $4 billion. Cepheid already had an established presence at healthcare institutions throughout the world as a result of its proprietary testing system, GeneXpert, which tests for pathogens and genetic disorders by placing a sample into a single use cartridge and loading it into a desktop machine that runs a fully-automated polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) test. Throughout this time, Danaher also exited several business areas to streamline the composition of its asset portfolio. For example, in connection with the Pall acquisition, Danaher spun off the businesses in its Test & Measurements and Industrial Technologies segments into a standalone, publicly-traded company named Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”). In addition, in late 2019, the Company also completed the spinoff of its Dental segment into an independent, publicly- traded company named Envista Holdings Corporation (“Envista”). By the start of 2020, Danaher transformed into a business with just three reporting segments: Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental and Applied Solutions (“EAS”). At that time, the Company generated approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, approximately 39% of which was attributable to its Life Sciences segment and approximately 37% of which was attributable to its Diagnostics segment. In other words, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics branches accounted for 76% of Danaher’s annual revenues, up from 36% at the start of 2015. On May 6, 2020, Danaher announced that it selected Defendant Rainer M. Blair, head of the Company’s Life Sciences platform, to succeed Thomas P. Joyce Jr. as CEO of Danaher. In his role as head of the Life Sciences portfolio, Blair led a number of key acquisitions, including Pall, IDT, and Cytiva, and oversaw the growth of the Life Sciences platform from a business generating approximately $2.4 billion in annual revenue in 2015 to approximately $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2019. According to CW1, and based on CW1’s role as leader in internal communications at Danaher, Defendant Blair wanted to develop Danaher into a brand leader in the life science and genomics space and set on a course to do so. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business In contrast to many other businesses that suffered from the sea change in consumer spending patterns, Danaher’s Diagnostic and Life Sciences segments were uniquely positioned to profit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, in vitro diagnostic tests, i.e., diagnostic tests that use samples taken from the human body, must be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) before they can be introduced into interstate commerce for commercial purposes. The FDA is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the HHS, Alex M. Azar II, determined that there was a public health emergency with the significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad related to the novel COVID-19 virus and, on that basis, decided that circumstances exist justifying emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for COVID-19. See 85 Fed. Reg. 7316 (Feb. 4, 2020). Under applicable law, this provided the FDA with the power to issue emergency use authorization (each an “EUA”) permitting the sale and use of unapproved tests for the diagnosis or detection of the virus causing COVID-19 under certain circumstances. Thus, the HHS Secretary’s February 4, 2020 EUA authorization provided a significant business opportunity for companies involved in the creation of such devices by providing a pathway to go directly to market with a product in very high demand without the need to engage in the costly steps of clinical development or traditional premarket regulatory approval. At the time of the HHS Secretary’s EUA authorization for COVID-19, IDT offered a selection of bespoke genomic products, including custom primers and probes used in PCR tests. In a PCR test, a “master mix” containing microscopic primers and probes with short sequences of DNA are introduced to a sample in a test vial (for example, material collected using a nose swab). If the sample contains DNA matching the sequences in the primers, the primers will drive a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, in which they make billions of copies of the sequences, and the DNA probes will make those sequences glow when used in specialized lab machines which can then detect and quantify the antigen in its amplified form. On approximately February 10, 2020, IDT released a COVID-19 primer and probe kit using DNA sequence specifications previously published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) for use in primers and probes as a product for companies interested in commercializing PCR tests pursuant to a potential FDA EUA. In addition, on March 2, 2020, primer and probe kits manufactured by IDT became the first to be approved for use by CDC- approved laboratories to assemble their own diagnostic tests pursuant to a protocol for doing so developed by the CDC which previously received EUA by the FDA. By March 23, 2020, IDT shipped COVID-19 primer and probe kits with capacity to perform more than 10 million tests. As of May 2020, that number snowballed to 30 million tests. Later that month, IDT opened a manufacturing facility in North Carolina to keep up with demand for its COVID-19 products and reduce lead times for customers on the east coast of the United States. By the time the CDC discontinued its test kit design protocol on December 31, due to the increased availability of higher-throughput alternatives by private enterprises, IDT was one of just two companies with primer and probe kits qualified under the CDC’s EUA. Furthermore, the DNA sequences published by the CDC proved to be so effective that they became the gold standard for primers and probes and continued to be widely used in diagnostic tests. Cepheid was also uniquely positioned to capitalize on the EUA authorization for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. New forms of disease can be detected with its existing GeneXpert systems by simply outfitting the single-use cartridges used therein with probes that contain genetic sequences specific to that disease. In addition, its desktop machines were already in use at point- of-care centers throughout the world, including hospitals. On February 10, 2020, Cepheid announced that it was developing a new molecular test for the detection of COVID-19 designed for use on its existing GeneXpert systems. Cepheid expressly stated that it “intends to access the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization pathway for regulatory approval and make the test available globally.” On March 20, 2020, the FDA granted EUA for a new molecular test developed by Cepheid to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, designed for use on its existing GeneXpert systems branded as Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. This EUA was the first for a rapid, point-of-care molecular test in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a press release by the FDA with statements by the HHS Secretary and the Commissioner of the FDA.

      "summary": "The consolidated class action complaint alleges federal securities law violations against Focus Financial Partners Inc., its directors, officers, and special committee members (collectively, \"Defendants\") in connection with the company's $7 billion sale to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Plaintiffs, including institutional investors AltShares Event-Driven ETF, AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF, Kryger Event Fund Ltd., Kryger Enhanced Fund Ltd., and ODS Capital LLC, challenge the fairness of the sale process and the adequacy of disclosures to Focus shareholders. The complaint details how Focus and its largest shareholder, Stone Point Capital LLC (Stone Point), orchestrated a sale process that favored CD&R, a financial buyer, over potentially higher-value strategic buyers such as . Stone Point, owning 20.6% of Focus and controlling half the board, sought to liquidate part of its investment and benefit from lucrative Tax Receivable Agreements (TRAs) that would trigger a $90 million windfall upon a change of control. Stone Point also aimed to roll over its equity into the post-sale company, a benefit not typically offered by strategic buyers. The Focus board, influenced by these interests, limited outreach to financial buyers and excluded strategic acquirors, despite indications that strategic buyers could offer more value to shareholders. CD&R quickly emerged as the preferred buyer, explicitly stating its desire to retain Focus management post-sale and allow Stone Point to roll over its equity. The board provided CD&R with extensive due diligence and exclusive negotiations, while other interested parties, including , were held at arm's length and denied similar access. Despite submitting a superior $55 per share proposal, was stiff-armed by Defendants, who finalized the deal with CD&R at $53 per share. The special committee, purportedly independent and disinterested, was itself conflicted. Its members received unique payments ranging from $729,467 to $943,690 as a result of the merger, including TRA payments, accelerated unvested units, and increased fees for serving on the special committee. These conflicts were not disclosed in the proxy, which instead touted their purported independence. Defendants' conflicts of interest were compounded, moreover, by significant conflicts also harbored by the two financial advisors that assisted in connection with the process leading to the merger. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\"Goldman Sachs\"), which initiated the process and helped channel it towards financial buyers, was conflicted by extensive and longstanding business ties to Stone Point and CD&R. To make matters worse, Goldman Sachs was also running a contemporaneous competing sale process for a Focus subsidiary, NKSFB, LLC (\"NKSFB\"), and its management company KSFB Management, LLC (\"KSFB\"). As a result, Goldman Sachs limited the pool of potential Focus acquirors during the majority of Focus' sale process to bidders that were not involved in the NKSFB sale process. Goldman Sachs only contacted those bidders after the NKSFB sale collapsed and after a merger agreement with CD&R was already executed. This dynamic was not disclosed in the proxy. Jefferies LLC (\"Jefferies\"), which was brought in late to \"chaperone\" Goldman Sachs in recognition of its conflicts of interest, was incentivized to render a positive assessment of the deal by a massive, last-minute increase in its own fee. This too was not disclosed in the proxy. Ultimately, effectively every actor involved in the Focus sale process that was supposed to be working on behalf of Focus shareholders was badly conflicted. This led to an utterly deficient process in which Focus failed to adequately canvass the market and tilted the playing field in favor of CD&R, culminating in the stiff-arming of a potential buyer willing to pay shareholders significantly greater consideration than CD&R. Defendants acted to conceal all of these facts by issuing public disclosures that consistently omitted or shaded the truth. Instead, Defendants touted a counterfactual narrative in which the sale process was thorough and reliable, there were no significant conflicts of interest, and CD&R's underpriced $53 per share proposal offered shareholders \"the best value reasonably obtainable.\" Based on these materially false and misleading statements, Focus shareholders approved the merger and accepted the merger consideration.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"The complaint is a securities class action brought by investors, including lead plaintiff Kim Kengle and named plaintiff Roseanne Lacy, on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Walmart publicly traded common stock between March 31, 2017, and December 22, 2020 (the “Class Period”) and who held such shares on March 24, 2020, and/or December 22, 2020, and suffered compensable damages thereby (the “Class”). Investors bring this case because Walmart violated the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) for over a decade and concealed from investors the Government’s intensifying criminal and civil investigations into Walmart’s legal violations. As Walmart’s internal documents prior to the Class Period acknowledge, Walmart failed to comply with a secret 2011 settlement with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and did not have a system to monitor suspicious orders of opioids. As early as June 2014 Walmart acknowledged that it was “likely” that the Company would therefore face “severe financial and reputational harm.” As investors are now aware, in May 2018 the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas (“EDTX DOJ”) told Walmart that an indictment of the Company was imminent. While the EDTX DOJ began its criminal investigation (the “Criminal Investigation”) into Walmart in 2016, it was not until March 2020 that investors would learn that Walmart had been on the brink of indictment, and, that while Walmart had seemingly escaped criminal prosecution, it was still the subject of a DOJ civil investigation (“Civil Investigation,” together with the Criminal Investigation, “Government Investigations” or “Investigations”) related to Walmart’s dispensing and distributing opioids. Then, in December 2020 the DOJ filed an enforcement action against Walmart, laying bare the Company’s brazen misconduct and utter disregard of well- established legal requirements under the CSA. During the Class Period Defendants made false and misleading statements that concealed the Government Investigations and the risks related to the Company’s failure to comply with the CSA. Defendants violated SEC regulations and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that required the Company to disclose the Government Investigations and the risks related to the Company’s opioid dispensing and distribution business. Defendants affirmatively represented in Walmart’s Class Period SEC filings that it had disclosed all reasonably possible liabilities that may be material even though Walmart never specifically disclosed the Government Investigations. Further, in Walmart’s Class Period SEC filings Defendants set forth boilerplate risks related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired related to Walmart’s pharmacy business. Additionally, Walmart engaged in a PR campaign characterizing Walmart as a “steward” in combatting the opioid crisis. Walmart is the largest operator of discount retail stores in the United States. In addition to a diverse assortment of retail offerings Walmart stores have self-contained pharmacies. Accordingly, shoppers can fill prescriptions at nearly 5,000 Company-owned and operated retail pharmacies in the U.S. Indeed, Walmart operates pharmacies to draw customers into its stores who then buy other non- pharmacy goods. Since 2011, Walmart’s 5,000 pharmacies nationwide, which dispense prescription opioids and other controlled substances, have accounted for more than 10% of Walmart’s domestic net sales. In addition, until 2018, Walmart “self- distributed” controlled substances which serviced Walmart’s own retail pharmacies in the U.S. Because Walmart dispensed and distributed controlled substances, including highly addictive and dangerous Class II opioids, Walmart was subject to the comprehensive but well-established requirements of the CSA and related regulations. The CSA required Walmart to implement reporting mechanisms and controls designed to, inter alia, (i) identify and report to the DEA suspicious orders of controlled substances; (ii) identify and investigate suspicious prescriptions (e.g., large, repeat orders from “pill-mill” doctors) and “refuse to fill” (“RTF”) such orders; (iii) report RTF events to the DEA; (iv) provide internal reporting such that Walmart pharmacists could identify red-flagged prescriptions across its nationwide platform; and (v) prevent theft of controlled substances by Walmart employees. Walmart’s failure to comply with the CSA prompted the DEA to take nationwide action against it in 2009. In November 2009 the DEA issued an Order to Show Cause seeking to revoke the registration of a Walmart in California to dispense controlled substances. To resolve the enforcement proceeding stemming from the 2009 Order to Show Cause (“2009 OTSC”), and “avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation” Walmart and the DEA entered into a nationwide memorandum of agreement in 2011 (“2011 MOA”).1 The 2011 MOA was for a four-year term, was national in scope, and required Walmart to implement a variety of compliance measures within no later than four years and maintain a robust compliance program to ensure compliance with the CSA. The 2011 MOA essentially put Walmart on probation. Despite this, Walmart egregiously violated the 2011 MOA. As Brad Nelson, a controlled substances compliance director at Walmart wrote in an email to a regional manager less than a month before the MOA’s expiration: “The MOA requires that the reporting of Refusal to fills expires in 30 days. We have not invested a great amount of time and effort in doing analysis on the data since the agreement is virtually over. Driving sales and patient awareness is a far better use of our Market Directors and Market manager’s time.” The 2011 MOA is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Indeed, in 2014, Walmart’s corporate compliance department internally acknowledged, in a corporate governance “worksheet,” of which Walmart’s board of directors was informed, that Walmart had “no processes in place” to comply with its legal requirements to have a functioning suspicious order monitoring system pursuant to the 2011 MOA and the CSA. The Company further recognized that because of its CSA violations Walmart was “likely” to experience “severe financial and reputational impact.” Then, in 2015, Walmart internally acknowledged that its suspicious order monitoring system required “immediate and substantial enhancements” to “help Walmart avoid DEA enforcement as a result of non-compliance with [the CSA].” Unsurprisingly, EDTX DOJ began a criminal investigation into Walmart’s dispensing and distribution practices in December 2016. The Criminal Investigation came after the DEA raided one of Walmart’s stores- a rare occurrence for a Fortune 500 company. The Criminal Investigation uncovered Walmart’s systematic CSA violations. Walmart pharmacists from all over the country told the Company that they did not want to fill prescriptions of opioids because they were from doctors running pill mills. Customers in Texas had died after taking suspect prescriptions that Walmart filled. Pharmacists pleaded with Walmart’s corporate office. Walmart refused to take corporate-wide action. Instead, it provided bonuses to pharmacists based on the number of prescriptions filled and pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions as quickly as possible. On March 28, 2018, U.S. attorneys at EDTX DOJ informed Walmart that it was going to indict the Company. In May 2018, EDTX DOJ told Walmart that the indictment was imminent and that the Company should pay $1 billion to settle the civil charges. In the months that followed Walmart’s top lawyers met with EDTX prosecutors. Walmart’s lawyers consulted Defendant McMillon who approved the Company’s presentation to the DOJ wherein it attempted to convince the DOJ not to indict Walmart. Walmart’s top outside counsel at Jones Day highlighted the damage an indictment would cause to Walmart and its shareholders describing the “profound negative impact on the lives and families of the Company’s 1.5 million U.S. employees and its innocent shareholders. The decision to indict Walmart could ultimately result in layoffs. It would also likely mean the loss of billions of dollars in the value of Walmart shares held in retirement saving accounts for millions of Americans and the pension funds of countless nonprofits and public employees.” The U.S. Attorneys working on the Criminal Investigation characterized Walmart’s pleas as no different than that of a criminal defendant who pleads for leniency stating his children will be harmed by his incarceration. They stated that Walmart’s size did not make it above prosecution. According to federal prosecutors working on the case, Walmart exploited its access to high level DOJ officials by lobbying to quash the contemplated criminal indictment. Around the same time, Walmart hired Rachel Brand, A DOJ official in Washington DC- to further influence the DOJ. Shortly thereafter, DOJ leadership instructed the U.S. Attorney for EDTX to drop the criminal indictment. Notwithstanding the declination, of which Walmart was informed on August 31, 2018, the Civil Investigation against the Company continued. According to prosecutors, Walmart did not cooperate with the investigation. For example, Walmart never gave prosecutors a full list of doctors that pharmacists were concerned about; Walmart did not give prosecutors full information on its internal databases to analyze prescribing information and patterns; and most importantly, Walmart refused to produce emails between compliance officials and the Company’s senior management. Defendants concealed from Investors the existence of the Government Investigations, as well as the 2009 OTSC and 2011 MOA. On March 25, 2020 before the market opened, the Pulitzer-prize winning investigative journalism news source ProPublica published a 7,500 word expose disclosing for the first time that the EDTX DOJ had been criminally investigating Walmart for violating the CSA and related laws since 2016. The article revealed that in March 2018 Defendants became aware that EDTX DOJ intended to indict the Company and that even after the DOJ declined to indict the Company it remained the subject of an ongoing DOJ civil investigation. The article also revealed that Walmart entered a secret settlement with the DEA in 2011 in which it agreed to implement measures to comply with the CSA, and that Walmart had received more than 50 “Letters of Admonition” from the DEA from 2000 to 2018 for its opioid prescribing practices. The article further revealed that Walmart did not comply with the 2011 MOA, prompting the EDTX DOJ to pursue criminal charges against the Company. The article noted that it was “troubling to the federal investigators” that Walmart violated the CSA from 2011 to 2016, despite the fact that “for much of this period, Walmart was operating under a secret settlement…with the DEA” Indeed, “[p]rosecutors believed that Walmart was not fulfilling the terms of its agreement with the DEA.” On this news, shares of Walmart fell nearly 5%, or $5.63 per share from its closing price of $115.03 on March 24, 2020, to its close at $109.40 on March 25, 2020, damaging investors. Then, on December 22, 2020, the DOJ announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Walmart for alleged violations of the CSA. The DOJ’s complaint alleges that from June 26, 2013 onward, Walmart “knowingly filled thousands of controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical purposes or in the usual course of medical practice, and that it filled prescriptions outside the ordinary course of pharmacy practice.” The DOJ complaint also alleged that, “as the operator of its distribution centers, which ceased distributing controlled substances in 2018, Walmart received hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders that it failed to report as required to by the DEA.” The DOJ stated that “these actions helped to fuel the prescription opioid crisis.” The DOJ’s press release stated that it sought civil penalties which “could total in billions” and injunctive relief. On this news, Walmart’s stock price fell $2.75 per share, or 1.88%, over the next two trading days to close at $144.20 per share on December 23, 2020, damaging investors. Despite Defendants’ awareness of: (1) the 2011 MOA, (2) Walmart’s CSA violations, (3) the EDTX DOJ’s Criminal Investigation and intent to indict the Company, (4) the Civil Investigation and (5) Walmart’s own acknowledgment that it was likely the Company would face severe financial and reputational damage based on its CSA violations and failure to comply with the 2011 MOA, Defendants: 1) Misrepresented that they had disclosed all legal proceedings where a liability is “reasonably possible” and “may be material,” despite having never disclosed the Government Investigations (or the 2011 MOA); 2) violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles governing the disclosure of contingent liabilities by failing to disclose the Government Investigations as a contingent liability in Walmart’s Class Period financial statements despite being aware that it was at least reasonably possible (GAAP’s threshold requiring disclosure) that Walmart would incur a material liability as a result of the Government Investigations; 3) violated Item 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, 17. C.F.R. §229.30 (“Item 103”) which requires disclosure of material legal proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, by failing to disclose the Government Investigations; 4) set forth boilerplate risk disclosures related to Walmart’s pharmacy business and characterized, as hypothetical, risks that had already transpired while concealing the Government Investigations; and 5) falsely portrayed Walmart as a “steward” in the opioid crisis with “comprehensive policies and training to help support its pharmacists in filling prescriptions only for legitimate medical reasons” when in truth Walmart’s policies were specifically designed to prevent pharmacists from refusing to fill illegitimate prescriptions. Additionally, Defendants McMillon and Biggs issued false and misleading Sarbanes Oxley certifications attesting to the accuracy of the Company’s financial statements and statements in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports, despite the violations of GAAP and SEC regulations and false statements described above. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the decline in the market value of the Company’s securities following a series of corrective disclosures, Investors and other Class members suffered significant damages. JURISDICTION AND VENUE The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) and 78t(a)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the SEC (17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5). This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §78aa). Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) and Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. §78aa(c)) as the alleged misstatements entered and the subsequent damages took place in this judicial district. In connection with the acts, conduct and other wrongs alleged in this complaint, Defendants, directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including but not limited to, the United States mails, interstate telephone communications and the facilities of the national securities exchange.

McMillon and Biggs, as members of Walmart’s Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee, had specific insight into and awareness of compliance risks, including the risks related to Walmart’s business dispensing and distributing controlled substances. ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT Introduction As detailed below, prior to and during the Class Period Walmart acted as both a pharmacy that dispensed controlled substances and a distributor of controlled substances to its own Walmart and Sam’s Club branded pharmacies. At all relevant times, Walmart was subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (“Controlled Substances Act” or “CSA”). Prior to and during the Class Period Walmart flagrantly violated the CSA. On December 22, 2020, after conducting a “painstaking” investigation, the United States Department of Justice filed a civil enforcement action against Walmart in this Court. A copy of the complaint in the DOJ Action (“DOJ Complaint”) is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein. The DOJ Complaint alleges that “Walmart chose, for years, to disregard a well-established legal obligation on a systematic basis and a huge scale involving at least hundreds of thousands"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This action arises from Defendants’ numerous fraudulent actions and misrepresentations regarding the Companies’ foreign exchange (forex) trading platform and services, for which the Companies and Individual Defendants have converted tens of millions of dollars belonging to Plaintiffs for Defendants’ benefit. Defendants represented to Plaintiffs that Defendant Merino had invented an algorithm that would allow clients such as Plaintiffs to receive high returns on forex trading, which would be collectively run by CFT and its broker, FxWinning. Defendants pitched the Companies as providing not just high returns, however, but they also guaranteed the security of Plaintiffs’ funds – investments which would, in the end, total tens of millions of dollars. But Defendants’ representations turned out to be false. While Defendants initially permitted several withdrawals by Plaintiffs from their accounts through December – to lull Plaintiffs into a false sense of security and convince Plaintiffs to deposit Plaintiffs Hind, Waiton, Stoeppelwerth, Jenkins, Malcolm, Salmeron, Floyd, Vogel, Bentley, Donahue, Powers, Waiton, Morgan, Tarsis, Sellers, and Harrold have agreed to arbitrate their claims against Defendants CFT, de Rocha, and Percy in Counts I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI pursuant to the limited powers of attorney agreements they signed. They remain plaintiffs here against Defendants FxWinning, Brito, Cardenas, and Merino. Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 3 of 44 additional funds – Defendants discontinued all withdrawals in early 2023 under the guise of instituting new security-guided procedures to comply with requirements of its liquidity provider, i.e., new Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Defendants’ purported justifications were farcical – and indeed fraudulent – because, even after purportedly establishing the KYC and AML procedures and expressly informing Plaintiffs in May and June 2023 that their KYC and AML updates were “successfully completed” and that Plaintiffs would have their funds within fifteen working days, Defendants have still failed to release a single dollar. To this day, Defendants have wrongfully held – and continue to withhold – more than $27,000,000.00 belonging to Plaintiffs. For these and the following reasons, Plaintiffs bring this action to recover their wrongfully withheld funds and seek damages against Defendants as a result of Defendants’ fraudulent and improper actions. THE PARTIES Plaintiff Kristoffer Jon Hind is an individual over the age of eighteen who resides in San Diego County, California. Plaintiff Jason Thomas Waiton is an individual over the age of eighteen who resides in San Diego County, California.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the case arises, in part, under Sections 5 and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e and 771(a)(1), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. This Court alternatively has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it arises, in part, under Sections 6 and 25 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b, 6e, 6o, and 25. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 because such claims are so closely related to the Securities claims and/or Commodity Exchange Act claims that they are part of the same case and controversy. Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 7 of 44 Personal jurisdiction exists over Defendants because this dispute arises out of, or is related to, the Defendants’ contacts with this forum, including but not limited to operating the Companies from Miami-Dade County, Florida (as both CFT Solutions and FxWinning have their principal or other places of business in the state) and directing their operations to citizens in Florida (among numerous U.S. citizens in several states). Indeed, FxWinning’s partner CFT stated in its own lawsuit against FxWinning that FxWinning “operates, conducted, engaged in, or carried on a business venture in Florida and breached the contract at issue in this action in Florida by failing to perform acts required by the contract to be performed in Florida.”2 Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the acts that form the basis of this action occurred in this district, the Companies operate out of Miami- Dade County, Florida, and the Companies sold the investment accounts in their platform out of Florida. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS Upon information and belief, CFT was established in 2019 by de Rocha. Upon further information and belief, de Rocha hired Percy to be CFT’s COO. CFT purports to offer investors a “High-Frequency Trading System” that “use[s] . . . high-power computers . . . to execute a large number of orders at extremely high speeds, detecting emerging trends in a fraction of a second,” that accordingly allows “traders [to] make profits even with very small price fluctuations.”3 CFT’s lawsuit is captioned CFT Solutions, LLC et al. v. FxWinning LTD, and was filed on May 5, 2023 as local case no. 2023-016392-CA-01 in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida. In separate filings in that lawsuit, CFT has similarly described FxWinning as operating a “fraudulent enterprise.” See Docket No. 48 for CFT’s Ex Parte Motion for Alternative Service on Roman Cardenas.

Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 8 of 44 CFT’s software allegedly conducts trades on the foreign exchange (forex) market. According to CFT, investors gain access to its software only by opening an account with FxWinning (and in pari passu, that through the FxWinning brokerage account, the investor can access CFT’s “High-Frequency Trading System”). Upon information and belief, FxWinning was established in early 2020 by Brito Cutie and Merino. Upon information and belief, Brito Cutie and Merino hired Cardenas to be FxWinning’s vice president of operations in the United States. FxWinning operates at least two websites, fxwinning.net and fxwinning.pro, which are online platforms where customers can access their CFT/FxWinning accounts. According to its website, FxWinning is a “brokerage firm” offering a “powerful [ ] trading platform” “exclusive . . . to retail and institutional clients around the world” that “guarantee[s] you the best spreads and trading conditions.”4 FxWinning’s description of its platform and services mirrors CFT’s description of its own software. Upon information and belief, the Companies’ platforms are one-and-the-same, if any such platform or software ever existed. FxWinning represents that it “has purchased Client Money Insurance (CMI) on behalf of our clients and is a member of a network of responsible global financial service providers offering additional layers of security.”5 Moreover, FxWinning represents that its platform is “transparen[t]” and that FxWinning segregates all client funds from its separate company accounts.6 FxWinning Net, Home Page, https://fxwinning.net/index_en.html; and FxWinning Net, News Page, https://www.fxwinning.pro/news?lang=en.

Collectively, CFT, FxWinning, de Rocha, and Brito Cutie touted the Companies’ services and platform to Plaintiffs to induce Plaintiffs to invest millions of dollars with the Companies. To that end, CFT created a Telegram channel on July 19, 2021 to “send information about our HFT [High-Frequency Trading] system and some pertinent information about the Forex world and the world economy.” The Telegram channel was directed specifically to U.S. based investors, among others. Included here is a true and correct copy of a screenshot of CFT’s Telegram channel dated July 19, 2021: Past screenshots of FxWinning.net’s website are available through the Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20220704063456/https://fxwinning.net/index_en.html. Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 10 of 44 CFT immediately began promoting the success rate of its platform and thanked its customers for their “trust” in CFT.

CFT stated that FxWinning “will also be present so that clients can meet executives from fxwinning which is the broker we use and offers all the support so that we can run our software at high performance.” Included here is a true and correct copy of a screenshot of CFT’s Telegram channel dated December 10, 2021 (with highlights added): Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 13 of 44 FxWinning’s executives met U.S. based clients at the Miami, Florida “Masterminds” event and upon information and belief knew and were informed, to the extent FxWinning did not previously know, that its clients were based in the U.S. (in Florida, among other states). CFT continuously touted its link with its broker—FxWinning—which it claimed was “regulated under one of the most difficult to obtain Forex regulations in the world” (without specifying which regulations FxWinning was regulated under). Included here is a true and correct copy of a screenshot of CFT’s Telegram channel dated March 28, 2022 (with highlights added): Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 14 of 44 CFT stated in March 2022 that funds were transferred directly to the Companies’ liquidity provider. On April 10, 2022, CFT stated that it was “+44% positive this year 2022,” compared to all other markets, which CFT contended “are all in the negative.” CFT told Plaintiffs through its Telegram channel that “2022 is going to be an amazing year.” And on May 24, 2022, CFT represented to Plaintiffs that the Companies were “ending the month with an AMAZING result” and that even in a recession “Our software will always perform better in situations of chaos and extreme volatility.” In so doing, CFT acknowledged that it was its purported “software” that provided profits to investors, not any independent action by the investors. Defendants also represented higher returns were available to investors that invested (either individually or as a pool) $4 million or more. In addition to its Telegram channel, de Rocha hosted monthly Zoom sessions exclaiming the benefits to investing with CFT and FxWinning, stating (through his translator Renaud Adorno) that de Rocha had “zero” issues with FxWinning and trusted it over any other Case 1:23-cv-23139-RNS Document 42 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/01/2023 Page 15 of 44 potential broker. Plaintiffs viewed de Rocha’s Zoom sessions both before and after investing with CFT and FxWinning.

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Lead Plaintiffs Sudhakara R. Murikinati, Jerry Nixon, Benjamin Sandmann, and Jeff S. Turnipseed (collectively, “Lead Plaintiffs”), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, by Lead Plaintiffs’ undersigned attorneys, for Lead Plaintiffs’ complaint against Defendants (defined below), allege the following based upon personal knowledge as to Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs’ own acts and upon information and belief as to all other matters based on the investigation conducted by and through Lead Plaintiffs’ attorneys, which included, among other things, a review of United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings by GoHealth, Inc. (“GoHealth” or “Company”), as well as media and analyst reports about the Company and Company press releases and conference call transcripts. Lead Plaintiffs believe that substantial additional evidentiary support will exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery. NATURE OF THE ACTION The claims asserted herein are strict liability claims for violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§77k and 77o, relating to GoHealth’s initial public offering (“IPO” or “Offering”), commenced on or about July 14, 2020, of over 44,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $21.00 per share, which generated over $900 million in gross proceeds. This federal securities class action is brought on behalf of a Class (as defined herein) of all those who purchased GoHealth Class A common stock in or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with the IPO. GoHealth was formed on March 27, 2020, and was the issuer of stock in the IPO pursuant to the Registration Statement. Despite its legal formation shortly before the IPO, GoHealth has been in business since 2001. GoHealth is organized as a holding company, with GoHealth Holdings, LLC as its principal asset. Through a complex structure, GoHealth’s Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 3 of 62 PageID #:710 operations are carried out by Norvax, LLC (“Norvax”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blizzard Midco, LLC, which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GoHealth Holdings. GoHealth Holdings was previously known as Blizzard Parent, LLC. That changed in September 2019, when private equity firm Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (“Centerbridge Partners”) acquired 100% of Norvax and effectively took control of the Company along with its founders. Even after the IPO, GoHealth remained a controlled company, with Centerbridge Partners and the Company’s founders owning the majority of GoHealth stock and exercising control over its Board of Directors (“Board”). As for its business operations, GoHealth operates a health insurance marketplace that uses a combination of online websites and licensed agents to help consumers sign up for health insurance with health insurance carriers. The Company operates in four business segments: (a) Medicare-Internal; (b) Medicare-External; (c) Individual and Family Plans (“IFP”) and Other- Internal; and (d) IFP and Other-External. In the four years leading up to the IPO, GoHealth shifted its focus to signing up consumers for Medicare products, specifically Medicare Advantage plans,1 as opposed to individual or family insurance plans. This enabled GoHealth to rapidly grow in the intensely competitive insurance sales market in the time period before the IPO. In the Registration Statement, GoHealth emphasized that its shift to Medicare enabled the Company to capitalize on “strong demographic trends,” as Medicare enrollment was expected to grow from approximately million individuals in 2019 to approximately 77 million individuals by 2028, with 10,000 plus Medicare Advantage or “MA” is a type of health insurance plan that provides Medicare benefits through a private-sector health insurer. In a Medicare Advantage plan, a Medicare beneficiary pays a monthly premium to a private insurance company and receives coverage for inpatient hospital and outpatient services. Typically, the plan also includes prescription drug coverage. Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 4 of 62 PageID #:711 Americans turning 65 every day, and with an increasing proportion of Medicare-eligible individuals choosing commercial insurance solutions by enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans instead of basic Medicare. The Registration Statement stated that GoHealth estimated a “total addressable market” of $28 billion for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. The Registration Statement added that the Medicare market trends were poised to “drive a larger market in the coming years” that, when taken together with GoHealth’s “other product and plan offerings,” would result in an even larger addressable market. In the Registration Statement, GoHealth described itself as primed to disrupt the traditional field agent-driven sales process for insurance, and specifically for Medicare, by using its digitally-enabled and technology-driven marketplace. Consumers using GoHealth to shop for insurance do not pay any fees for access to the Company’s platform or for enrollment or other services. Rather, GoHealth is typically paid an initial commission by health insurance carriers when consumers enroll in carriers’ products and become customers, and additional recurring commissions as long as those customers retain their health insurance plans. Therefore, customer “persistency” – i.e., customers staying enrolled in their health insurance plans – was necessary to counter “churn,” an industry term used to describe customers who drop from one insurance company’s plan in favor of a competitor’s plan. The Registration Statement touted GoHealth’s “strong” relationships with leading insurance carriers and its 19-year track record of “industry-leading” growth, pointing to a 52% compound annual growth rate between 2003 and 2019. The financial information included in the Registration Statement demonstrated GoHealth’s rapid growth leading up to the IPO. For example, the Registration Statement stated that GoHealth’s: Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 5 of 62 PageID #:712 (a) total commissions receivable, which represented expected future commission streams, was $388.8 million as of the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (“1Q2020”), an increase of 223.4% compared to the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 (“1Q2019”); (b) net revenues grew by 104.1% to $141.0 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to $69.1 million for 1Q2019, and by 138.5% to $539.5 million for pro forma 2019 compared to $226.2 million for 2018; (c) adjusted EBITDA grew by 394% to $35.2 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to $7.1 million for 1Q2019, and by 387.6% to $170 million for pro forma 2019 from $34.9 million for 2018; and (d) net income was $1.4 million for pro forma 1Q2020 compared to net income of $5 million for 1Q2019, and net income was $30.5 million for pro forma 2019 compared to net income of $28.1 million for 2018. The Registration Statement also stated that GoHealth’s recent focus on Medicare had contributed significantly to its growth, with total revenues generated in GoHealth’s Medicare segments growing to $124.2 million for 1Q2020 from $41.2 million for 1Q2019, representing a 201.5% increase, and to $432.7 million for pro forma 2019 from $112.2 million for 2018, representing a 285.7% increase. In the Medicare segments, GoHealth’s total submitted policies grew to over 132,000 Medicare policies for 1Q2020, as compared to 43,200 Medicare policies for 1Q2019, and over 427,000 Medicare policies for 2019 as compared to over 118,000 Medicare policies for 2018. The majority of the Company’s revenues and profits are generated in its Medicare segments, making those segments critically important to the Company’s financial performance. In Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 6 of 62 PageID #:713 1Q2020, the Medicare segments generated 89% of the Company’s revenues, with the Medicare- Internal segment accounting for 68% of GoHealth’s total revenues and the Medicare-External segment accounting for 21% of total revenues. Within the Medicare segments, Medicare Advantage products generate the majority of net revenues, accounting for 75% of net revenues for the Medicare-Internal segment and 95% of net revenues for the Medicare-External segment during 1Q2020. Although the Company’s important Medicare-Internal segment, which focused on Medicare Advantage plans, generated the lion’s share of GoHealth’s revenues and drove GoHealth’s overall financial performance, it was concentrated heavily on just two insurance carrier customers: Humana Inc. (“Humana”) and Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”). In 2019, Humana and Anthem accounted for 40% and 20%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues. In 1Q2020, Humana and Anthem collectively accounted for 74% of the Company’s total revenues, up from 43% in 1Q2019. The Registration Statement stated that GoHealth’s key financial metric, a ratio that GoHealth calls “LTV/CAC,” was first among its peers. LTV/CAC is a shorthand description that divides the lifetime value of commissions that GoHealth estimated it would receive per “approved submission” (“LTV”) by the cost to convert a prospective customer into an actual one that signs up for an insurance policy with a carrier (“CAC”). As a result, LTV/CAC is a measure of the Company’s commissions relative to its customer acquisition cost. Despite being a critical metric to the Company’s financial performance, the complexity of GoHealth’s LTV/CAC made it impossible for investors to understand exactly how it was calculated for one period versus another or to calculate it for themselves. For example, the Company defined LTV/CAC in the Registration Statement as follows: Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 7 of 62 PageID #:714 “LTV/CAC” refers to the Lifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost, which we define as (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions2 for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a prospect into a customer less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less other revenue and is presented on a per commissionable Approved Submission basis. Many of the metrics that went into GoHealth’s LTV/CAC were not reported individually, turning GoHealth’s critical financial metric into a veritable black box. Despite this, it is clear that GoHealth uses real-time data to continuously analyze and understand the day-to-day financial performance of its operations, including how those fluctuations impact GoHealth’s LTV/CAC. For example, the Company repeatedly emphasized as a main selling point to investors that GoHealth, in real time, collects data on all aspects of its business and various financial performance metrics. The Company uses advanced statistical models to calculate and predict LTV/CAC and the profitability and conversion probability of consumer leads, as well as future commission streams associated with each consumer enrolled in each specific plan product, all of which the Company uses to determine its total commissions receivable. With GoHealth’s eye-popping growth, swelling revenues, and industry-leading LTV/CAC, there was significant demand in anticipation of the IPO. On June 19, 2020, GoHealth filed a draft Registration Statement with the SEC on Form S-1. The Registration Statement was amended by a filing on July 8, 2020, which stated the IPO would consist of 39.5 million shares at an offering price of $19.00 per share. Then, on July 14, 2020, GoHealth increased the size of the Offering by 4.6 million shares, bringing the total Offering to 44.5 million shares. Two weeks after “Approved Submissions” refer to Submitted Policies approved by carriers for the identified product during the indicated period. Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 8 of 62 PageID #:715 the close of the second quarter of 2020 (“2Q2020”), on July 14, 2020, GoHealth priced the IPO at $21.00 per share and filed the final Prospectus for the IPO, which forms part of the Registration Statement. By July 17, 2020, GoHealth completed the IPO, selling 44.5 million shares at $21.00 per share, generating over $913,500,000 in gross proceeds. The Registration Statement, in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act, contained materially false statements, omitted statements necessary to make the statements made in the Registration Statement not misleading, and failed to disclose information that was required to be disclosed therein. Specifically, unbeknownst to investors, because it was not disclosed in the Registration Statement, GoHealth was suffering heightened customer churn at the time of the IPO. In addition, GoHealth had reached the limits of the growth that could be achieved under its existing business model, and as a result, was required to radically depart from its business strategy leading up to the IPO in order to continue generating rapid revenue growth. To make this necessary change, the Company and its senior executives and officers planned to make 2020 an “investment year” for the Company, in which GoHealth would significantly and rapidly expand its insurance carrier customer base for Medicare. These plans created negative pressure on the Company’s critical LTV/CAC metric by, among other things: (a) lowering commission rates on approved submissions; (b) significantly increasing marketing expenses; (c) impairing persistency and generating a corresponding increase in customer churn, or, at a minimum, requiring GoHealth to increase its efforts (and costs) to combat churn; and (d) reducing GoHealth’s commissionable revenue in favor of increased non-commissionable revenue, which also dragged down GoHealth’s LTV and resulted in decreased persistency. Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 9 of 62 PageID #:716 GoHealth’s planned, but not disclosed, altering of its business strategy was necessary because, prior to and at the time of the IPO, the Company had relied heavily on just two Medicare carrier customers: Humana and Anthem. The Company had effectively maximized the growth that could be achieved by continuing to rely on these two carriers. Thus, in order to continue increasing its financial performance at the rate investors expected at the time of the IPO, GoHealth needed to route increasing numbers of Medicare-eligible consumers to a greater variety of insurance carriers while simultaneously expanding into new geographies. As a result, GoHealth needed to rapidly expand its base of insurance carrier customers. Rather than reading about GoHealth’s planned “investment year” in the Registration Statement as was required, investors learned of it in a series of post-IPO events. On August 19, 2020, GoHealth reported its financial results for 2Q2020 ended June 30, 2020, which closed two weeks before the IPO. During an after-hours conference call to discuss GoHealth’s 2Q2020 financial results and outlook, investors learned that GoHealth had added and was adding many new carriers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Kaiser, and “some other regional” Blue Cross Blue Shield providers as the Company “look[ed] towards 2021.” Investors also learned that when the Company added new Medicare insurance carrier customers, there was “an initial ramp- up period for new carriers with forecasted lower LTVs” and that the Company’s “strategy to add several new large carriers” was resulting and would continue to result in “lower initial commission rates and LTVs.” The “strategic decision” by the Company also included an increased focus on GoHealth promoting and selling Medicare “Special Needs Plans” (“SNPs”),3 which resulted in Medicare SNPs are a type of Medicare Advantage plan designed to attract and enroll Medicare beneficiaries who fall into certain special needs demographics. Special needs individuals typically include: (a) institutionalized individuals (living in a long-term care facility or needing an equivalent level of care at home); (b) dually eligible individuals (meaning also entitled to Medicare and some form of Medicaid benefit); or (c) individuals with severe or chronic disabling conditions. Case: 1:20-cv-05593 Document #: 66 Filed: 02/25/21 Page 10 of 62 PageID #:717 non-commissionable “other” revenue, that also created a “near-term drag on [GoHealth’s] average LTV” and resulted in higher disenrollment rates, e.g., churn. When GoHealth reported its third quarter financial results for the period ending September 30, 2020 (“3Q2020”), it not only reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was $0.64 worse than analyst estimates of a loss per share of $0.01, but it again increased its reliance on non- commissionable revenue to the detriment of commissionable revenue, creating more “near-term” drag on the Company’s average LTV. The extent to which 2020 was an “investment year” was made clear well after the IPO. On December 2, 2020, investors learned that GoHealth’s plan for 2020 included reduced, lower-than-normal commissions from newly added carriers and LTV compression, with the Company not seeing the “upside” until 2021. Specifically, during the Evercore ISI HealthCONx Conference on December 2, 2020, GoHealth’s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Co-Chair of the Company’s Board, Clinton P. Jones (“Jones”), stated: So we anticipated 2020 to be an investment year with new carriers. If you think about a new carrier, there’s technology integrations, there’s understanding other compliance and nuances, there’s understanding all the different plan options and plan types and building that out. [Indiscernible] side of things. So there’s a -- and we also -- when you add a new carrier, you’re typically not -- they don’t view you as anybody special, right? They’re going to give you just a normal commission level. You’ve got to prove yourself on volume and quality to move up the ranks. And typically, you’ll see LTV compression there because you don’t have the top commission rates, which we anticipated, we’ve modeled out, and we thought that would happen. As we think about where we’ve gone from a volume standpoint, we quickly rose through the ranks, we’ve proven ourselves, and we think there’s more upside in 2021 from an LTV standpoint with carriers. We also know more about their effectuation rates,"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Parties: Plaintiff DarkPulse, Inc. (DarkPulse), a Delaware corporation, and Defendants FirstFire Global Opportunity Fund, LLC (FirstFire), a Delaware LLC, and Eli Fireman (Fireman), managing member of FirstFire Capital Management, LLC.\\n\\nAlleged Misconduct: FirstFire is accused of being a “death spiral” or “toxic” lender, operating as an unregistered securities dealer that makes unlawful, predatory loans to small, publicly traded companies. Toxic lenders like FirstFire See SEC discussion (and warnings) about toxic lending and convertible securities, https://www.investor.gov /introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/convertible-securities (last accessed on December 22, 2021.) Based on a review of the filings in the EDGAR database from March 17, 2015 to date, FirstFire has engaged in financing similar to this case on at least 203 separate occasions with at least 89 other microcap companies, resulting in approximately 203 securities transactions with at least 1,001,396,742 shares being issued, with an estimated open purport to be investors who ‘save’ struggling microcap companies, but the reality is very much the opposite: FirstFire is not an investor, but rather a creditor that, in keeping with typical toxic lending arrangements, gives itself the right to take payment of the debt in company stock, but with a substantial discount to the market price. Unlike a typical private-placement investor, FirstFire can immediately dump the stock into the public market to reap the difference between the discount and the market price.3 Moreover, because it can convert the debt in tranches, FirstFire is able to dump large quantities of the newly-issued stock into the market and remain unaffected by the price depression that its selling tends to cause. The Agreements4 in this case are a masterful example of toxic lending. In two separate convertible promissory notes, FirstFire loaned to DarkPulse a combined total of $975,000. As repayment of those two Notes, FirstFire extracted more than $38 million dollars in company stock from DarkPulse, which it immediately sold into the public market. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), FirstFire’s business model is not simply predatory, it is patently unlawful. In several recent civil actions, the market value of tens of millions of dollars. See Exhibit 3 (EDGAR Spreadsheet, listing securities transactions by FirstFire identified in issuer EDGAR filings). Toxic lenders take advantage of the so-called “tacking” provisions currently provided in Rule 144, see 17 CFR 230.144(d)(3)(ii). Recognizing the harms to microcaps and their investors caused by toxic lending, the SEC has proposed rulemaking to revise the holding period for securities acquired upon the conversion or exchange of certain market-adjustable securities like those used by FirstFire: “Currently, Rule 144 deems securities acquired solely in exchange for other securities of the same issuer to have been acquired at the same time as the securities surrendered for conversion or exchange. Under the amendments, the holding period for the underlying securities acquired upon conversion or exchange of ‘market-adjustable securities’ would not begin until conversion or exchange, meaning that a purchaser would need to hold the underlying securities for the applicable Rule 144 holding period before reselling them under Rule 144.” See Notice of Proposed Rule, https://www.sec. gov/rules/proposed/2020/33-10911.pdf (last accessed on May 4, 2021) (“Prop. Rule”). The “Agreements” refer to the agreements executed by Plaintiff in favor of FirstFire, viz.: (1) a Convertible Promissory Note for $247,500.00 executed on April 20, 2018, (constituted by a “Senior Convertible Promissory Note” and Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”)) (“September 2018 Note”); and (2) a Convertible Promissory Note executed for $825,000.00 executed on April 26, 2021 (also constituted by a “Convertible Promissory Note” and SPA) (“April Note” and together with the September 2018 Note, the “Notes”). A true and correct copy of each of the Notes and SPAs are attached as follows: (1) September 2018 Note and SPA as Exhibit 1; and (2) April 2021 Note and SPA as Exhibit 2. The securities transactions effected by the Agreements are hereinafter referred to as the “DarkPulse Transactions.” SEC has prosecuted toxic lenders for unlawfully operating as unregistered securities dealers, in violation of § 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) (15 U.S.C. § 78o). Every court to address the matter has agreed with the SEC.5 The toxic lenders under scrutiny in the SEC cases use FirstFire’s precise business model (indeed, the contracts seem to have been drafted by the same firm), and—like FirstFire— refrain from registering with the SEC in order to evade regulatory oversight and continue making predatory loans that generate outrageous profits. The remedy sought by the SEC in those cases (and awarded in cases that have progressed to judgment) is disgorgement of profits and cancellation of any remaining shares. See SEC v. Almagarby, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186477 (S.D. Fla. Sep. 29, 2021) (Order). Similarly, in addition to other remedies, the remedy sought by Plaintiff here is rescission of the DarkPulse Transactions pursuant to § 29(b) of the Act, on the ground that each of the contracts was both made and performed in violation of § 15(a) of the Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 78o. Further, the Agreements in this case charge DarkPulse a rate of interest that is criminally usurious under New York law. As shown in greater detail below, the Agreements charge an annualized interest rate of more than double the maximum rate of interest that may be charged by New York which is 25% APR. See N.Y. G.O.L. § 5-501; N.Y. Penal Law § 190.40.6 Consistent with FirstFire’s established business model, the Agreements provided FirstFire with a conversion option, that is, the right to take repayment by exchanging the accrued See, e.g., SEC v. Big Apple Consulting USA, Inc.,783 F.3d 786 (11th Cir. 2015); SEC v. Almagarby, 479 F. Supp. 3d 1266 (S.D. Fla. 2020); SEC v. Keener, 2020 WL 4736205 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 14, 2020); SEC v. Fierro, 2020 WL (D.N.J. Dec. 18, 2020); SEC v. River N. Equity LLC, 415 F. Supp. 3d 853 (N.D. Ill. 2019); SEC v. Fife, 2021 WL 5998525 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 20, 2021). For private civil actions seeking rescission based on failure to register, see Edgepoint Capital Holdings, LLC v. Apothecare Pharmacy, LLC, 6 F.4th 50 (1st Cir. 2021); Auctus Fund, LLC, v. Players Network, Inc., 20-cv-10766 (D. Mass. Dec. 10, 2021). See Adar Bays, LLC v. GeneSYS, ID, Inc., 37 N.Y.3d 320 (N.Y. 2021). debt (or any portion thereof) for shares of company stock. Consistent with its conversion option, that is, the right to take repayment by exchanging the accrued debt (or any portion thereof) for shares of company stock. Consistent with its general practices, FirstFire does not exchange debt on a dollor-for-dollar basis, but at a significant discount to market at the time of conversion. FirstFire is an “enterprise” as defined in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”). See U.S.C. 18 § 1961, et seq. FirstFire has engaged in the collection of unlawful debt at the direction and control of Defendant Eli Fireman, culpable “person” as defined in RICO. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961. FirstFire collected an unlawful debt from DarkPulse when it obtained stock pursuant to the conversion feature of the usurious Agreements. Accordingly, among other relief, DarkPulse seeks an award of treble damages under RICO, because the amount of interest charged by FirstFire in the Agreements is more than double the maximum enforceable rate allowed by New York law, and FirstFire conducts a business of making usurious loans. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78aa and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because Plaintiff is asserting a claim under the Act. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) because Defendants’ principal place of business is located in this District and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred in this District. Notwithstanding that the DarkPulse Transactions should be voided and rescinded in their entirety by the Court for the reasons stated herein, Defendants should be estopped from denying that jurisdiction or venue is proper in this Court because the Agreements provide expressly that any action brought by either party concerning the transactions contemplated by the Agreements must be brought in state or federal courts located in the State of New York.7 III. PARTIES DarkPulse’s principal place of business is located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10105. DarkPulse is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware.8 DarkPulse’s stock trades on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market, where the stocks of early-stage, developing companies—too small for the major stock exchanges—are traded. FirstFire’s principal place of business is located at 1040 First Avenue, Suite 190, New York, New York 10022. FirstFire is registered as a Delaware limited liability company. FirstFire’s website9 showed that FirstFire held itself out to the public as a “New York based investment manager” that “will source, structure, and execute direct investments in publicly traded companies with market capitalizations under $750 million.” See Notes at § 4.6; SPAs at § 8a. In April 2018, DarkPulse was located in Virginia.

FirstFire Capital Management, LLC, is not now, and has never been, registered as a securities dealer with the SEC. IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS FirstFire executed the first securities transaction with DarkPulse on September 20, when it purchased from DarkPulse a convertible promissory note, a type of debt security constituted by a promissory note and a share purchase agreement. FirstFire paid DarkPulse $225,000 for the September 2018 Note, for which DarkPulse was obligated to repay FirstFire $247,500 plus 8% interest, due in nine months. The September 2018 Note also gave FirstFire the right, commencing 180 days after purchase, to exchange all or any portion of the debt for company stock, at a 30% discount to the market price.10 By exercising the conversion option, Defendants exchanged the debt under the note (securities) for newly-issued company stock (securities). On June 7, 2019, FirstFire began conversion of the September 2018 Note. In all, FirstFire effectuated 18 separate conversions under the September 2018 Note. Each of those 18 conversions, as well as the subsequent sales of the stock obtained thereby, are transactions in securities; with each conversion or sale, FirstFire used the mail and or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect a transaction in securities. FirstFire’s conversions of debt into DarkPulse stock under the September 2018 Note are as follows: a. 6/7/2019: converted $5,340.00 of debt for 7,000,000 shares of common stock; b. 6/18/2019: converted $3,331.00 of debt for 7,000,000 shares of common stock; c. 6/24/2019: converted $2,778.00 of debt for 7,900,000 shares of common stock; d. 7/8/2019: converted $1,560.00 of debt for 6,000,000 shares of common stock; e. 7/15/2019: converted $1,560.00 of debt for 6,000,000 shares of common stock; With the value of the 30% conversion discount added to 10% original issue discount and the stated 8% interest rate, it is clear that the September 2018 Note violates the 25% interest rate cap set forth in New York’s criminal usury laws. See Adar Bays v. GeneSYS ID, Inc., 2021 NY Slip Op. 05616, 2021 WL 4777289 (Oct. 14, 2021). f. 7/24/2019: converted $2,708.00 of debt for 11,600,000 shares of common stock; g. 7/30/2019: converted $3,296.00 of debt for 13,700,000 shares of common stock; h. 8/5/2019: converted $3,008.00 of debt for 16,100,000 shares of common stock; i. 8/9/2019: converted $1,492.00 of debt for 17,800,000 shares of common stock; j. 8/15/2019: converted $1,426.00 of debt for 20,900,000 shares of common stock; k. 9/6/2019: converted $4,900.00 of debt for 35,000,000 shares of common stock; l. 9/10/2019: converted $4,900.00 of debt for 35,000,000 shares of common stock; m. 9/20/2019: converted $2,765.00 of debt for 35,900,000 shares of common stock; n. 9/1/2020: converted $7,000 of debt for 85,000,000 shares of common stock; o. 1/14/2021: converted $28,000 of debt for 100,000,000 shares of common stock; p. 1/25/2021: converted $42,000 of debt for 150,000,000 shares of common stock; q. 2/5/2021: converted $28,000.00 of debt for 100,000,000 shares of common stock; and r. 2/18/2021: converted $103,436 of debt for 220,000,000 shares of common stock. In all, FirstFire exchanged $247,500 worth of debt for 879,400,000 shares of newly- issued stock. The estimated open market value of the stock FirstFire acquired from converting the debt under the September 2018 Note totaled $10,738,900.00. Upon information and belief, as soon as FirstFire received the newly-issued DarkPulse shares, it immediately sold them into the marketplace to reap a substantial profit. As shown in the following list, the average daily trading volume in DarkPulse stock increased dramatically in the days following each FirstFire conversion, demonstrating FirstFire’s well-known practice of dumping issuer stock into the market as soon as possible.11 ● 30 days prior to first conversion: 4,646,131 ● 10 days following 06/07/2019 conversion: 8,235,159 ● 10 days following 06/24/2019 conversion: 12,059,811 ● 10 days following 07/08/2019 conversion: 11,579,818 ● 10 days following 07/15/2019 conversion: 13,563,234 On April 26, 2021, the parties executed a second securities transaction in which FirstFire purchased from DarkPulse a second convertible promissory note. In that transaction, FirstFire paid DarkPulse $750,000 for the April 2021 Note, which obligated DarkPulse to repay in the amount of $825,000.00, plus 10% APR in interest, with a nine-month maturity date. The April 2021 Note is a security under the Act, constituted by a promissory note and a share purchase agreement, which gave FirstFire the right to convert the debt into stock. Unlike the fixed discount under the September 2018 Note the April 2021 Note provided a fixed price of $0.015 per share; however, that price would reduce to $0.005 per share upon the occurrence of any incident of default which is, . The April 2021 Note specified that it was governed by New York law. See EXH.2, Note at 4.6; SPA at ¶ 8. See Prop. Rule, supra at note 3 (“If the securities are converted or exchanged after the Rule 144 holding period is satisfied, the underlying securities may be sold quickly into the public market at prices above the price at which they were acquired. Accordingly, initial purchasers or subsequent holders have an incentive to purchase the market- adjustable securities with a view to distribution of the underlying securities following conversion to capture the difference between the built-in discount and the market value of the underlying securities.… [W]hen a holder purchases with a view to distribution, it is acting as an underwriter and is unable to rely on the Section 4(a)(1) exemption from registration.”). Unlike the September 2018 Note, the April 2021 Note contained the extra requirement that DarkPulse pay to FirstFire 60,000,000 “commitment shares” upon execution of the April 2021 Note. See EXH. 2, SPA at 1, section C. On the date of execution of the April 2021 Note, DarkPulse stock was trading at a price of $0.019 per share, giving the 60,000,000 commitment shares a face value of $1,140,000.12 FirstFire’s requirement that DarkPulse remit these shares (which"

      "summary": "The complaint is a comprehensive securities class action filed by Lead Plaintiffs Handelsbanken Fonder AB, Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, State of Rhode Island, and Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund against Wells Fargo and several of its top executives: Timothy J. Sloan (former CEO), John R. Shrewsberry (CFO), Charles W. Scharf (current CEO), C. Allen Parker (former interim CEO and General Counsel), and Elizabeth “Betsy” Duke (former Board Chair). The plaintiffs allege that from February 2, 2018 to March 12, 2020 (the “Class Period”), the defendants made a series of materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Wells Fargo’s purported compliance with three 2018 regulatory consent orders issued by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), collectively referred to as the “2018 Consent Orders.” These consent orders were imposed in response to Wells Fargo’s widespread consumer abuses, including the notorious fake accounts scandal and other illegal banking practices. The complaint meticulously details the three-stage compliance process mandated by the consent orders, emphasizing that Wells Fargo repeatedly failed to advance beyond Stage 1 due to the regulators’ consistent rejection of its proposed plans as materially incomplete, inadequate, and lacking in substance. Despite this, the defendants allegedly assured investors that the bank was in compliance, had plans in place, and was executing or implementing those plans, thereby concealing the regulators’ stern rebukes, threats of further enforcement action, and the bank’s ongoing non-compliance. The complaint is bolstered by extensive evidence from a year-long investigation by the House Financial Services Committee, which included internal Wells Fargo and regulator documents, interviews with key executives and directors, and testimony from regulatory officials. The House Reports concluded that Wells Fargo’s public statements were “incomplete,” “inaccurate,” and “misleading,” and that the bank’s proposed plans were “shoddy” and “incomplete.” The committee found that even as of March 2020, the regulators had not approved Wells Fargo’s Stage 1 Plan proposals under the 2018 Consent Orders. The complaint also details the significant financial impact of the asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve, which severely limited Wells Fargo’s growth and profitability, and the resulting steep decline in the bank’s stock price as the truth was gradually revealed through a series of partial disclosures, including earnings calls, congressional hearings, and the release of the House Reports. The legal claims asserted in the complaint are violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against Wells Fargo, Sloan, Parker, Duke, and Shrewsberry, and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Insider Defendants (Sloan, Parker, Duke, Shrewsberry, and Scharf). The class period spans from February 2, 2018 to March 12, 2020, during which investors allegedly suffered over $54 billion in market capitalization losses as the truth about Wells Fargo’s non-compliance with the 2018 Consent Orders emerged.",

      "summary": "Lead Plaintiff Steven Christiansen (“Plaintiff”), on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated investors, by and through Plaintiff’s counsel, alleges the following upon information and belief, except as to those allegations concerning Plaintiff, which are alleged upon personal knowledge. The investigation of counsel included, among other things: 1) a review of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (“Spectrum” or the “Company”) public filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); 2) press releases issued by the Company, and media, news and analyst reports about the Company; 3) Spectrum quarterly earnings conference calls, and investor conferences with Company executives, and analysts and investors; 4) information based on consultation with experts in loss causation and economic loss; 5) publicly available information relating to the September 22, 2022 virtual meeting of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (defined below), including the transcript of the virtual meeting and the FDA’s briefing document (defined below); and 6) other publicly available data, including, but not limited to, publicly available trading data relating to the price and trading volume of Spectrum’s common stock. Plaintiff believes that substantial additional evidentiary support will exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportunity for discovery. I. OVERVIEW OF THE CLAIMS 1. This is a securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of Spectrum common stock during the period March 17, 2022 through September 22, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), who were damaged thereby (the “Class”). The claims asserted in this consolidated action (the “Action”) are alleged against Spectrum, Thomas J. Riga (“Riga”), the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and a member of the Company’s board of directors, Francois J. Lebel (“Lebel”), the Company’s former Executive Vice President (“EVP”) and former Chief Medical Officer (“CMO”), and Nora E. Brennan (“Brennan”), the Company’s EVP and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and former member of the Company’s board of directors, and arise under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, promulgated thereunder.  purports to be an inhibitor of certain cellular activity linked to cellular growth (called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI) in NSCLC. Before any new drug can be marketed and sold commercially in the U.S., the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) requires that the drug undergo clinical trials involving three phases of human testing, with each phase involving increasingly larger patient pools. Typically, Phase 1 trials test the safety, dose tolerance, and other properties of the drug; Phase 2 trials seek to gather information about efficacy, optimal dosage levels, adverse effects, and safety risks; and Phase 3 trials are designed to gather further efficacy and safety information used to evaluate a drug’s overall benefit/risk profile. In a Phase 3 trial involving anti-cancer drugs, the drug candidate is typically compared to a standard, FDA-approved treatment for the target disease to verify clinical benefit or lack of benefit, and study patients are randomly assigned to receive the drug candidate or the standard of care treatment. After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective, a new drug application (“NDA”) can be filed with the FDA requesting approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease. However, in cases where a drug candidate treats a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need, the FDA developed the Accelerated Approval (“AA”) pathway for earlier approval of drugs that demonstrate an effect on an endpoint (a measurement of benefit) reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. AA is typically based on Phase 2 study data results. For a drug candidate granted approval under the AA pathway, the FDA has postmarketing requirements (“PMR”), which are typically additional studies or clinical trials designed to confirm or verify clinical benefit. PMRs are typically one or more Phase 3 randomized controlled studies, referred to as confirmatory studies or trials. FDA guidance provides that at the time AA is granted, a Phase confirmatory trial should already be underway because Phase 3 confirmatory trials that are in progress at the time AA is granted are more likely to result in a timely verification of benefit, and mitigate the risks that patients are exposed to undue risks by an ineffective drug granted AA. In or around October 2017, Spectrum commenced a clinical development program for pozi that included a Phase 2 study of pozi’s efficacy and safety, referred to as Cohort 2. Cohort comprised 90 patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations and all patients were to be treated with 16 mg of pozi QD (“QD” is once per day). In a July 27, 2020 press release, Spectrum stated that Cohort 2 had met its primary endpoint (27.8% of patients experienced reduction in tumor size), and in December 2020, Spectrum disclosed that the FDA allowed the Company to file an NDA based on the Cohort 2 study data results under the AA pathway. On November 24, 2021, Spectrum completed its submission of the NDA for pozi at a 16 mg QD dose in patients with previously treated NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations (the “Pozi NDA”), and sought AA for the 16 mg QD dose based on the Phase 2 study data results from Cohort 2. Spectrum’s PMR, or Phase 3 confirmatory trial, was called the PINNACLE Study. In November 2021, during Spectrum’s earnings conference call with investors announcing the Company’s third quarter 2021 financial results, an analyst asked Defendant Lebel, the Company’s CMO, “what confirmatory study are you committing to in terms of design? Because obviously you need to do that as part of the [AA]?” In response, Defendant Lebel stated: . . . we’re in discussion with the [FDA] regarding this, and we clearly have developed a PMR [(the PINNACLE Study)]. And when you file the NDA, you have to have a PMR essentially underway and so we absolutely intend to do that. But obviously, want to make sure we’re in complete agreement . . . as to the nature of the PMR. So I’m not going to go any further on that, but it’s probably a randomized controlled study . . . And we’ll need to define that with the [FDA] and probably quite soon, you will be able to see what we’re doing. In February 2022, Spectrum told investors that the FDA had accepted the Pozi NDA for review, that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA set November 24, (referred to as the PDUFA date) as the date by which the FDA would approve the Pozi NDA, reject it, or ",

      "summary": "The case involves a securities class action against DocGo Inc. and its former executives, including President and CEO Anthony Capone, Chairman and former CEO Stan Vashovsky, and former CFO Andre Oberholzer. The proposed class consists of investors who purchased DocGo common stock between November 8, 2022, and September 17, 2023. The complaint alleges that Capone fabricated his educational background, falsely claiming a graduate degree in computational learning theory from Clarkson University, which he had not earned. This false credential was touted to investors and customers as a key differentiator in DocGo's AI-driven technology platform. The complaint also alleges that Capone inflated the value of a prospective $4 billion contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and falsely claimed that DocGo had signed up thousands of migrants for New York State Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare, which was untrue. These misrepresentations were made to bolster DocGo's prospects and capabilities in the rapidly growing field of AI and to reassure investors about the company's performance and future prospects, particularly as the company transitioned its Mobile Health segment away from COVID-19 services. The complaint asserts claims under §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, seeking damages for the decline in DocGo's stock price following corrective disclosures about Capone's credentials and the value of the CBP contract.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"information and belief is based upon, inter alia, counsel’s investigation, which includes: (a) review and analysis of regulatory filings made by Mobileye with the SEC; (b) press releases, presentations, and media reports issued and disseminated by the Company; (c) analyst and media reports concerning Mobileye; (d) other public information concerning Mobileye; (e) transcripts of Mobileye’s investor and analyst conference calls; (f) Lead Counsel’s review and analysis of trading data for Mobileye securities and related documents; (g) consultations with relevant experts and consultants; (h) Lead Counsel’s communications with knowledgeable individuals, including former employees of Mobileye and the Company’s customers; and (i) other sources. PART ONE: CLAIMS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 This action arises from a series of material misrepresentations by Mobileye and its senior executives. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and misleading statements assuring investors that Mobileye’s sales were based on true market demand, and in turn touting Mobileye’s “record” sales volume and revenue growth. In reality, Mobileye had experienced stalling demand for its flagship product, and Defendants were engaged in a channel stuffing scheme, by which they shipped millions of units (and recognized hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) above true market demand for the product, and even over the objections of Mobileye’s customers. When the full truth emerged, the Company’s sales plummeted, and Mobileye’s stock price collapsed by 70%, erasing all gains it had experienced since the Company’s Initial Public Offering two years earlier. Mobileye is the dominant provider of advanced driver-assistance systems (“ADAS”). ADAS refers to technology incorporated into cars and other automobiles to provide safety features, such as lane departure warnings and alarms that alert drivers to obstacles. Mobileye designs and sells software and hardware that implements those features on vehicles. Approximately 90% of Mobileye’s revenue came from the Company’s proprietary “EyeQ” silicon chips. Mobileye’s primary customers for those chips are a handful of “Tier 1” suppliers, companies in the automotive supply chain that work directly with automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). For decades, suppliers and manufacturers in the automotive supply chain have focused on improving efficiency and minimizing disruptions to the supply chain by implementing standardized protocols to regularly exchange information concerning near- and long-term manufacturing demands and the inventory on hand available to satisfy those demands. These processes and communications became even more important following disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, with key players up and down the supply chain publicly emphasizing the need for even greater communication to ensure effective operations. The Class Period begins on January 26, 2023, when Mobileye announced its year- end 2022 earnings. That day, Defendants touted “better than expected” revenue growth, driven in large part by increased sales of the Company’s flagship EyeQ chips. Defendants also provided positive financial guidance for 2023, guiding the market to approximately a 20% increase in revenue year-over-year, which they stated was actually “conservative.” These representations were particularly meaningful to investors because Mobileye had only just been spun off from Intel Corporation into an independent public company three months earlier, and this was Mobileye’s first full reporting period earnings release and first full-year guidance since the spin-off. Thus, investors looking to value the Company focused particularly on the Company’s historical and expected growth, which the market understood to reflect the demand for Mobileye’s products. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants touted their visibility into demand for Mobileye’s products and existing inventory levels. Defendants repeatedly reassured the market that they were “monitoring inventory levels on an ongoing basis” and analyzing demand for Mobileye’s EyeQ chips. Defendants also represented to investors that Mobileye’s customers had “so much capacity” to buy more of Mobileye’s products. This, combined with Defendants’ frequent representations that they were in “continuous contact with customers” to “balance” and “stabilize” the quantities of product shipped to customers, conveyed to investors that (i) Mobileye’s customers had not reached their capacity for EyeQ chips; and (ii) Mobileye was tracking demand for the EyeQ chip and matching its shipments to that demand. In fact, Mobileye assured investors it did exactly that: from the beginning of the Class Period, Defendants told investors that the number of chips that Mobileye shipped would “depend upon market conditions.” These representations were important to investors because they reassured the market that Mobileye’s sales to its customers were based on actual demand. Thus, these statements provided assurance as to the quality and nature of Mobileye’s present revenue, as well as to the sustainability of the Company’s growth, which was critical to the market’s valuation of this newly-launched Company. Mobileye’s strong outlook, growth story, and Defendants’ assurances about their visibility into the demand for the Company’s products impressed analysts and investors. As a result, Mobileye’s stock price climbed. Unknown to investors, however, Defendants’ statements were false. In truth, Mobileye’s shipments did not “depend upon market conditions.” Instead, Mobileye’s recent success was built on a multi-year channel stuffing scheme. The scheme was simple: to insulate Mobileye from the risks of market fluctuations caused by pandemic-era supply chain constraints in the leadup to the Company’s IPO, Defendants abandoned Mobileye’s historical practices of taking quarterly orders from its Tier 1 customers, and instead forced customers to enter into annual minimum quantity purchasing commitments. In 2022, Mobileye began to require its customers to commit to buying a minimum number of EyeQ chips at the beginning of the year—regardless of what demand would actually be. As Defendants would later admit, these minimum commitment deals made it “impossible” for the Tier 1 customers to adjust orders to demand during the year. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Mobileye refused to adjust the commitment quantities, even as the market for ADAS chips fell precipitously and Mobileye’s customers complained repeatedly. If Tier 1 customers had not ordered enough EyeQ chips to satisfy their minimum commitments by the end of the year, Mobileye would simply ship the number of chips remaining under these commitments, even when the customer did not order those chips and had no demand for them. These facts are confirmed by well-placed witnesses both inside of Mobileye and at one of Mobileye’s largest customers. The scheme was effective: by untethering supply from demand, Mobileye sold more EyeQ chips and generated more revenue than ever in 2022, leading to a successful IPO. By the start of the Class Period in January 2023, Defendants had shipped four to five million EyeQ chips in excess of market demand. Without the volume and revenue from these forced sales, Mobileye would have missed guidance and analyst predictions. Buoyed by this achievement, Mobileye required its customers to sign another year of minimum commitment deals in 2023. Once again, artificially propped up by these imposed and atypical agreements, Mobileye shattered its sales and revenue records as it shipped an additional two to three million EyeQ chips in excess of demand and which its customers did not need or want. All told, Mobileye recognized hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue by shipping excess inventory that its customers did not need or want. These preordained sales grossly exaggerated Mobileye’s growth and enabled the Company to precisely meet guidance and analyst expectations during each quarter of 2023—but only by secretly cannibalizing future revenue. The scheme, however, unraveled: by January 2024, Defendants’ channel-stuffing scheme began to fall apart as customers had built up too much inventory and stopped signing annual agreements. On January 4, 2024, Defendants announced that the Company’s 2024 revenue would actually stall and even decline compared to 2023, because Mobileye had for years shipped millions of EyeQ chips more than the market could bear. As a result of Defendants’ scheme, customers refused to buy more chips from Mobileye until they worked through the considerable excess inventory that Mobileye had forced into the channel. Analysts were stunned. Just the day before this announcement, CNBC had published an article lauding Mobileye’s “rare secular growth story” and valuable “long-term growth prospects,” quoting (among others) an analyst from Deutsche Bank, who praised Mobileye as “the stock that’ll be the ‘last man standing’ in autonomous driving.” But in response to Defendants’ unexpected revelation about the excess inventory, that same analyst at Deutsche Bank immediately recognized that Mobileye’s revenue had for years been “inflated compared with real demand,” and explained that Defendants had provided “no advance notice of any building inventory issues.” Likewise, analysts at TD Cowen “struggle[d] with how Mobileye could so poorly align its EyeQ shipments with end vehicle production to this extent,” while Morgan Stanley exclaimed: “We cannot recall another example of an established supplier guiding down 50pct for a quarter . . . due to excess inventory in the channel.” As a result of this revelation, Mobileye’s stock price fell $9.75 per share, or 24.5%, to close at $29.97 per share on January 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume. The shocked reaction by analysts—and exasperation that Defendants had provided no advance notice of the buildup—reflected in part that widely-adopted industry standards and practices within the automotive supply chain had for decades required regular communications within all levels of the supply chain as to the inventory on-hand and forecasted demand. Several of Mobileye’s top Tier 1 customers publicly affirmed their adherence to, and insistence on, these industry practices. Based on industry standard practices—and reassured by Defendants’ statements—the market expected that Defendants should have known throughout the Class Period that its customers had more inventory than needed. On January 25, 2024, Defendants held their first earnings call after revealing the devastating impact to revenue caused by the excess inventory. Defendants revealed that they had been able to force Mobileye’s customers to accept this excess inventory because the annual minimum commitment deals made it “impossible” for its customers to “adjust[] . . . the quantities” of EyeQ order volumes to correspond to market conditions. During this call, Defendants went out of their way to assure investors that the risks of buildup from these mandatory commitments—the scope of which Defendants had only just now revealed to investors—were nonetheless “no longer relevant,” because Mobileye had reverted to its traditional practice of only taking quarterly orders from its customers, which would allow customers to adjust their purchases to changing demand levels. In truth, the quarterly deals simply made it harder for Defendants to shift the risk of changing market conditions—and declining ADAS market share—onto Mobileye’s customers. Defendants continued to conceal the full scope and impact of their scheme, claiming that the inventory buildup was created by purposeful decisions on the part of the Tier 1 customers, and assuring investors that customers would work through the excess inventory within months. On August 1, 2024, Defendants were forced to reveal that these assurances were false. That day, Defendants shockingly reduced their 2024 revenue guidance even lower, yet again with the EyeQ as the cause: unable to force millions of chips onto its customers as they had for years, EyeQ volumes and orders remained low. Analysts were once again floored by Defendants’ announcement and quickly connected the news to the excess inventory previously announced. They harshly criticized Defendants’ latest disclosure, stating that there was “No way to sugarcoat it—we struggle to rationalize a second material cut to 2024 guidance this year” and that “Another significant guide down following the miss entering the year is tough to swallow.” Analysts lamented that the repeated guidance reduction for EyeQ chip sales was the “particular disappointment” of Defendants’ announcement and noted that “the shock from the January 2024 guide down on an outsized inventory build at customers in MBLY’s core EyeQ business was a clear negative for the credibility of mgmt with investors.” They further lamented that Mobileye was “increasingly being seen as a market-share loser in base ADAS.” On this news, Mobileye’s stock price fell $4.72 per share, or 22.5%, to close at $16.28 per share on August 1, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume. As a result of these disclosures, Mobileye’s stock price declined by almost 70% in total from its Class Period high, and has not recovered to this day. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This action arises under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, promulgated under the Exchange Act. This Court has jurisdiction over the Exchange Act claims pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and (c). At all relevant times, Mobileye conducted substantial business here. In addition, many of the acts alleged herein occurred in this District. In connection with the acts and conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including but not limited to the U.S. mails, interstate telephone communications, and the facilities of the national securities exchanges and markets. III. PARTIES Lead Plaintiff The Retirement Plan for Chicago Transit Authority Employees (defined above as “Chicago Transit” or “Lead Plaintiff”) is a pension fund organized for the benefit of eligible employees of the Chicago Transit Authority. As of September 30, 2023, Chicago Transit managed approximately $1.9 billion in assets. As indicated in the certification filed as Exhibit A to this Complaint, Chicago Transit purchased shares of Mobileye Class A common stock at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period and suffered damages as a result of the violations of the federal securities laws alleged herein. Defendant Mobileye Global Inc. (“Mobileye”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal executive offices located in Jerusalem, Israel. Mobileye’s Class A common currently stock trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “MBLY.” Defendant Amnon Shashua (“Shashua”) is the co-founder, President, Director and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Mobileye. Defendant Moran Shemesh Rojansky (“Rojansky”) has been Mobileye’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) since September 11, 2023. Prior to that, Defendant Rojansky was the Company’s interim CFO from June 26, 2023 until September 11, 2023, and Vice President of Finance, Director of Finance and Corporate Controller from 2016 until June 26, 2023. Defendant Anat Heller (“Heller”) was Mobileye’s CFO from 2018 until June 26, Prior to that, she held various positions with the Company beginning in 2016, including as Vice President of Finance, Director of Finance and Corporate Controller. Defendant Daniel Galves (“Galves”) has been Mobileye’s Chief Communications Officer since March 2022. He originally joined Mobileye in early 2016 and led Investor Relations and Communications for Mobileye until 2018. After the Intel acquisition, he worked for Wolfe Research before eventually returning to Mobileye in 2022. Defendants Shashua, Rojansky, Heller, and Galves are collectively referred to herein as the “Executive Defendants” and, together with Mobileye, as the “Defendants.” The Executive Defendants directly participated in the management of Mobileye’s operations, had direct and supervisory involvement in Mobileye’s day-to-day operations, and had the ability to control and did control Mobileye’s statements to investors. They were each involved in drafting, reviewing, publishing, and/or making the Company’s statements, including the false and misleading statements and omissions alleged herein. IV. SUMMARY OF THE FRAUD Founded in 1999, Mobileye is a technology company that develops and deploys ADAS—which includes safety features such as emergency brake assistance, as well as lane- departure and blind-spot warnings—along with other autonomous driving technologies and solutions. Mobileye first went public in 2014 but was subsequently acquired by Intel Corporation in 2017. Several years later, in October 2022, Intel spun Mobileye off and Mobileye became a standalone public company again (the “IPO”). At all relevant times, Mobileye was the incumbent and dominant player in the ADAS market, repeatedly touting that it held approximately 70% of the market share in the growing ADAS market. Mobileye’s competitors also repeatedly acknowledged Mobileye as the biggest player in the ADAS market. For instance, in its SEC filings, Mobileye identifies Qualcomm and Ambarella as two of its largest competitors. Just before the start of the Class Period, Qualcomm’s CFO described Mobileye as the “incumbent clearly in ADAS.” Likewise, during the Class Period, the CEO of Ambarella readily admitted that Mobileye “really dominate[s] this market.” Based on Mobileye’s overwhelming dominance in ADAS, analysts believed that Mobileye was uniquely positioned to capture even more of the growing ADAS market and concluded that Mobileye’s ADAS market dominance justified a premium price for Mobileye stock. For instance, when they initiated coverage of the Company, analysts from Tigress Financial Partners took note of the “increasing demand for ADAS capabilities” and wrote that Mobileye’s “significant R&D investments, first-mover advantage, and industry-leading product portfolio combined with significant OEM relationships, well-position it to capitalize on a massive market opportunity.” Analysts from Cowen likewise lauded Mobileye as a “rare scaled pure-play and beneficiary of ADAS/autonomy,” stating that Mobileye’s “[s]trong growth and a wide data moat” meant that it would be difficult for competitors to steal business from Mobileye. Nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue comes from the Company’s proprietary EyeQ system-on-chip (the “EyeQ”). First launched in 2007, the EyeQ is essentially a combination of hardware and software which allows car manufacturers to implement ADAS features into their vehicles. While the EyeQ is not Mobileye’s only product, the EyeQ is “fundamental to [Mobileye’s] leadership position in ADAS,” as the Company has explained, and critical to its performance. For instance, in 2022, Mobileye sold approximately 33 million EyeQ chips, which made up 89% of its reported revenue of $1.9 billion. Almost all of the Company’s remaining revenue comes from sales of Mobileye’s SuperVision system, a more advanced autonomous driving system which itself utilizes EyeQ technology. In other words, EyeQ chips drive nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue. Mobileye primarily sells the EyeQ chip to “Tier 1” automotive suppliers, who function essentially as intermediaries between Mobileye (a “Tier 2” supplier) and car manufacturers (known as Original Equipment Manufacturers or “OEMs”), which include companies such as Ford or Volkswagen. The graphic below illustrates the relevant portion of the Mobileye and EyeQ supply chain. As Mobileye disclosed in its SEC filings, the Company relied significantly on sales to a handful of Tier 1 customers, including Aptiv PLC, Magna International, Valeo, and ZF Group. The overwhelming majority of Mobileye’s revenue comes"

      "summary": "Plaintiffs bring this securities class action alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants knowingly and materially misrepresented the success of changes to American’s sales distribution strategy to investors. American is one of the United States’ three largest providers of air transportation for passengers and cargo. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing for passenger airfare against the other two largest providers of airfare—United Airlines and Delta—as well as with low-cost carriers and ultra low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines, respectively. Prior to the Class Period, American traditionally sold airfare and ancillary services to corporate customers through third party distributors who used global distributions systems (“GDSs”), centralized platforms that act as middlemen between travel agencies and airlines. These GDSs relied on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (“EDIFACT”), a universal language for data sharing, to exchange information regarding airfare and ancillary services. This traditional method for distributing airfare and ancillary services is referred to herein as “EDIFACT channels.” Beginning in December 2022 and continuing through Spring of 2024, American made a series of changes to the way it sold airfare and ancillary services to its corporate customers. The Company’s new distribution strategy, coined “Modern Retailing,” aimed to push corporate customers away from booking through EDIFACT channels to booking directly through American’s website, mobile app, or a direct connection with the airline, all of which involved using New Distribution Capability (“NDC”) technology. In theory, changing ticket distribution to an NDC standard could reduce costs paid to GDSs and travel agencies while providing American with more control of the price and presentation of its airfare to its customers. To induce customers to shift to NDC and direct bookings, in April 2023, American removed forty percent of its airfare content from EDIFACT channels and restricted its availability to the Company’s direct and NDC channels. American also implemented changes to booking agreements with travel agencies and corporations who were booking their own travel (either through an in-house corporate travel department, a travel management company (“TMC”), or a travel agency) by reducing the number of incentives those customers previously received for buying American services through EDIFACT channels, in favor of awarding incentives tied to bookings made directly with American or through NDC-enabled channels. From July 2023 through April 2024, Defendants touted the success of their changes to American’s distribution strategy, and issued false earnings guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2024 (“2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance”) that reflected the supposed financial success of their new distribution strategy. Defendants also falsely claimed that they were very encouraged both by third parties’ response to distribution changes and adoption of NDC technology, as well as by corporate customers’ continued demand. For example, speaking of corporate customers, Defendant Raja positively touted “the durability of these customers’ demand” and Defendant Isom stated that “[t]here’s nothing that I see in terms of customer behavior that would suggest that we’re not on the right path.” Defendants continued to echo these claims throughout the Class Period. However, contrary to their public representations, Defendants had no basis for their portrayal of the results from their new distribution strategy, or for their 2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance because American’s distribution strategy changes were driving travel agencies and corporate customers away in droves, and American’s share of business among airlines as a whole was withering. Indeed, confidential witnesses (“CWs”) who were employed by American during the Class Period recounted that American’s relationships with both travel agencies and corporate customers quickly deteriorated after the Company began introducing its distribution changes. For instance, by April 2023, before the Class Period even began, it was clear to CW2 that, as a result of American’s aggressive push towards NDC distribution, agencies and companies were booking fewer flights with American than they had in the past, with some avoiding American entirely. Similarly, CW1 personally “saw share move away swiftly” by TMCs, which predominately cater to business and corporate travelers. This reduction in share became “particularly noticeable” to CW1 in June 2023 and continued thereafter. Similarly, CW1 confirmed that American “lost so much share” of small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) since many were unwilling to stop using agencies. Critically, based on data available to them through American’s SalesLink Insights platform, PRISM reports, and from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) (explained more fully below), Defendants knew that customers were not adopting NDC technology and instead, American was losing market share to competitors. As CW2 explained, by July 2023 bookings from larger agencies declined 15% compared to year-over-year levels, and bookings for corporate accounts were “much lower” than that. CW2 elaborated that PRISM data demonstrated that American’s agency and corporate bookings and percentage of share metrics remained “consistently down” through the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January Moreover, after the Class Period, Defendants admitted to having known that American’s lagging revenue and “softness in customer bookings” were a direct result of “changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that American knew that these issues existed during the first quarter of 2024 but nevertheless obscured the severity of impacts in hopes that the results would reverse, stating in relevant part: “[W]e identified a deviation in terms of our revenue performance versus some of our large network peers in the first quarter” of 2024. Despite knowing about these materially negative effects of the new strategy on their business,, Defendants continued to knowingly misrepresent American’s sales success throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. Indeed, as late as April 25, 2024 (one month before quarter close), the Individual Defendants were asked point blank during an earnings call to describe American’s performance with “managed corporate travel volume” in relation to competitors who reported market share around “14%, 15%.” Defendants did not demur. Rather, Defendant Raja clearly lied, stating, in pertinent part, and in contradiction to information known “in the first quarter,” that such “revenues are coming back very materially for us” including with regard to “corporate contract and corporate customers[.]” At the same time Defendants issued knowingly false financial guidance and, referring to American’s supposedly positive performance with NDC deployment, stated “that’s implicit in our [falsely high] guide for Q2 and for the year.” Just one month later, on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024, Defendants disclosed the truth when reporting that Defendant Raja would be leaving the Company in June 2024 and that American was significantly reducing its guidance for the second quarter of 2024. During the Bernstein Conference (defined in ¶ 205) on May 29, 2024, Defendant Isom confirmed that American was reducing its second quarter guidance and revealed that the Company was slashing its growth estimates for the full year 2024 “due to the changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that, with respect to NDC implementation, American “move[d] faster than we should and we didn’t execute well[,]” “used a lot of sticks[,]” and that its “approach [was and] is driving customers away from American.” During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, Defendant Isom also linked Raja’s departure to American driving customers away with the changes to its agency and corporate strategy. Upon this news, American’s stock dropped dramatically, falling from a closing price of $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May 29, 2024 and resulting in American’s largest single-day drop since June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic decimated travel demand. As Defendant Isom would later admit during the Company’s July 25, 2Q 2024 Earnings Call (defined in ¶ 219) American’s guidance reduction was directly related to the Company’s changes to its distribution strategy—not general air travel market factors. Indeed, American’s competitor, United Airlines, reaffirmed its guidance within minutes of American’s May 28, 2024 announcement—ostensibly at the ready for American’s disclosure of the truth. Analysts reacted swiftly. For instance, in a May 28, 2024 report, Bernstein analysts were surprised by the extent of American’s guidance reduction, stating in relevant part: “[a] significant miss driven in part by close in bookings[,]” i.e., bookings that are made close in time to a flight date (frequently used for corporate fliers), which “puts AAL’s ability to reap the full value of a robust summer flying season in greater doubt” and further attributed the “close in booking weakness … to loss of corporate travel share associated with recent distribution strategy changes (positive read across to DAL/UAL[Delta/United]).” Barclays wrote in a report published on May 30, 2024 that “a relevant contributor to the revenue weakness[]” was American’s NDC strategy during the Class Period, noting that American was now “abandoning its ‘modern retailing approach’ and that the CCO has left.” Barclays further observed “[n]o other airline has followed this path[,]” that “American’s revenue guidance was very out of kilter with peers,” and that “the issue was [American’s] guidance not the reality of the travel market.” Moreover, after the Class Period on July 25, 2024, Defendant Isom disclosed the full impact of American’s disastrous distribution strategy when reporting American’s operating results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. There, Defendant Isom disclosed that, as a result of the Company’s distribution strategy changes, American lost $750 million in revenue during the first half of 2024, and was expected to experience another $750 million impact to revenue for the second half of 2024. Isom further admitted that American had ceded market share from agencies and corporate customers to its competitors during the Class Period and stated that, in an effort to regain that share, American was reversing the changes to its distribution strategy. Defendants’ fraud caused investors to purchase American securities at artificially inflated prices and suffer immense financial harm thereby. Plaintiffs now seek damages individually and on behalf of the Class. II.
