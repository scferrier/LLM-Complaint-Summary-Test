      "summary": "Carvana is an e-commerce company that sells used cars. Unlike traditional dealerships, Carvana’s model is full of competitive advantages, such as a “capital-light” expansion model, a scalable business model, and a groundbreaking logistics network that could readily deliver or pick-up cars nationwide. Carvana was founded by Garcia Senior and his son, Garcia Junior, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garcia Senior’s other used car business, DriveTime. As DriveTime was facing millions of dollars in fines for violating federal laws and increased oversight, Garcia Senior spun off Carvana. Then, the father-and-son team took Carvana public. But Garcia Senior had a problem. His prior federal felony conviction for fraud barred him from employment at any NYSE listed company. Thus, Garcia Senior – Carvana’s unofficial chairman – installed his son as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman, designed Carvana’s voting structure so that he maintained more than 80% of the voting power, became Carvana’s largest shareholder, and appointed his loyal friends (and partner in crime) as board members. After going public, Defendants continued to tout their “bigger is better” growth story. Immediately before the Class Period, however, Defendants faced a dilemma as investors were concerned that Carvana’s retail sales growth was slowing. As a Morgan Stanley analyst noted on February 27, 2020, if Carvana’s “growth starts to slow significantly, and the company is still not profitable, there will be a transition away from growth investors, and how investors think about the valuation of the stock will change.” Defendants could not let this happen; they needed the Company to have a high valuation so they could cash out their personal holdings in Carvana stock at a top dollar. Thus, Defendants planned and executed a scheme to inflate the Company’s retail vehicle sales while concealing the unsustainability of Carvana’s model and the many devastating consequences of their scheme. Weeks before the start of the Class Period, Defendant Garcia Senior partnered with his son to orchestrate a direct offering that allowed Garcia Senior to purchase stock pre-Class Period at a depressed price that he would later sell at inflated prices during the Class Period. As the Class Period began, Defendants embarked on their scheme to inflate Carvana’s retail sales, and thus, Carvana’s stock price. While Defendants disclosed the Company’s focus on retail sales growth, Defendants concealed that it required a series of unsustainable machinations to accelerate this growth, including: “frequently acquiring sales that were less profitable”; abruptly escalating the number of cars purchased from customers to induce trade-ins by lowering the Company’s purchasing and verification standards, and buying “as much as was humanly possible”; launching a rapid and unsustainable nationwide expansion plan to enter over 150 new markets even though the Company lacked the necessary infrastructure to serve many of these markets; violating state title and registration laws to quickly push through sales; and entering into a pass-through sales arrangement with the Garcias’ DriveTime to sell thousands of cars with no benefit to Carvana except for the boost to its reported unit sales. At the same time that Defendants inflated Carvana’s retail unit growth, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business. Specifically, Defendants exalted Carvana’s increases in retail sales and masked its actual gross profits per retail unit, while touting the efficiencies and capabilities of its groundbreaking logistics network and “capital-light” expansion model. Defendants’ assurances were aimed at convincing investors that Carvana’s growth was sustainable. After all, if Carvana could pair its explosive unit growth with purported profitability, and a scalable logistics model that could expand across the country efficiently and cost effectively, the sky was the limit. Defendants’ limitless growth story produced its desired results. Carvana’s retail sales growth skyrocketed, propelling Carvana to be named as one of the fastest companies to ever make the Fortune 500 list based on organic growth alone, along with Google and Amazon. Naturally, Carvana’s stock price soared, rising as high as $376 per share during the Class Period. And Defendants took full advantage of the artificially inflated stock price by dumping more than $3.87 billion of their personally held shares on unsuspecting investors. Garcia Senior alone reaped more than $3.6 billion in insider sales proceeds. Daniel Taylor, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of Business and director of the Wharton Forensic Analytics Lab, explained to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal that Garcia Senior’s insider trades were nefarious, concluding: “What I’m saying is the Garcias knew it was short-lived. The Garcias knew the music would eventually end.” And the music did end – with a thud. Through a series of partial disclosures, investors began to learn that Carvana was a very different company from the one they were sold. Defendants’ “bigger is better” Amazon-comparison story was a fiction. Ultimately, Defendants admitted that Carvana’s retail sales growth was unsustainable – indeed, by the end of the Class Period, retail sales were significantly declining. Defendants acknowledged that Carvana’s “capital-light” market expansion model was a farce, and Carvana was forced to issue billions of dollars of high-interest junk bonds to acquire a nationwide auction house, ADESA, to backfill its deficient infrastructure. By the time the truth about Carvana’s growth, profitability, and business model was revealed, the price of Carvana’s Class A common stock had plummeted from a Class Period high of $376 per share to $7.39 per share, representing a decline of more than 97%, leaving the Company on the verge of bankruptcy. While investors suffered billions of dollars in damages, Defendants’ fraudulent conduct permitted them to walk away with billions of dollars. Plaintiffs seek to recover those damages on behalf of the putative Class through this action.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This case arises out of Netflix’s alleged material misrepresentations and omissions concerning the extent of account sharing on the Company’s platform and its impact on Netflix’s subscriber growth. Netflix primarily operates an entertainment streaming platform that offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games across a variety of genres and languages in over 190 countries. It also offers a DVD-by-mail service in the U.S. The Company allowed members to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. During the Class Period, members could play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Netflix has one operating segment. During the Class Period, its revenues were primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to its members. Netflix defines a paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) as having “the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members.” Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. During the Class Period, Netflix provided quarterly guidance for paid net membership additions or “paid net adds.” Paid net adds was the number of paid new memberships added each quarter minus those it lost due to cancellations, or more simply acquisition minus churn. Netflix did not report specific figures for acquisition and churn, but paid net adds combined the two. Churn was often discussed in terms of its counterpart – retention. Netflix also reported on how users engaged with its platform. Engagement was measured by the number of accounts that viewed a title until the end of 2021, when it changed the metric to measure the number of hours viewed per title. Engagement was often discussed as viewing or views. Netflix considered acquisition, churn, and engagement important metrics to gauge the health of the business. For example, on the January 19, 2021 Q4’20 earnings call, Neumann noted “viewing is up in every region of the world. . . . Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business[.]” On the January 19, 2021 Q4’20 earnings call, Neumann explained that Netflix used these metrics to determine when to increase prices, stating, “So you think about engagement with the service and retention and churn characteristics, acquisition. Those are the things that we’re really looking for that are key to basically saying, ‘okay, we’ve added more value in the service. Now it’s the right time to go back to those members and ask them to pay a little bit more so that we can reinvest it and keep adding it.’” Later, at the March 8, 2022 Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Neumann claimed that “the business is healthy” and noted that “engagement [was] up over the prior year and pre-COVID. Retention or churn levels [were] lower than prior year in pre-COVID, and that was everywhere around the world. And so that -- those are the kind of metrics we’re looking at.” In reporting its results, the Company broke down its members into four geographic regions: the Unites States and Canada (“UCAN”); Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America (“LATAM”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). During the Class Period, the Company estimated that its total addressable market (“TAM”) outside of China was approximately 800 million to 900 million broadband households, and the TAM in the UCAN was estimated to be approximately 125 million broadband households. UCAN was Netflix’s most penetrated region – where it had captured the largest share of the TAM. During the January 19, 2021 Q4’20 earnings call, Neumann stated that in the “UCAN market, we’re roughly 60% penetrated,” and he acknowledged on the October 19, 2021 Q3’21 earnings call that “Latin America and UCAN . . . are a bit more mature, more tenured, more penetrated[.]” Nevertheless, throughout the Class Period, the Defendants assured that there was “a lot of headroom in all of these markets” and that in every region, including UCAN, there was “ample runway for growth.” Growing subscribers outside of UCAN required Netflix to expand its library of local content in those respective markets, which was a longer-term prosect. Hastings reflected on this dynamic on the July 19, 2019 Q2’19 earnings call, stating, “Now do we have enough content in each of those countries? Most of that is local content that gets consumed. . . . So we’ll just take it year-by year and try to have our net adds continue to grow.” Neumann similarly noted at the March 2, 2020 Morgan Stanley conference “it’s frankly quite early days in these non-U.S. regions in terms of continuing to build that content market for that.” Netflix’s monthly membership prices varied by country. For example, in 2021 its Basic plan was $1.96 per month in Turkey and $12.86 per month in Switzerland, even though both are within the EMEA. Based on its revenues and paid memberships reported on a regional basis for fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021, Netflix’s average revenue per member was $12.91 per month in UCAN, $9.71 per month in EMEA, $7.00 per month in LATAM, and $7.76 per month in APAC. As a result of price increases, in 2021 Netflix’s average revenue per member increased to $14.37 per month in UCAN, $10.92 per month in EMEA, $7.46 per month in LATAM, and $8.34 per month in APAC. Given these disparities, where Netflix was acquiring and losing members was critical to its revenue growth. Throughout the Class Period, UCAN was responsible for ~43-45% of Netflix’s total quarterly revenue. Netflix defined its competition broadly. Its fiscal 2020 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021 stated, “We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.” Many of Netflix’s main competitors had been streaming content for years, including Hulu since 2007, HBO since 2010, and in 2011 Amazon included video streaming content in the price of its Prime membership. Several major new players entered the streaming market in recent years. In November 2019, Disney Plus began streaming Disney’s huge library of content for only $6.99 per month, and for just $12.99 per month, viewers could get the “Disney Bundle” consisting of Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN. Apple TV also entered the market in November 2019 for only $4.99 per month and was seen as a major competitor due to the company’s financial resources and wide distribution network, which included 900 million iPhone users. In July 2020, NBCUniversal launched Peacock, which offered some content for free with ads, and had additional content, including live sports, offered with its Premium package for $4.99 per month with ads and $9.99 per month without ads. In March 2021, ViacomCBS launched Paramount Plus for $4.99 per month with ads and $9.99 per month without ads. While its competitors earned revenue from advertising on their platforms or offered an advertising-free package for an additional cost, Netflix proudly remained free of advertising, and, therefore, its revenue growth depended entirely on continued member acquisition and retention. The Company’s July 17, 2019 Letter to Shareholders proclaimed that remaining advertising free was “a deep part of our brand proposition” and “[w]e believe we will have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction.” The July 17, 2019 Letter to Shareholders told investors that “when you read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false.” Account sharing, also referred to as password sharing, is when paying members share their password with non-paying users who do not reside in their household. Netflix permitted multiple users within the same household to share a single account. On Netflix’s April 22, 2013 Q1’13 earnings call, Hastings explained, “We usually like to think that a husband and wife can share an account and that that’s perfectly appropriate and acceptable. If you mean, ‘hey, I got my password from my boyfriend’s uncle’ then that’s not what we would consider appropriate. And so, we focus on serving the immediate family.” Historically, Netflix’s standard plan allowed members two simultaneous streams. On Netflix’s April 22, 2013 earnings call, Hastings discussed a new plan which provided members with four simultaneous streams for $11.99 per month, a 50% increase from its standard plan which was priced at $7.99 per month. Hasting said, “we expect . . . fewer than 1% of our members to take that plan.” Hastings assured investors that the new plan was designed for people within the same household, noting that “we really don’t think that there’s much going on of the ‘I’m going to share my password with a marginal acquaintance.’” The 4-stream plan was introduced to aid large households, and management acknowledged it would have “exacerbate[d]” account sharing; however, password sharing was not viewed as a significant problem at the time. At a May 15, 2013 conference hosted by J.P. Morgan, Netflix’s then-CFO David Wells (“Wells”) was asked to reconcile the plans allowing “additional streams” with “the sharing of passwords not being an issue in your mind.” Wells replied: Well, we introduced the 4-streaming plan. And it is a very, very small percentage of the base -- we said less than 2% that this would appeal to. And that is based on observations of people actually running into the cap of two simultaneous streams and also calls to our customer service center. So it is a very small percentage of the base. It solves a problem for very large families and households. And with respect and relative to password sharing, honestly, if password sharing were a bigger problem, the 4-stream actually might exacerbate that because then -- now you are allowing even more people to share one common plan. So if we felt like that was a huge problem, it would have factored into the calculus of releasing a 4-stream plan. I don’t -- our observation and our view is that password sharing is not quite as large as has been out there, floated out there. When Netflix introduced a $6.99 plan, allowing streaming only on one screen, in December 2013, media speculated that the subscription tier “means you might have to say goodbye to ‘sharing’ accounts your friends and family.” But management denied that the $6.99 plan was responsive to account sharing or Netflix’s penetration in U.S. On the January 22, 2014 Q4’13 earnings call, Hastings was asked who the $6.99 plan was targeting and if it was reflective of “your view in terms of penetration or maturity in the US?” Hastings replied, “[w]e’re testing lots of things. . . . One of the things is the $6.99 one stream, I don’t think you should read too much into that other then [sic] we’re probing around the edges. There’s no definite plan to do that. I would say generally as we put in the letter we’re trying to figure out some models of good, better, best price tiering that makes sense and provide some flexibility for our customers, at least for our new customers.” As reflected in the chart below, Netflix implemented numerous pricing increases for its Basic, Standard, and Premium plans in UCAN over the years. The primary distinction between Netflix’s pricing plans was the number of simultaneous streams allowed, allowing anyone with access to the member’s password to use their account, provided that the account had not reached its maximum number of simultaneous streams. In fact, “[w]e love people sharing Netflix” and “That’s a positive thing, not a negative thing,” Hastings told reporters at the Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”) on January 6, 2016. Hastings assured these users would eventually become paying members, stating, “As kids move on in their life, they like to have control of their life, and as they have an income, we see them separately subscribe. . . . It really hasn’t been a problem.” CNET published an article discussing Hastings’ CES comments on January 6, 2016, which acknowledged that the number of simultaneous streams did impose a limit on account sharing: “Netflix, of course, does try to curb how widely passwords are shared. A standard account that costs $9.99 a month allows users to watch videos on two screens simultaneously. For an additional $2 a month, you can upgrade to four screens.” Account sharing was not “a material inhibitor to [Netflix’s] growth,” according to Wells speaking at the January 6, 2016 Citi Internet, Media, and Telecommunications Conference. He stated: [I]n terms of password protection, we haven’t been as focused on it as you guys have. That isn’t to say that we don’t look at it and have a point of view. It is just we don’t feel like it is a material inhibitor to our growth. That might not be true forever. But even if we were to identify it and know it for sure when we see it, that is different than turning that person into a paid subscriber. At the same conference, Wells indicated that allowing multiple profiles enabled account sharing, but hoped the quality and low-cost of the service would encourage people to get their own account: And for us, we want to enable the allowed use cases of within household. Certainly having your 35-year-old daughter’s boyfriend’s cousin use Netflix is not in the acceptable use cases. And so, it is a matter of trying to make our recommendations and a recommendation engine in that profile so compelling that for a low-cost service, ‘my God, how cheap are you? Can’t you go get your own Netflix?’ That is the dialogue we would want to have happening in the household. Analysts continued to ask whether the Company would take steps to limit account sharing. The analyst at the September 20, 2016 Goldman Sachs Conference noted that “adding individual profiles within a single account -- almost seems to encourage [password sharing]” and wondered if Netflix would need to “start tightening the noose in terms of things like simultaneous streams[.]” Wells contended that “there is a hard constraint today in the number of concurrent streams” and reiterated “predominantly we just focused on making it -- the service doesn’t cost that much, so why don’t you get your own?” Wells also noted “We could crack down on it, but you wouldn’t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users.” Hastings again dismissed concerns about account sharing on an October 17, 2016 Q3’16 earnings call, stating “No plans on making any changes there. Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because there’s so much legitimate password sharing like, you know, you sharing with your spouse, with your kids, so there’s no bright line and we’re doing fine as is.” Similarly, on Netflix’s October 16, 2017 Q3’17 earnings call, an analyst noted “the question I get asked a lot is whether password-sharing is an issue” and asked if price increases reflected that Netflix was “making password sharing more expensive?” Peters denied this was the case stating, “password sharing isn’t a huge issue for us right now. It’s not a huge priority to go try and take significant measure to try and stem it. We think that a broader spread in pricing better reflects the value that we’re delivering in the higher tiers[.]” Underscoring the investing public’s interest in account sharing and its impact on subscriber growth, market observers often estimated the amount of account sharing and the associated lost revenue. An August 19, 2018 CNBC article noted: An estimated 35 percent of millennials share passwords for streaming services. That’s compared with 19 percent of Generation X subscribers and 13 percent of Baby Boomers. Media experts struggle to pinpoint an exact cost, and Netflix and HBO executives have gone on record to dispel concerns. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in 2016 password sharing “hasn’t been a problem” and could convince new users to buy in. A January 15, 2019 Yahoo Finance article discussing a survey conducted by cordcutting.com which asked 1,127 U.S. based people aged 18 to 81 about their streaming usage and estimated that 24 million people who used Netflix did not pay for it. The article stated, “Freeloading off other people deprives Netflix (NFLX) of at least $2.3 billion in revenue each year[.]” On January 9, 2019, Cybersecurity Insiders published an online article reporting that “In order to curb such [password sharing] practices and safeguard revenues, Netflix has decided to use Synamedia’s Credential Sharing behavioral analytics and machine learning software to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services.” The article stated: “Currently, the system is under trial on more than 5,650 Netflix users and based on its success rate, it will be rolled out onto the entire user base by March this year.” Synamedia, the largest independent video software provider, offered its Credentials Sharing Insight product, which was designed to help streaming service providers combat the rapid rise in account sharing between friends and families and turn it into a new revenue-generating opportunity. The product was thought to have the ability to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate password sharing. According to the January 9, 2019 article, Synamedia’s product was “capable of viewing habits and location habits of a user to identify when non-paying viewers log into an account. It can detect whether a user is ‘viewing at their main home’ or a ‘holiday home.’ It could also detect if a subscriber has ‘grown-up children who live away from home’ so streaming services won’t punish the wrong people for account sharing.” While Netflix did not publicly acknowledge that it was using Synamedia’s product, Netflix management did admit to monitoring account sharing. On the Company’s October 16, 2019 Q3’19 earnings call, an analyst asked whether “a more mature growth trajectory in the U.S.” makes it “important for [Netflix] to address” password sharing. Peters replied “we continue to monitor it, so we’re looking at the situation. We’ll see, again, those consumer-friendly ways to push on the edges of that. But I think we’ve got no big plans to announce at this point in time in terms of doing something differently there.” Prior to the end of the Class Period, Netflix did not publicly disclose the extent of account sharing, and analysts’ estimates of account sharing varied significantly. A July 2019 research note by MoffettNathanson indicated that “about 14% of Netflix users report they are using a password from ‘someone outside of my household.’” On June 8, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This securities fraud class action arises from Defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions about Lucid’s production of the Company’s only commercially-available electric vehicle (“EV”), the Lucid Air (the “Air”), and the factors impacting that production. At all times, Defendants concealed the severe, internal, Company-specific problems that were actually slowing production, including internal logistics issues, design flaws, and the key drivers of parts shortages. Instead, Defendants blamed Lucid’s woes on the purported impact of external, industry-wide supply chain problems and repeatedly assured investors that the Company was “mitigating” that global impact. These misrepresentations left investors with a materially false and misleading impression about Lucid’s actual production and internal ability and readiness to mass produce its vehicles. Against that backdrop, Defendants then lied, time and again, about the number of vehicles Lucid would produce. When the relevant truth about Lucid’s disastrous internal logistics and production issues was finally revealed to the market over two partial corrective disclosures, Lucid’s common stock price cratered, causing substantial damage to the Company’s investors. Defendant Lucid designs, produces, and sells luxury EVs. The Company evolved from a startup called Atieva, Inc. (“Atieva”), which initially produced and sold EV batteries and electric powertrains to EV companies. In 2013, Atieva decided to shift its business model and produce its own EVs. To spearhead the transformation, Atieva hired industry-veteran Peter Rawlinson (“Rawlinson”), who had overseen the development of Tesla, Inc.’s (“Tesla”) Model S from 2009 to 2012. Atieva changed its name to Lucid in 2016. That same year, the Company unveiled a prototype of its first vehicle—a luxury EV sedan it dubbed the Lucid Air. It also announced plans to build a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and said it would begin producing the Air by 2018. Since it was unveiled, the Air’s design has garnered high praise. Market commentators called it “a technological breakthrough” and heralded it as one of “the most compelling automotive launches in recent years.” But as one commentator noted, “a prototype, no matter how lovely, does not make a[n] automaker,” and “there’s quite a gulf between designing a great car and producing and selling that car.” Ultimately, Lucid’s success hinged entirely on its ability to ramp up commercial production of the Lucid Air. That is because the Air was essentially Lucid’s only source of potential revenue, and the Company could not recognize significant revenue from sales of the Air until it was able to mass produce vehicles and deliver them to paying customers. The speed at which Lucid ramped production was also critical, for at least three reasons. First, although the Company boasted a substantial book of preorders for the Air, it had to get vehicles to customers before they got tired of waiting and cancelled their refundable orders. Second, while the EV market still had relatively few players, it was imperative for Lucid to quickly get production off the ground and grab market share before additional competitors entered the market. Third, the Company was burning through billions of dollars in cash getting production off the ground, and the longer it took to start bringing in substantial revenues from the Air, the greater the chances that it would run out of funds. Simply put, Lucid’s ability to quickly ramp production would determine the Company’s future. And in that realm, as commentators noted, Lucid “remain[ed] entirely unproven.” In the years that followed the Company’s unveiling of the Lucid Air prototype, Lucid struggled to raise much-needed cash as a private company, leading it to repeatedly delay the start of production. In 2018, desperate for capital, Lucid inked a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), to provide $1 billion in funds in exchange for the majority interest in the Company. Despite this infusion, by the beginning of 2021, Lucid still had not commenced commercial production of the Air and was again running low on cash. As a result, Lucid decided to seek funding from a new source—investors on the public market. On February 22, 2021, Lucid announced plans to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV (“Churchill”) in order to bring the Company public through a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) transaction (the “Merger”). At the time, the Merger was the largest proposed SPAC transaction in history, and would provide Lucid with $4.4 billion in cash. Rawlinson was desperate to close the Merger, as he knew that cash was critical to Lucid’s ability to continue growing as a company. Indeed, when the Merger was announced, Lucid disclosed that it was so cash-strapped that it would require $600 million in bridge funding to continue its operations until the Merger closed. Rawlinson was also highly motivated to close the Merger because he knew that, in doing so, he would not only earn a $2 million bonus, but would lock down a lucrative compensation package with a potential value of approximately $556 million. Lucid’s Board of Directors had approved the framework for Rawlinson’s compensation package before the Merger was announced, but made clear that “[s]uccessful merger completion” was necessary “to receive the grant at all.” As the Merger approached, Rawlinson knew that investors were laser-focused on whether Lucid would finally be able to ramp up production of the Air after years of delay. To ensure that the Merger went through and provided Lucid with critical funding, he and the Company took a number of steps to convince investors that it would, in fact, quickly ramp up production of the Air and begin generating substantial revenues. For example, in a February 22, 2021 investor presentation announcing the Merger, Rawlinson and Lucid told investors that the Company would produce 20,000 vehicles by the end of 2022, thus garnering more than $2 billion in 2022 revenues. Rawlinson continued to drive investor interest in Lucid by reiterating its 2022 production guidance in the run-up to the July 2021 Merger, assuring investors in May 2021 and July 2021 that Lucid would produce 20,000 EVs in 2022. Even with the investor interest generated by Defendants’ repeated production promises, on the day the Merger was scheduled to close (July 22, 2021), Defendants had yet to garner the necessary votes from Churchill shareholders. So, that day, Rawlinson implored investors to “please, please vote,” and again reiterated that Lucid was ‘“energized about going into full production mode’ later this year.” A day later, on July 23, 2021, the Merger closed. Lucid’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq on July 26, 2021. By going public through the SPAC Merger, Lucid secured $4.4 billion in additional funding and Rawlinson secured a $2 million bonus and a staggering $556 million in potential stock option compensation. Furthermore, because of the structure of Rawlinson’s stock option package—more than half of his options would only vest if the Company hit certain market capitalization targets within five years of going public—he remained highly motivated to keep Lucid’s common stock price inflated. As Rawlinson admitted, “I’m all in on stock options[,] that’s what motivates and drives me.” Thus, in the months that followed the Merger, Rawlinson continued to try and prop up Lucid’s stock price by assuring investors that Lucid was on track to meet its production targets. On September 28, 2021, Lucid announced that—after multiple delays—it had finally begun production of the Air. Lucid made its first deliveries of the Air to customers on October 30, 2021. The Class Period begins on November 15, 2021—the day that Lucid announced its first quarterly results as a public company. On that day, Defendants told investors that they were “confident in [their] ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022.” As for potential risks to that production, Defendants expressly directed investors only to then-existing “ongoing challenges facing the automotive industry, with global disruptions to supply chains and logistics,” but, in the same breath, assured investors that “[w]e are taking steps to mitigate these challenges.” These statements were blatantly false. In the weeks leading up to November 15, 2021, Rawlinson himself admitted internally that Lucid would miss its production targets. In particular, according to former employee (“FE”)-2, during a meeting in October 2021 or the first week of November 2021, Rawlinson told a small group of Lucid employees that the Company would miss its targets and would produce less than 10,000 vehicles in 2022. Rawlinson further instructed the employees at the meeting to keep the fact that Lucid would miss its 2022 production target confidential. Moreover, multiple former Lucid employees confirm that prior to Defendants’ November 2021 statements, Rawlinson was told that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production targets, and that the fact that Lucid would not meet this target was widely understood and discussed within the Company, including by Lucid’s top executive management. Defendants also knew at all times leading up to and throughout the Class Period that Lucid was suffering from severe and pervasive internal problems unique to Lucid that made it impossible for the Company to mass produce vehicles. Thus, contrary to Defendants’ assurances, the then-existing headwinds Lucid was experiencing were neither transient nor borne by the industry as a whole, but were internal, structural in nature, widespread, and ongoing. Nevertheless, when analysts pressed Defendants for answers concerning the status of Lucid’s production of the Air, they lied. Specifically, Defendants claimed that the main sticking point was whether the Company would be impacted by global supply-chain and logistics challenges impacting the automotive market as a whole, and that Lucid was already taking steps to mitigate these issues. In truth, Defendants knew or were reckless in disregarding that Lucid suffered from severe internal, Lucid-specific issues that were significantly hampering its ability to produce vehicles. To start, Lucid’s inventory management systems were entirely ineffective and inoperable. This meant that the Company’s employees and other workers in Lucid’s Warehouse (defined below) lacked even the most basic information necessary to run the Warehouse, including that they had little or no information about how many parts the Company actually had at any given time, or even where parts were, and thus could not locate them when the production line requested them. This, in turn, negatively impacted Lucid’s ability to efficiently reorder parts because it was unable to tell when inventory was low on or when it had run out of a particular part. This chaos was compounded by the fact that Lucid’s Warehouse was operating significantly above capacity, which not only made it difficult to locate parts in piles stacked up to the ceiling, but also resulted in tens of millions of dollars in parts being smashed and destroyed. As a result of these and other significant internal logistics issues, the Company was unable to get parts from its Warehouse to its production line in a timely manner, which resulted in frequent production shutdowns. Indeed, former Lucid employees described the Warehouse as “a complete mess” and “utter chaos,” and confirmed that the vast majority of the Company’s production delays resulted from its failing internal logistics systems. These severe internal logistics issues were plaguing Lucid by no later than the summer of 2021, and persisted until at least the summer of 2022. Even when Lucid’s production was slowed by actual parts shortages—as opposed to an inability to find the parts or get them to the production line—former employees confirmed that many such shortages were problems of Lucid’s own making. This was because the design of the Lucid Air was not sufficiently developed before production was launched and certain parts were not designed for manufacturability. That meant that suppliers were not able to produce parts to meet Lucid’s specifications, causing Lucid to rush to make multiple design changes even after production of the Air had already commenced, or labor to build vehicles with out of spec parts. This, in turn, led to production delays. These facts were well-known by Defendants from day one of the Class Period. Prior to November 2021, Rawlinson and his top lieutenants were directly told about the severe issues in the Warehouse, and the negative impact that they were having on Lucid’s ability to produce vehicles. In addition, Rawlinson knew, based on discussions at internal meetings, that the Air’s design was not where it needed to be before Lucid launched production, which caused parts shortages and last minute design changes. Still, beginning on November 15, 2021, Defendants concealed all of these internal issues that were already having a severe and negative impact on Lucid’s production, and instead told investors that the main risk to the Company’s targets was industry-wide supply chain issues, and that they were already mitigating those risks. This gave investors the false and misleading impression that internally Lucid was ready and able to quickly ramp up production, when in truth it was anything but. Analysts and the financial media reacted positively to Defendants’ assurances. For example, the following day, CNBC reported that “[Lucid’s] market capitalization surpassed that of Ford Motor on Tuesday as investors reacted to management confirming production plans for 2022[.]” Bloomberg similarly wrote that Lucid shares “closed up 24% in New York, bringing its value to over $91 billion. . . . The surge in the shares came after Lucid said Monday it remained confident in its ability to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022.” Defendants proceeded to then take full advantage of Lucid’s artificially inflated stock price. First, on December 8, 2021, Lucid announced a public offering of convertible senior notes. As market commentators noted, by using “[o]pportunistic timing” and “[t]aking advantage of a strong stock price,” Lucid was able to raise over $2 billion in gross proceeds to fund its business. Second, by January 25, 2022, Rawlinson had maintained Lucid’s high market capitalization for long enough to trigger four out of the five tranches of his performance-based stock options. As a result, Rawlinson received nearly 14 million Lucid stock options that were valued at approximately $263 million as of April 28, 2022. Despite having known for months that Lucid would produce less than 10,000 units in 2022, even in mid-February 2022, Defendants still falsely assured investors that Lucid would produce 20,000 cars by year-end. Just two weeks later, however, on Lucid’s February 28, 2022 earnings call, Defendants did an abrupt about-face, admitting that Lucid would miss its 20,000 vehicle target by up to 40%, and slashing the Company’s 2022 production guidance to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On this news, Lucid’s stock price fell more than 13%, from a close of $28.98 per share on February 28, 2022, to a close at $24.99 per share on March 1, 2022. Market commentators likewise reacted negatively, calling Lucid’s “massive” guidance cut “particularly disappointing,” a “clear disappointment,” “jarring,” and a “[f]all from grace,” and noting that it “sen[t] shares . . . tumbling” and “plunged Lucid into an uphill battle to regain investor trust.” They further noted that “[t]he biggest threat to Lucid is that it misses on its already lower guidance and further slashes guidance in the coming quarters.” Defendants, of course, knew that Lucid would miss even its reduced guidance figures as a result of the severe internal issues it was facing. Lucid’s internal logistics issues had not improved but, rather, as Rawlinson knew, were only getting worse. As a result, Defendants’ statements on February 28, 2022, were materially false or misleading, and Lucid’s stock price remained artificially inflated. Lucid’s stock price also remained artificially inflated because Defendants continued to conceal the severe internal logistics problems that Lucid was experiencing, and instead misleadingly pinned the blame again on global supply chain and logistics problems that were impacting the automotive industry as a whole. For example, during the February 28, 2022 call, Defendants repeatedly blamed “ongoing, industrywide challenges in logistics and supply chains,” “supply chain challenges” felt by “many manufacturers,” and “supply chain challenges that you’ve heard about in numerous companies across industries this earnings season.” As a result, investors were left with the false and misleading impression that Lucid was primed and ready to mass produce its vehicles, but was being constrained by industry-wide factors. Analysts again credited Defendants’ explanation, reporting that Lucid’s guidance reduction was the result of “supply chain problems,” ‘“extraordinary’ supply-chain pressures,” and “supply chain constraints,” and noting that Lucid “is getting absolutely crushed by short-term challenges such as higher component costs, supply chain issues, and higher shipping costs.” For the remainder of the Class Period, Defendants continued to point to those purported global, industry-wide supply chain issues as the main obstacle to Lucid producing vehicles, while concealing the severe internal logistics issues that were hampering its actual production. On the back of these misrepresentations, Defendants falsely reaffirmed Lucid’s production guidance of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles throughout the spring of 2022. For example, during the Company’s May 5, 2022 1Q22 earnings conference call, Defendants again reiterated Lucid’s 12,000 to 14,000 guidance and continued to point to global supply chain issues as the main factor impacting and risk to Lucid’s production, noting that “we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 guidance for the balance of the year, so long as the supply chain logistics disruptions aren’t material and our mitigation plans are effective.” None the wiser, analysts latched onto and repeated Defendants’ statements and false assurances, reporting, for example, that “LCID reiterated its 2022 outlook of 12K-14K units production” and that the Company “does see supply chain disruptions from China as the most likely risk.” Bloomberg similarly reported that Lucid “reaffirmed its plans to make as many as 14,000 plug-in vehicles this year” and that the Company was “work[ing] to overcome supply-chain challenges that are gripping the automotive industry.” Just a few months later, on August 3, 2022, the relevant truth concealed by Defendants’ false and misleading statements and omissions was fully revealed to the market. That day, in reporting Lucid’s 2Q22 results, Defendants finally revealed what they had known all along—that the Company would make less than 10,000 units in 2022, slashing Lucid’s guidance again, this time to 6,000 to 7,000 units. Moreover, although they claimed to have just discovered them, Defendants finally disclosed that Lucid’s inability to ramp production had been caused primarily by severe internal logistics problems unique to Lucid. For example, departing from Lucid’s prior scapegoating of global supply chain issues, Rawlinson explained that recent developments had “exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes,” which he conceded were the “primary"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Cutera is a global provider of laser and other energy-based aesthetic and dermatology solutions for medical practitioners worldwide. Cutera's operations are segregated into two reportable business segments: Core Capital and AviClear. Core Capital includes sales of non-AviClear equipment and related one-time use products necessary to perform treatments with the equipment. One-time products, referred to as consumables, include the sale cycles—the fees for system usage on a treatment-by-treatment basis—and consumable products, the physical materials used for each cycle, such as needle cartridges and sticky pads. Core Capital drives a substantial portion of Cutera's total revenue. In 2022, when Cutera first introduced AviClear, Core Capital accounted for 98% of total revenue. Almost two years after the AviClear rollout, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Core Capital still accounted for over 91% of total revenue. Core Capital also generates revenue from consumables. CW 3 indicated that the company makes more money on the sales of consumables than the devices themselves because the consumables were a constant revenue stream. Consumables were thus an important component of Cutera's business. Not only did consumables provide Cutera with a recurring revenue stream, but consumables were necessary for customers to be able to use the devices and capital equipment that they bought or leased. That is, if Cutera did not have enough consumables to accompany the devices that Cutera sold to customers (as was the case here), then customers would not be able to use the devices and capital equipment. Worse, Cutera would not receive any recurring revenue from consumables, and, on top of that, be faced with angry customers who were left with useless equipment. Having control over its inventory was therefore critical to Cutera's financial performance. During the Class Period, Cutera embarked on an all-hands-on-deck initiative to place its new acne treating device called AviClear into as many customers' offices as possible, no matter the cost. AviClear, as Cutera described, is a laser treatment that offers a prescription-free solution for acne. Cutera began a limited commercial launch of AviClear in April 2022. On April 5, 2022, Cutera issued a press release announcing that the first patient outside of clinical trials was treated with AviClear. And in November 2022, Cutera had its full commercial release of AviClear. Cutera developed a new AviClear leasing model (which differed from Cutera's other businesses), in part, to compete with a similar product called Accure, which was coming to market around the same time as AviClear. CW 2 confirmed that Cutera shifted to this lease or subscription model for AviClear in reaction to Accure, which the company knew would soon be entering the market. CW 2 indicated that Cutera wanted to get AviClear into the market as quickly as possible, and into as many customers' offices, to preempt that competition. This rush to beat competition, however, caused AviClear device failures due to Cutera likely not testing the equipment as much as it should have, as described further below. Evidencing the importance Cutera placed on selling AviClear, Cutera not only assembled an AviClear-exclusive sales team (i.e., TSRs), but Cutera also permitted capital equipment representatives to sell AviClear devices. In fact, they were not just permitted to do so, they were directed to do so by Defendants. Federal law requires that the CEO and CFO of public companies, such as Cutera, certify their company's quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and the procedures established by those companies to prepare the financial statements and disclosures. Section 302 of SOX—designed to ensure that a public company's CEO and CFO take a proactive role in their company's public disclosures and to instill investors with confidence concerning the accuracy, quality, and reliability of a company's periodic SEC reports—requires that a CEO and CFO of a public company address the following topics in annual SEC filings (i.e., a Form 10-K for Cutera): (i) the material accuracy and fair presentation of the report's disclosures; (ii) establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures; and (iii) any material changes to the company's internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, the CEO and CFO must certify that: (i) they have reviewed the periodic report; (ii) it does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make any statements made not misleading; (iii) based on their knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information fairly present the financial condition and operations of the company; (iv) they have maintained disclosure controls and internal controls and have designed such controls to ensure that all material information is made known to them and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information; and (v) they have disclosed to the audit committee and auditors all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls. These certifications communicate to investors that all material information required to be disclosed is contained in the report. Section 404 of SOX requires management of public companies such as Cutera to establish and maintain a system of internal controls relating to, among other things, financial reporting. Section 404 further requires management to document, test, and maintain those controls and procedures to ensure their effectiveness, as well as to assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis. Ultimately, Section 404 requires that management of a public company annually evaluates the effectiveness of the company's ICFR and discloses the conclusion, including any material weaknesses, to investors. Section 404 of SOX was intended to bring information about material weaknesses in internal controls into public view. Under Item 308 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR § 229.308(a)(3), Management is not permitted to conclude that the registrant's internal control over financial reporting is effective if there are one or more material weaknesses in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness, as defined within Cutera's Forms 10-K, is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of SOX requires management of public companies to select an internal control framework and then assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of those internal controls on an annual basis. According to the Company's filings, Cutera adopted the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control Framework. The COSO Framework states: Internal control is a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (ii) reliability of financial reporting; and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. COSO identifies five interrelated components of internal control: (i) control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring activities. COSO requires that: Each of the five components of internal control and relevant principles is present and functioning [and that] [t]he five components are operating together in an integrated manner. COSO also identifies that these components are relevant to an entire entity and to the entity level, its subsidiaries, divisions, or any of its individual operating units or functions. A restatement is the process of revising previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error in those financial statements. When an error is identified that is material to previously issued financial statements, an entity is required to restate and reissue those financial statements. Under the above federal laws, Defendants were required to implement internal controls over Cutera's financial reporting, to certify the accuracy of such reporting and that no material weaknesses exist, and to issue a restatement for quarters where material errors in the financial reporting exist. As explained herein, Defendants failed to implement adequate internal controls for several quarters, as evidenced by Cutera restating its financials for the first and second quarters of 2023. Notwithstanding the above-referenced requirements, throughout the Class Period, Defendants concealed from investors a number of severe problems that contributed to Cutera's dramatic nosedive, including: (i) a lack of control over inventory and internal controls weaknesses; (ii) widespread supply chain problems leading to order fulfillment problems and parts availability backlogs; (iii) rampant quality control and reliability problems, equipment breakdowns, and unmet demands for equipment repairs and service; and (iv) managements' failure to effectively execute the AviClear rollout, including over-indexing resources to place AviClear devices at the expense of Cutera's core business. Since the beginning of the Class Period, Cutera had no control over its ITGC or inventory controls, which worsened when Cutera tried to implement a formal ERP system during the Class Period. Generally speaking, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system helps a company manage each of its business operations from a single platform, which includes managing all aspects of the company's inventory in real time, including costs, orders, products and materials in stock, and supplier information. All companies that deal with sales and inventory would therefore be expected to employ a robust ERP system. Moreover, Cutera's version of Salesforce, a system designed to track Cutera's labor, travel time, and parts used on service calls was also obsolete and ineffective. Indeed, CW 6 indicated that while the company had an inventory system prior to the implementation of SAP and Salesforce in 2022, it was not a formal system, which she described as a very generic inventory system. Cutera announced on February 22, 2022 that it would ramp-up investment in a long-awaited ERP system throughout the year to enable long-term scalability of the Company's operations, and finally took its new system live in the first quarter of 2022. This upgrade to a new ERP system exacerbated the problems plaguing Cutera's information technology infrastructure related to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and inventory count controls. Indeed, at least since the beginning of the Class Period, Cutera had extensive problems managing and controlling its inventory and maintaining adequate internal controls of its financial reporting and overseeing its operations. As investors later learned, the Company-wide weaknesses in ITGC went hand-in-hand with internal weaknesses in Cutera's inventory controls, which were exacerbated by the botched rollout of the ERP/SAP system. As Defendants admitted in April 2023, the material weaknesses over inventory controls related to the completeness, existence, and cut-off of inventories held at third parties, inventories held by sales personnel, and inventories in transit, and controls related to the calculation of adjustments to inventory for items considered excessive and obsolete. Multiple CWs recalled that since the start of the Class Period, Cutera had problems controlling and overseeing its inventory, supply chain, and internal controls. For example, CW 8 recalled that Cutera never had a formal ERP system prior to the system implemented in January 2022. CW 8 indicated that the Field Service team used Salesforce to track its labor, travel time, and parts used on service calls. CW 8 added that the older version was not meeting certain compliance requirements, so the company upgraded. She commented, however, that Cutera invested just enough money in the systems to make them work, but not enough to make them work effectively. Likewise, CW 6 recalled that Cutera had problems implementing the new Salesforce and SAP systems. She added that the company went cheap, and the implementation went catastrophically downhill as a result. CW 8 explained that the change to the new SAP system began in January 2022, and the change over to the new Salesforce system began in approximately February 2022. CW 8 indicated that the process to identify which parts were used or needed was not clearly defined in the system. As a result, she explained, parts would be used by the engineers but would still appear in the system as available. In other words, she added, the system would show that a particular part was available in the warehouse, when it was not. To make matters worse, Cutera employees were not formally trained on the new ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems until months after their implementation—meaning that even if the systems had worked properly (which they did not), the systems would still be ineffective since the workers were not trained on them. For example, CW 8 explained that there were two to three months of using these new systems without any formal training. CW 8 emphasized that even two to three months after implementation, during the training, the system was still not working correctly; it continued to not work correctly for a long time after. CW 8 commented that it was a mess. Nor was there any oversight of these new systems when they were first implemented, which contravenes Defendants' obligations to monitor its inventory controls. Indeed, CW 8 commented that it was almost like there was no oversight for the first few months with the new systems. CW 8 also recalled that there was no process in place for management to review open work orders or to monitor whether work was completed. She noted that some work orders which were completed remained open in the system, because there was no process for entering that completed work order in the system, to show that it had been done, and to enter the parts and labor used in the work order properly. With no training on and no oversight of the ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems—systems whose primary responsibility was to manage the Company's inventory—problems with tracking inventory naturally occurred. One such problem was that the amount of inventory that the systems displayed never matched the actual physical inventory at Cutera's facility. Consequently, such a mismatch would necessarily lead to the inaccurate accounting of such inventory (and related financial metrics) on Cutera's financial statements—as Defendants later admitted was the case for several quarters during the Class Period. For instance, regarding the problem of the SAP system showing parts on hand in the warehouse when those parts in reality were unavailable, CW 8 explained that those problems started in approximately the second or third quarters of 2022. She also noted that there were loads of back-order parts in the system, and that logging the consumption of parts by the FSEs in the system was cumbersome, which contributed to the inventory counts being off. Critically, CW 8 recalled the problem of discrepancies between parts listed in the system with parts available in the warehouse was raised in meetings. She noted that the FSEs carried inventory, referred to as trunk stock, with them for their work orders. Indeed, she added that the FSEs were required periodically to conduct an inventory count of their trunk stock and report the results to accounting, and that these counts were done at least annually, sometimes more frequently, and that there were occasional one-off or spot checks of trunk stock inventory. CW 8 understood that Defendant Seth and Thier saw that information. In addition to the botched rollout of the ERP/SAP and Salesforce systems, Defendants also failed to establish any meaningful controls over the physical inventory stored in the Company's warehouse. For example, CW 6 explained that she had visited the warehouse facility in the company's headquarters, which is where the inventory was stored and where the company's main offices were also located. She recalled that while employees needed a key to enter the building itself, all Cutera employees had access to the building. Once inside, she added, there were no access controls for the warehouse section itself. Specifically, CW 6 explained that there were no designated rooms within the building to keep inventory securely; instead, inventory was everywhere, including in the hallways. She described how anyone could walk in, put parts in their pocket, and simply walk out without getting caught. Furthermore, CW 6 explained that Cutera's management—specifically Pinapati—knew that anyone could walk into the warehouse area and take parts, as management's offices were in the same building. CW 6 added that management's offices, including Mowry's, were on the first floor of the building, the same floor as the inventory, but then management's offices eventually moved to the second floor of the building. CW 6 indicated that Pinapati had been told several times about the inventory problems. CW 6 recalled that the FSEs raised their concerns about availability of parts to their managers and field directors, who in turn raised the concerns to Pinapati, who ran the Field Service group. She also recalled a conference call meeting with Pinapati and all the FSEs in June or July 2022 to discuss these problems. During that call, CW 6 recalled, Pinapati told the FSEs that everything would be fixed, and inventory processes brought under control within 30 days, and that it was his top priority. She added that, despite Pinapati's assurances, nothing changed. Furthermore, it was CW 6's understanding that Pinapati was part of regular meetings with Mowry and other Vice Presidents all the time, as she noted there were frequent meetings of company management at its Brisbane headquarters. Cutera's senior executives, especially Mowry, therefore knew about the lack of control over inventory which ultimately caused the Company's internal controls to fail, or at the very least were reckless in not knowing about such problems considering, among other things, that they were explicitly told about inventory problems and worked in the very same building in which any Cutera employee could walk in and remove inventory. Yet Defendants did nothing to maintain adequate internal controls. The problems with Cutera's ERP/SAP system and Defendants' lack of control over inventory created supply chain constraints and severely impacted Cutera's ability to fulfill customer orders, and thus harmed Cutera's business. In fact, as explained further below, these inventory problems ultimately resulted in an extended plant shutdown. For example, CW 5 noted that, at one point in late 2022 or early 2023, the company stopped shipping everything to customers, including consumables. Similarly, CW 1 recalled that Cutera had been struggling with supply chain and inventory problems throughout 2023. She explained that the source of the problem was Pinapati, whom CW 1 described as asleep at the wheel. She added that there was also excess inventory on devices that Cutera barely sold, but minimal or lack of inventory for the company's top three sellers, including AviClear. CW 1 added that Mowry knew about these problems, but he appeared to protect Pinapati and refused to take action. She also recalled that Mowry knew about the inventory problems because Batarseh, Eckerman, and Sennet informed her that they told Mowry that Pinapati's inventory estimates were wrong. CW 1 further elaborated that many people raised concerns about supply chain problems, and Pinapati's performance, to Mowry. She elaborated that concerns were raised to Mowry by Huffman, Batarseh, Eckerman, Thier, Karavitis, and Sennett. Indeed, CW 1 indicated that she raised the same concerns to Mowry herself, and that these problems were discussed all throughout 2023. She added that when Defendant Hopkins became Interim-CEO, she also refused to take steps to correct the supply chain problems and even gave Pinapati a retainer bonus to stay with Cutera. Notably, as a result of Cutera's complete lack of internal controls over inventory and the supply chain (problems of which were worsened as a result of the AviClear rollout), Defendants filed several quarters of financial statements that contained materially false and misleading financial figures related to cost of revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating loss, and inventory—which the Company admitted constituted material errors by the need to file a Restatement. Indeed, on March 5, 2024, Cutera confirmed there was a shortfall of inventory relative to the Company's system of record.

      "summary": "Rain Oncology, a clinical-stage precision oncology company, went public in April 2021. Rain’s lead product candidate was milademetan, a small molecule oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (“MDM2”) that had the potential to treat certain cancers. Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), a Japanese company, developed milademetan and conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States between July 2013 and October 2020. The trial was a first-in-human study, meaning that it was the first time milademetan was administered to humans. One of the trial’s primary objectives was to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for milademetan. The trial ultimately identified a recommended dose of 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days. This result was based on data from 16 study participants with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (“DD LPS”), which represented 15% of the trial’s overall population. On September 2, 2020, Rain acquired a license to develop and commercialize milademetan from Daiichi Sankyo. Rain’s prospectus for its initial public offering described the licensing agreement and the Phase 1 trial data. The prospectus stated that Rain had obtained a worldwide license to develop and commercialize milademetan and that the Phase 1 trial had demonstrated that milademetan’s median progression-free survival (“mPFS”) was approximately three to four times greater than the current standards of care. The prospectus also stated that Rain anticipated commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2021 based on the Phase 1 trial data. Rain’s initial public offering raised $121.9 million in net proceeds. Rain commenced its Phase 3 trial for milademetan on July 20, 2021. The trial was referred to as the “MANTRA trial.” Rain’s quarterly report for the second quarter of 2021, which was filed on August 10, 2021, stated that Rain was a late-stage precision oncology company and that the Phase 1 trial data had supported the decision to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. Rain’s quarterly report for the third quarter of 2021, which was filed on November 10, 2021, also referred to Rain as a late-stage precision oncology company and stated that the Phase 1 trial data had supported the decision to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. Rain’s annual report for fiscal 2021, which was filed on March 3, 2022, similarly referred to Rain as a late-stage precision oncology company and stated that the Phase 1 trial data had supported the decision to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. The annual report also stated that the Phase 1 trial data had validated the dosing schedule being used in the Phase 3 trial.

Rain’s quarterly report for the first quarter of 2023, which was filed on May 11, 2023, referred to Rain as a late-stage precision oncology company and stated that the Phase 1 trial data had supported the decision to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. The report also included a diagram that indicated that Rain had conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for milademetan. On May 22, 2023, Rain announced topline results for the MANTRA trial. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Analysts from several top-tier investment banks downgraded Rain in response to the news. In their reports, the analysts noted the risks of proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial from Phase 1 and the high level of Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events, which suggested that the dosing schedule had not been properly optimized during the Phase 1 trial. Rain abandoned its clinical trial plan for milademetan after the MANTRA trial failed. On May 22, 2023, Rain confirmed that it was no longer pursuing any line of therapy involving milademetan for the treatment of DD LPS. In the span of one day, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023, to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023.

In the span of one day, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023, to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023. On May 30, 2023, Rain announced plans to suspend further development of milademetan, including suspension of enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2 MANTRA-2 basket trial and the termination of plans for its Phase 1/2 MANTRA-4 combination trial, as well as a reduction in headcount of approximately 65%, and a plan to evaluate alternatives to enhance its pipeline through precision oncology program acquisitions or other transactions. On August 10, 2023, Rain reported its financial earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Rain announced it had decided to discontinue the entire development program for milademetan, including its other ongoing MANTRA studies. Rain also announced it had decided to focus on “cost-saving measures, including a reduction in force,” and was actively looking for new opportunities to license or acquire clinical-stage programs and technologies. On October 17, 2023, Rain entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Pathos AI, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing artificial intelligence-powered pathology tools. The purpose of the agreement was to allow both companies to share information with one another to negotiate a merger or acquisition. On November 16, 2023, Rain and Pathos AI executed a proposal whereby Pathos AI would acquire Rain through a tender offer. On December 13, 2023, Rain announced the acquisition by Pathos AI. According to the announcement, Pathos AI will acquire Rain for $1.16 per share plus contingent value rights equaling approximately $0.17 per share based on the deal closing and milademetan’s first patient dosing within five years. Rain shareholders presently have until January 25, 2024 to tender their shares under the terms of the acquisition agreement.",

      "summary": "Fastly, Inc. is a cloud computing services provider that operates an edge cloud platform, which enables developers to build, secure, and deliver digital experiences. The majority of Fastly’s revenue is driven by usage of its platform by its existing enterprise customers. Fastly’s ten largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenue. Thus, changes in usage by these customers can create volatility in Fastly’s revenue. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made materially false or misleading statements regarding macro impacts on the Company’s business and the growth of the Company’s existing customers. Plaintiffs allege that these statements artificially inflated the price of Fastly’s stock, and that Plaintiffs and other Class members suffered significant losses and damages when the price of Fastly’s stock declined after the truth was revealed. Plaintiffs bring two causes of action: (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. The Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss, holding that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead scienter as to the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims. Because Section 20(a) claims are derivative of Section 10(b) claims, the Court also dismissed the Section 20(a) claims. The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.

      "summary": "Plaintiffs are short sellers of Defendant Vicor’s common stock. Vicor designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and complete power systems that deliver and/or manage electrical power for deployment in, among other areas, high-performance computing, industrial equipment and automation, robotics, unmanned and manned vehicles, and satellites. Plaintiff brings this action against Vicor and its CEO, Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli, for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Vicor’s two largest customers had been Google and Nvidia. One of Vicor’s significant feats early on was having its power-management components featured as part of Nvidia’s Artificial Intelligence chips—Nvidia’s Flagship Datacenter AI GPUs—and in Google’s 48V server infrastructure. When Nvidia’s new AI chips emerged in 2022 but did not feature Vicor’s power designs or components, Vicor’s shares slid over 20%, starting on March 23, 2022, with the trend continuing thereafter. By early 2023, many market commentators who follow the industry, and those who follow Vicor specifically, were questioning the continued reliability of the relationship between Vicor and Nvidia or Google. Through July 2023, according to its public SEC filings, Vicor repeatedly failed to achieve expected milestones, its order backlog shrunk with new orders not replacing the older ones as they were delivered, and revenue declined. For example, on February 22, 2024, Vicor reported in a press release that revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $92.7 million, a 12.2% decrease from $105.5 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and a 14.1% sequential decrease from $107.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 and that backlog for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $160.8 million, a 47.2% decrease from $304.4 million for the corresponding period a year ago, and 8.0% sequential decrease from $174.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Vicor further reported $4.5 million fewer accounts receivable for that period in this same filing. These reflected a continuing trend in Vicor’s performance that was cemented by the fact that it had lost its relationship with Nvidia and Google. Thus, to the common investor, Vicor’s stock appeared significantly overvalued given the business’s condition. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated looked at Vicor’s downward trend as a core thesis for shorting Vicor’s stock. Each Plaintiff—and those similarly situated—took several short positions over the course of approximately twelve weeks starting on or around May 1, 2023. Shortly before trading closed on July 25, 2023, Vicor released its Q2 earnings report. Its companion press release on that day concluded with the first bit of real good news in a while: Commenting on second quarter performance, Chief Executive Officer Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q2 bookings remained weak, ahead of production release of an AI platform with a Lateral Power Distribution Network (‘PDN’) using a 4G ChiP-set, now expected to ramp in Q4. The same 4G ChiP-set will support a more adept Lateral-Vertical PDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy workloads and superior processor performance.” The message was plain: newly booked sales of the Lateral Power Distribution Network (itself a new product) would reverse the lengthy trend of “weak” sales. During Vicor’s 2023 Q2 earnings call after the market closed that same day, July 25, 2023, the analysts’ questions reflected that they received the same message: Good news—a customer had been confirmed for the new product. The only question the analysts wanted an answer to was how big of a customer. For example, Quinn Bolton, an analyst from Needham & Company who follows Vicor, asked Vinciarelli about how large a difference in sales this customer was likely to represent in the fourth quarter: Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. First question is, can you guys share any more details on the 4G lateral power distribution design that you mentioned in the press release for a new AI platform that ramps in the fourth quarter. Can you say, is this a new customer? Have you worked with this customer previously? Can you give us any sense of what our consumption is for this part? Is it a high power card? Is it a mid-range power card? Any details you can share would be very helpful. Patrizio Vinciarelli: It’s an existing customer. It’s a new generation for the existing customer. And it’s a chipset that can be deployed either in a lateral PDN, which is substantially handicapped from a power system perspective to the point that it limits power delivery, power capability, process of performance, in that it gives rise to large losses within the copper of the substrate to the GPU, that it powers. It gives rise to further losses within the system itself, or into the limitations of lateral power delivery applied at the 1,000 amp level. With a 4G chipset, we can enable a lateral solution with the same handicaps, or with a vertical element using the same chipset, a lateral vertical solution, which is unique, highly differentiated, in that it improves system efficiency by about 10%. And it improves a number of limitations relating to process of performance. The question posed to Vinciarelli indicated that the market was focusing on the news that the new customer agreement would overcome the prior quarters’ weak sales. This was the only real positive news about Vicor in several quarters, and especially during that time frame. On that same call, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, John Dillon, again attempted to confirm the size of the customer with Vinciarelli who confirmed it was a large customer: John Dillon: Okay, great. I want to follow up on Quinn’s question a little bit. . . . Regarding the lateral vertical opportunity that’s coming to production in Q4, is that a high-volume customer is more of a lower volume or more of a modest volume customer [sic]? Patrizio Vinciarelli: So, to be clear, I’ve suggested earlier, the same chip set, which is a 4G chip set, supports both the lateral and the lateral vertical. Based on constant input expectation, as of now, is that the lateral implementation will go first. And that's the one we’re anticipating for the Q4 ramp. I can’t tell you when the lateral vertical was going to production, but my expectation is that it would be after the lateral. John Dillon: Yes, but is this going to be a significant customer or is this more of an incremental volume that you’re going to expect? Patrizio Vinciarelli: This is a significant customer. Throughout the call, Vicor admitted to the poor performance and prospects (namely, the radical decrease in orders in the prior quarters), but Vinciarelli explicitly touted that a “significant” “existing” customer had agreed to make product purchases, the delivery of which was slated to begin in Q4 2023. Vicor’s management—Vinciarelli included—gave specific details regarding the customer as if they were real, e.g., that the customer would use the lateral PDN implementation first and the lateral-vertical PDN implementation later. Management of Vicor gave additional, specific details that the customer would have power delivery “applied at the 1,000 amp level.” Management reiterated that this concerned an “existing” and “significant” Vicor customer seeking the “new generation” part. These details gave the unmistakable impression that a concrete deal had been reached for an existing—not speculative—large customer of a significant number of purchases in the fourth quarter, which would have reversed Vicor’s trend of declining and weak sales. Consistent with the messaging, the market took this information to suggest that Vicor had a new partnership deal with Nvidia or Google. The market’s reaction to this news was immediate and pronounced: whereas Vicor’s stock had closed on July 25, 2023, at $59 before the above earnings announcements, it then opened the next morning on July 26, 2023, at $77.40 and closed at the end of the day at $93.70, reaching an intra-day high of over $94. Average trading volume prior to and after July 26, 2023, had been consistent at around 800,000 to 1.2 million shares per day; but on July 26, 2023, volume exceeded 4.5 million shares, roughly five to six times higher than normal. Because of the skyrocketing price, and in reliance on the announcement of a new “significant customer” who was also an “existing customer,” each Plaintiff was forced to cover their short positions at a significant loss—roughly $35 per share on average, in addition to the roughly $15 per share they would have realized had they not needed to purchase cover. Plaintiffs were forced to cover their short positions in reliance on the news and the market’s overnight internalization of the news. On October 24, 2023, Vicor held its third quarter earnings call. On the call, Vicor failed to mention the customer discussed on the July 25, 2023 call. The analysts’ questions again confirmed what everyone had taken away from the July 25, 2023 call: Vicor had a confirmed big customer. In response, Vicor prevaricated. Vicor did not disclose that its supposed “existing” and “significant” customer had backed out or changed its mind; instead, Vicor denied that it ever said it had such a customer: [Analyst] Quinn Bolton: Last quarter you guys seemed pretty excited about this new AI platform that you expected to ramp in the fourth quarter of 2023 and throughout 2024. Can you just give us any updates on that program? How are you feeling about it, is it still on track? Have you started to see more bookings associated for that? [Vicor Sr. VP of Sales] Philip D. “Phil” Davies: So, Quinn, this is Phil. So, the first part of your question, I think, was what we talked about the last call. And my prepared remarks, I basically said that the first area of focus was to ramp in Q4, our 48-volt bus converters, and factorized power solutions. I hope that answers that question pretty clearly. . . . As I said, we’re having substantial conversations now with customers that will diversify us away from the two big guys that we’ve been doing business with, for the next -- for the last few years. So, as I said, I’m very confident in the future and where we stand and it’s a bit of a complex landscape. In his attempt to retreat from the prior call’s statement that Vicor had already landed a whale of a customer, Phil Davies, a senior manager at Vicor, pivoted away entirely and did not even attempt to explain what happened to the customer. John Dillon, the Goldman Sachs analyst, jumped in to reassert what was said on July 25th—and again, Vicor attempted to deny ever having made the representation: John Dillon: So, with the one major customer though, do they have two different designs with you? One for . . . are they working with two . . . the one customer, do they two different GPUs that are going to be used, in one using lateral, the other’s going to be using lateral-vertical? Or is the same GPU that’s initially going to use lateral, then going to lateral-vertical? Patrizio Vinciarelli: John, we’re not going to talk about any one customer. I’m sorry, but bear with us, that’s not a level of specificity we want to get involved with. ….. John Dillon: On the last call, you stated you had a lateral and a lateral-vertical opportunity with a major GPU customer. I was wondering, was that for the same GPU or was it for two separate GPUs? Phil Davies: So what we talked about there was that we have lateral and lateral-vertical solutions for not just one customer. We are bringing that solution forward, and we have customers looking at that, both of those solutions. And certainly, the number of customers looking at lateral deployment is a little bit higher than the number with lateral-vertical, but we have both. Patrizio Vinciarelli: And that’s also the way in which systems have evolved, but make no mistake. The future, and the future is coming next year, is no longer with lateral PDNs. Another analyst, Richard Shannon also reconfirmed that the prior call had evinced an existing customer relationship, which Vicor denied ever having represented: [Analyst] Richard Shannon: Hi, Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Let’s see, a couple of questions. Maybe a follow-up on the topic of bookings here. I think last quarter, you felt fairly confident that the backlogs would improve either in the ending third quarter or fourth quarter. Now, it seems you’re less certain of that. And I think if I understood one of the answers to a prior question, you’re still expecting the design with a major customer to -- that is still active here. So, it seems like a couple of simple explanations for that would be either that design is delayed or your share of the size of the opportunity is more limited than what you initially had thought or potentially there’s other reasons. So, can you help us understand those dynamics relative to your last conference call? Patrizio Vinciarelli: I think I made clear that we really don’t want to go into the level of detail. And to be clear, well, I appreciate the reason for the interest, the curiosity, it’s really got very little to do with Vicor’s opportunity in the medium and long term. And that’s what we’re really focused on. The questions make clear that the market and the analysts all heard the same thing on July 25th, and were now hearing the opposite. Vinciarelli’s pivot that the customer relationship announced on July 25, 2023, “had very little to do with” Vicor’s business “in the medium and long term” is shocking given how gung-ho he had been just three months earlier. Thus, when pressed to update the public statement made on July 25, 2023, that a “significant” and “existing” customer who had agreed to use two different kinds of implementations at the “1,000 amp level” would ramp up in Q4, Vicor essentially denied the existence of any such customer and pivoted to talk about no specific customer, disclosing only that it was “having substantial conversations with customers who will diversify us away from the two big guys we’ve been doing business with.” In other words, in a mere three-month span, Vicor went from representing that one of the “two big guys” was ramping up a new product with Vicor by Q4 2023, to Vicor talking to other customers so as to not rely on business with the “two big guys.” This corrective disclosure made clear to Plaintiffs and the market that the promised Q4 “ramp in” of a “significant customer” was false when made; investors fled. As seen in the above figure, the price for Vicor immediately fell over 20%. Vicor closed at $53.19 on October 24, 2023. Following the after-hours earnings call, Vicor opened the next day at $39.01. Whereas the number of shares trading on the days prior to October 24, 2023, was consistent with the average of around a million, the volume again approached 4.5 million shares on October 25, 2023 (as people exited), and then reverted to the mean days later. After this lawsuit was filed, Vicor issued a press release to further attempt to cover its tracks. In its statement, Vicor seemingly admitted what it had denied on October 24, 2023—that it had said there was a large customer. Vicor’s press release proceeded to explain that its July 25, 2023 announcement was true because it had just “booked” $30 million in “non-cancellable, non-returnable” orders from the customer, and was a “reflect[ion]” of what Vicor “understood to be” the customer’s “allocation for a new program.” The press release confounds more than it explains. The fact that the press release was released a year after the events in question and only because lawsuits had been filed itself is a basis to read the carefully selected verbiage very closely and with extreme skepticism. The details (if they can be called that) should have been disclosed a year before it was made—e.g., between July 25, 2023 and October 24, 2023, or at least as part of the July 25, 2023 call. The fact that they were not is telling. The fact that the July 25, 2023, announcement that Vicor had landed a significant customer for its new product was predicated on nothing more than Vicor’s subjective” understanding of the “customer’s plans—and not its actual purchases of product—is likewise telling. Had Vicor truly “booked” $30 million in sales for its new product in or around July 25, 2023, it naturally would have filed an SEC Form 8-K to announce such a material development. It did not do so. And once Vicor made the oral announcement on July 25, 2023, it should have filed an SEC Form 8-K announcing the “customer’s” decision to reverse the $30 million in supposedly “Non-Cancellable, Non-Returnable orders.” The only reason it would not have done so at that time is because the reversal was not a reversal at all. The fact that no 8-K was filed and Vicor tried to cover up that fact in its July 25 announcement goes to Vicor’s knowledge and scienter of the falsity that there was a confirmed customer for those orders. The September 3, 2024 press release attempts to suggest that the bookings were real and non-cancellable, yet it never says when they were actually made, and publicly available court documents reveal no filing of a lawsuit for breach of a $30 million purchase order or supply agreement. Finally, nowhere did Vicor even attempt to address the real problem—its announcement on the July 2023 call that an existing customer had entered into a new contract for product from Vicor set to start delivering in Q4 2023 had no factual basis.

      "summary": "This is a federal securities class action alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of SunPower Corporation during the period from August 3, 2021 through January 20, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and who suffered damages as a result of the conduct alleged. The action is brought against SunPower, Peter Faricy, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, and Manavendra S. Sial, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. During the Class Period, beginning with the Company’s reporting of its 2Q21 financial results on August 3, 2021, Defendants allegedly falsely asserted (or omitted to state facts necessary to make the statements not misleading), among other things, that the Company’s commercial business was performing well and was currently on track for the Company to meet its financial guidance. In a press release issued that day, Faricy was quoted as stating: “Our solid second quarter results reflect continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses . . . .” and “we remain on track to achieve our 2021 financial outlook and are well positioned to drive growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond.” Also on August 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s financial results and guidance. During the call, Sial also falsely told investors that the heavy commercial or CIS business was performing well, in particular representing that the commercial segment’s margin performance was “significantly better”: “I think the business is significantly better year-on-year, both from a top line perspective as well as a margin point of view. And then more importantly, we expect the CIS business to be profitable in the back half of the year, which you recall is a significant turnaround from the last couple of years.” The next day, on August 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective. On October 5, 2021, Defendants held a conference call to announce that they were exploring “strategic options” for the CIS business segment, indicating that Defendants were considering selling it. Defendants nevertheless continued to tout the ongoing strength of SunPower’s commercial business and affirmed that CIS was indeed “a point of strength” and “very healthy.” On November 3, 2021, Defendants held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s 3Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Faricy falsely described the state of the Company’s operations and balance sheet, stating: “Over the past few years, you’ve been with us through several major restructuring events and strategic changes. I’m pleased to report we have found our footing. With a streamlined company and our healthiest balance sheet in years, we are now going on offense to grow our business across a vast, mostly untapped residential TAM.” On November 4, 2021, Defendants filed a quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. Like the quarterly report for 2Q21, the 3Q21 Form 10-Q falsely purported to warn investors that SunPower might face financial and other risks “if” its products were defective. Each of the above representations concerning: (i) the current status and trajectory of SunPower’s commercial business, including the Company’s margin performance and balance sheet; (ii) the Company currently being on track to meet SunPower’s FY21 financial guidance; and (iii) the risk that SunPower might or could experience defects or other quality issues in its products or product components was materially false and misleading when made because Defendants knew or deliberately disregarded and failed to disclose the following facts: (a) cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems had already developed in nearly all of the Company’s commercial systems; (b) as a result of the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems, SunPower would be required to incur tens of millions in costs to replace those defective third-party components; and (c) in light of (a) and (b) above, SunPower was not on track to achieve its FY21 financial guidance. Throughout the Class Period, the Company’s stock price traded at artificially inflated prices as high as $34.61. Based on Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions, investors expected that the Company’s commercial business was and would continue to be a key driver of revenue and margin growth, and that the Company’s financial results would not be negatively affected by already existing product defects. The artificial inflation of the Company’s stock price was maintained by Defendants’ continued boasting of the strength of the commercial business, as the truth about the cracking or other defects in third-party components in SunPower’s commercial solar systems remained concealed from the investing public. On December 7, 2021, SunPower published to its website the latest edition of its manual for Safety and Installation Instructions for the United States and Canada. The manual contained newly added language concerning cracking in connectors not present in the 2019 or 2020 editions of the United States and Canada manual. The December 7, 2021 manual included the following new warnings: “Do not allow the connectors to come in contact with chemicals such as greases, oils and organic solvents which may cause stress cracking.” “Connectors are factory assembled with intentional gaps between the cable nut and the body of the connector. Do not retighten module connector nuts as this may lead to stress cracking of the connector assembly and will void the warranty.” In addition, the December 7, 2022 manual added new advisories concerning best practices for safely handling connectors, such as: “For connectors, which are accessible to untrained people, it is imperative to use the locking connectors and safety clips, if applicable, in order to defend against untrained personnel disconnecting the modules once they have been installed.” “Avoid exposure of electrical connections to direct sunlight and do not place the connector in a location where water could easily accumulate.” After December 7, 2021, the Company’s stock price continued to trade at artificially inflated prices above $18 per share. Then, on January 20, 2022, SunPower issued a press release preannouncing that it would miss its earnings guidance for 4Q21 and FY21 and expected approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 due to “cracking” problems in products across its commercial business segments: “Through a product quality assessment, the company has identified a cracking issue that developed over time in certain factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment supplied to SunPower. . . . SunPower expects approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 as it pursues recovery of costs from the suppliers.” The release also noted that SunPower, no doubt in response, had hired a new executive to oversee the Company’s supply chain. Following SunPower’s January 20, 2022 preannouncement, financial analysts were quick to report on the scope and timing of the problem. “nearly all” of SunPower’s commercial solar systems were affected, which would cost an estimated $31 million and require replacement throughout 2022. Importantly, analysts reported that Defendants must have learned about the pervasive problem of cracking in third-party components in conducting due diligence pursuant to selling the CIS business segment, if not earlier. In response to the aftermarket January 20, 2022 disclosures, SunPower’s stock price declined from a close of $19.02 on January 20, 2022, to $15.80 on January 21, 2022, a 16.9% drop, on more than 11.4 million shares trading volume as compared to only 2.8 million shares traded on January 20, 2022. Members of the putative class seek to recover their economic losses as a result of the conduct alleged.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This action arises out of the manufacture of defective aircraft engines by Pratt & Whitney, a business segment of RTX. Pratt & Whitney’s commercial engine sales are a critical driver of RTX’s success. For example, in 2022, Pratt & Whitney’s $20.5 billion in revenue accounted for approximately 30% of RTX’s total net sales. Pratt & Whitney is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) that generates the bulk of its profits through commercial aircraft engine sales and aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul (“Aftermarket MRO”) sales and services on its in-service engines. Pratt & Whitney’s most significant product line is the Geared Turbofan (“GTF”) engine family, which RTX hailed as “the architecture of the future” and a “huge driver” of future growth because the engine promised revolutionary gains in fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and noise reduction. After Pratt & Whitney launched the GTF engine into commercial service in 2016, demand for the engine skyrocketed, particularly from Airbus SE (“Airbus”), which used the GTF engines in popular airplane models purchased by operators including, among others, Delta Air Lines (“Delta”), JetBlue Airways (“JetBlue”), and Spirit Airlines (“Spirit”). By the start of the Class Period in February 2021, the GTF had become so popular that RTX had amassed a massive backlog of 10,000 orders for the GTF engine. Despite their purported appeal, RTX initially sold its GTF engines at a $1 million loss because of their expensive design and construction. Since their initial sale was not profitable, RTX generated the cashflow to breakeven and recoup those initial losses through Aftermarket MRO. However, RTX could only charge for these Aftermarket MRO sales and services after the warranties expired on already-installed engines—typically up to five years from the time the aircraft entered flight service. Accordingly, Defendants had a strong incentive to ramp up GTF engine production and get them into commercial service as quickly as possible. Most importantly, RTX needed to keep the GTF engines in flight service so they could exhaust their warranties, which would then allow RTX to generate cash flow from its lucrative Aftermarket MRO services. However, following the GTF engine’s commercial release in 2016, Pratt & Whitney struggled to increase capacity and thus began cutting corners in quality control for its GTF production. This fact was corroborated by several high-ranking former RTX employees (“FEs”), who were interviewed as part of Lead Plaintiffs’ independent investigation and who had first-hand knowledge of Pratt & Whitney’s manufacturing procedures. These FEs confirmed that these defects arose because Pratt & Whitney prioritized speed over safety in getting the GTF engines out the door and onto planes’ wings. Moreover, RTX formalized this incentive through a top-down directive to find cost savings in any way possible with respect to manufacturing. Throughout the GTF engine fleet’s early years of commercial service, numerous manufacturing defects and quality escapes led to concerns from investors and customers alike. For example, leading up to the Class Period, analysts and investors were troubled by a host of defects with the GTF engine fleet that stood to prevent the program from generating the unprecedented growth that RTX had promised. Indeed, these problems became so prevalent that Airbus temporarily stopped taking delivery of new GTF engines from Pratt & Whitney in 2018. As Defendants desperately pushed to get the GTF engines out the door at the expense of manufacturing quality, one specific manufacturing defect—contaminated powder metal—became particularly widespread and entrenched in the GTF fleet. Pratt & Whitney’s Powdered Metal Defect resulted in the Company manufacturing weakened, structurally compromised engine parts that experienced catastrophic cracking. Since the 1960s, Pratt & Whitney has manufactured its engines’ component parts—including the GTF—using powdered metal. This manufacturing process involves creating a powdered metal alloy from raw materials, bonding the powder through compression and heat into a solid metal “forging,” and finally, machining the metal forging to part specification. Contamination is a significant risk when manufacturing parts from powdered metal. When contaminants enter the manufacturing process, they cause the powdered metal to bond improperly, leaving weak spots in the metal part. And when subjected to the extreme temperature and movement variations that occur during typical flight conditions, the compromised metal will crack and rip apart, leading to catastrophic fractures, engine fires and ultimately, the loss of an airplane. Since 1966, Pratt & Whitney has sourced its powdered metal from a company called HMI Metal Powders (“HMI”). Pratt & Whitney acquired HMI in 1975, and HMI is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of RTX, with its powdered metal facility located in Clayville, New York. In 2023, RTX admitted that Pratt & Whitney added “additional capacity” and a new manufacturing “tower”—the multi-story structure used to manufacture the powdered metal from raw materials— at HMI in late 2015 as part of its effort to scale up production of GTF engines and get them to market. Among the panoply of manufacturing defects plaguing the GTF engine production ramp- up, was Pratt & Whitney’s introduction of foreign contaminants into its powdered metal. Consistent with Defendant Hayes’s admission in 2023 that the Company was aware of the Powdered Metal Defect by no later than 2020, numerous former RTX employees recounted how manufacturing quality defects occurred in Pratt & Whitney’s powdered metal manufacturing process from the Company’s frantic effort to push the GTF engine fleet into flight service. Specifically, FE-1 advised that there was a “telcon” or conference call meeting in approximately August 2019 to discuss the powdered metal problems. FE-1 recalled that the person who called the meeting was Sarah Toomey, Chief Engineer. FE-1 recalled that the meeting was led by the Director of the GTF 1100 engine program, for the A321neo / A320neo aircraft. FE-1 indicated that this meeting was specifically about contamination in the powdered metal supplied by Pratt & Whitney’s source, an entity called HMI, based in Clayville, New York. He noted that materials problems – such as contaminated components – are the “worst you can have” because they go to the life of the component, and therefore the life of the engine. FE-1 articulated that the contaminated powdered metal problems were not limited to the GTF series of engines. As an example, he mentioned that the problem also affected the V2500 engines. Moreover, FE-1 confirmed that senior leadership at Pratt & Whitney were aware of the contaminated powdered metals and titanium problems. He indicated specifically that Frank (Francis) Preli, currently Vice President, Propulsion and Materials Technology and Chief Engineer, Materials and Processes Engineering at the Company, and Geoff Hunt, Senior Vice President, Engineering, were aware of the problems. He elaborated that if the Company did not meet the production numbers, or if the Company had to bring in engines earlier than promised for inspection and repairs, then the cost was on Pratt & Whitney. Relatedly, FE-5, who was employed with Pratt & Whitney as a Mechanical Engineer at Pratt & Whitney’s HMI Metal Powders facility in Clayville, New York, recalled that in approximately 2020, foreign objects were occasionally identified in the powder metal as it was forming. Similarly, FE-9 who worked with multiple engines, including the Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine, detailed how colleagues from Pratt & Whitney’s metallurgical testing labs told him that there had been a problem with its powdered metal since approximately 2016 and that the Company was planning a recall because of this problem. Pratt & Whitney applied the same, problematic wait-and-see approach to the Powdered Metal Defect as it did the numerous other manufacturing problems with the GTF engine fleet. However, the nature of the Powdered Metal Defect meant that foreign particles were dispersed and suspended—at random—throughout Pratt & Whitney’s in-service engines parts, and grew into catastrophic fractures with every flight. Nevertheless, Defendants assured investors that the GTF engine fleet would soon mature beyond its early growing pains and reach its promised levels of profitability. In sum, Defendants opted to conceal the pervasive Powdered Metal Defect and keep the contaminated GTF engines in flight in order to capture lucrative Aftermarket MRO profits. It was not long before Defendants’ gamble began to backfire. On March 18, 2020, Vietnam Airlines Flight VN-920 experienced an HPT disk fracture, leading the Pratt & Whitney engine to rip apart and forcing a high-speed aborted takeoff. The aircraft was equipped with a V2500 series engine manufactured by Pratt & Whitney using the same powdered metal manufacturing process and materials as the GTF engine family, at the exact same facility located in Clayville, New York. Pratt & Whitney’s examination of the aircraft purportedly showed that the fractured turbine disk was attributable to “a material anomaly,” or contamination resulting from “deficiencies in the manufacturing process.” As Defendants would later admit, by this point in 2020, RTX knew that the Powdered Metal Defect was a systemic, serious problem afflicting all Pratt & Whitney engines equipped with parts constructed from the faulty, contaminated material. Moreover, by the time of this discovery in 2020, Defendants knew that revealing the pervasive and costly Powdered Metal Defect to investors would have a cataclysmic impact on RTX’s stock price. Immediately after the March 2020 incident, the FAA issued Emergency Airworthiness Directives and Airworthiness Directives requiring Pratt & Whitney to remove all affected HPT disks within the V2500 engine family from service. The FAA’s directives also required Pratt & Whitney to investigate and determine a “root cause” of the flight safety event. As Defendants would later admit, and Pratt & Whitney’s root cause analysis determined, the HPT disks were defective due to contamination of the powdered metal from which they were made. Moreover, Defendants later admitted in 2023 that this defective powdered metal was used to produce HPT disks across Pratt & Whitney’s engines for all six years, “from approximately Q4 2015 into Q3 2021.” Critically, because the HPT disks for both the V2500 and GTF families were manufactured using the same process and using the same contaminated material, Defendants knew that Pratt & Whitney’s use of contaminated powdered metal meant that the same Powdered Metal Defect in the HPT disks of the V2500 was also present in the GTF engine series. The widespread Powdered Metal Defect was enormously problematic for RTX. Indeed, to remedy the Powdered Metal Defect, the Company would be required to take each engine out of service for numerous months prior to the end of its warranty period. Doing so would cost RTX billions of dollars in emergency inspections and repairs, as well as compensation to airlines for prolonged grounding of planes equipped with the GTF engines with the Powdered Metal Defect. Moreover, the public revelation of such a serious and widespread defect in RTX’s prized GTF engine fleet would be disastrous for the Company during a critical period when RTX was faced with increasing competition, growing customer demand for cutting-edge engine technology, and supply shortages. Accordingly, rather than disclose the full extent of the issue, Defendants repeatedly obfuscated and minimized the defect to investors and the FAA throughout the Class Period. Indeed, in service bulletins, inspection reports, and other materials provided to the FAA, airlines, and operators, RTX falsely and misleadingly asserted that the problem was largely contained to only V2500 engines, that the cracking in the HPT disks was not urgent and could be addressed during routine inspections, and, most importantly, that the Powdered Metal Defect did not significantly impact any other engine types—including the GTF. The Class Period begins on February 8, 2021, as Defendants engaged in a series of material misrepresentations and omissions designed to conceal the Powdered Metal Defect’s impact on the prized GTF engine fleet from investors. Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions were specifically crafted to deceive the investing public into believing that RTX’s GTF engine family was airworthy and to downplay any perceived issues with the engines. Unbeknownst to investors, by the start of the Class Period, Defendants had known for at least a year that the pervasive, dangerous, and costly Powdered Metal Defect stood in the way of the GTF engine fleet’s airworthiness and, therefore, profitability. For example, on February 8, 2021, RTX’s annual 10-K report stated that “technical issues have been identified and experienced” with the GTF engine, which the Company described as “usual for new engines and new aerospace technologies.” RTX assured investors that “Pratt & Whitney has addressed these issues through various improvements and modifications.” Regardless of whether RTX intended to include Powdered Metal Defect in the unspecified “technical issues,” Defendants’ statements were highly misleading. Indeed, if RTX intended for this disclosure to encompass the Powdered Metal Defect, it falsely and misleadingly left investors with the understanding that the Powdered Metal Defect had been “addressed . . . through various improvements and modifications,” when the exact opposite was true: as evidenced by Defendants’ 2023 admissions, Pratt & Whitney’s Powdered Metal Defect was still present on engines manufactured from 2015 through 2021, and the defective engine parts were installed on planes that remained in commercial service. Thus, at the time of this disclosure, the Powdered Metal Defect had not been “addressed” with respect to in-service GTF engines. Therefore, Defendants’ statements falsely led investors to believe that any risk posed by the Powdered Metal Defect had been resolved, when in reality, an even greater risk was still very present. Alternatively, if RTX did not intend for the “technical issues” referenced in this disclosure to encompass the Powdered Metal Defect, Defendants kicked off the Class Period by speaking affirmatively on technical issues while failing to disclose a much larger, known technical issue affecting the GTF engine family—the Powdered Metal Defect—that caused critical engine parts to crack and fail. In reality, the significance of the Powdered Metal Defect meant that, if discovered by the public or the FAA, RTX would be required to recall the engines and perform costly safety inspections on them. Therefore, Defendants’ omission of the Powdered Metal Defect from its affirmative statements touting “addressed” “technical issues” that have been “identified and experienced” led investors to believe that no such risk existed, when Defendants knew that it did. Contrary to their representations to investors, behind the scenes, Defendants’ own actions told a far different story. Indeed, the Powdered Metal Defect was so urgent, so pervasive, and so entrenched that, for eighteen months following the March 2020 incident, Defendants desperately tried to find a solution to remove the contaminant from the powdered metal used to manufacture the engines. Indeed, at the time the February 8, 2021 statements were made, Defendants were still actively trying to cure the Powdered Metal Defect from affecting new manufacturing production. In fact, as Defendant Hayes would ultimately be forced to admit at the end of the Class Period in 2023, it was not until the fourth quarter of 2021 that the Company was finally able to produce engines that were free from contamination. Nevertheless, during this time, Defendants made no mention of the existing Powdered Metal Defect affecting active-service GTF engines, nor of RTX’s ongoing effort to prevent the problem from recurring in newly manufactured engines. Meanwhile, the FAA pressed Pratt & Whitney to expand its findings and acknowledge all products affected by the Powdered Metal Defect. With investors in the dark, and after more than fifteen months had passed since the March 2020 Vietnam Airlines Flight incident, Pratt & Whitney finally provided the FAA with an “expanded” non-public root cause analysis on July 29, 2021, identifying the same Powdered Metal Defect in the GTF engine fleet that caused the March 18, 2020 engine failure in Vietnam. Critically, however, because a subsequent September 10, 2021 FAA Airworthiness Directive referencing the expanded root cause report was based on Pratt & Whitney’s own analysis, the directive was ultimately limited to a small subset of the GTF engines in service that were registered in the United States. Specifically, the FAA’s Airworthiness Directive only related to a total of three GTF engines, which allowed RTX to continue to conceal the scope of the impact of the defect on the GTF fleet and minimize any investor concerns about financial ramifications to the Company. While knowing that the Company was concealing a major defect and safety issue, Defendants nonetheless continued to mislead the market about the GTF engine. For example, on November 9, 2021, Defendant Mitchill assured investors that the GTF “engine is performing very, very well” having “flown nearly 11 million hours” with a dispatch reliability rate “well over 99%.” This further lulled investors into falsely believing that the GTF engines were flying safely toward profitability. In reality, Defendants knew that, because of the Powdered Metal Defect, the hours of service were simply a stopgap to squeeze life out of the engines, knowing that they would need to be grounded for costly inspection and removal of their defective parts. Further, by touting a near-perfect dispatch reliability rate—a metric important to RTX’s customers—Defendants gave investors the false impression that the GTF engines were taking off without issue and meeting airline operators’ expectations. Defendants’ statements had their intended effect, as RTX’s stock price reached a Class Period high of $106.02 on April 20, 2022. Unbeknownst to investors, failed takeoffs (a failure to reliably dispatch the aircraft) were a significant result of the Company’s undisclosed Powdered Metal Defect. In tandem, these statements gave investors the false and misleading impression that the GTF engine was “performing very, very well” when, in reality, Defendants knew that the GTF engines were not airworthy because of the Powdered Metal Defect and, therefore, needed to be removed from service. It was not long before yet another near-catastrophic event on a commercial flight occurred as a result of RTX’s undisclosed Powdered Metal Defect. Specifically, on December 24, 2022, a Viva Aerobus flight—this time equipped with a GTF engine—caught fire and aborted takeoff in Mexico. Knowing that this event meant increased scrutiny from investors and the FAA on the Powdered Metal Defect and the GTF engine family, Defendants nevertheless continued to tout its airworthiness and profitability. Most notably, on June 19, 2023, Defendant Eddy spoke at RTX’s Investor Day at the Paris Air Show and continued to downplay the significance of any manufacturing issues and the risks they posed to Pratt & Whitney’s and the GTF program’s profitability. For example, Defendant Eddy falsely claimed that the GTF fleet had “significant life remaining” and noted that “we’ve assumed all of these activities and the related costs in our contract modeling and of course, in our financial guidance.” Unbeknownst to investors, the GTF engine fleet was on the precipice of incurring significant time out of service for inspection and removal of engine parts that Defendants knew to be defective since 2020. By representing that RTX’s financial estimates contained assumptions related to “all of these activities” to fix technical issues, Defendants misled investors to believe that the GTF engine fleet’s success was unblemished. Despite these unequivocal assurances, Defendants revealed the falsity of their statements to investors by disclosing the Powdered Metal Defect shortly thereafter. Approximately one month after Defendants’ statements at the Paris Airshow, on July 25, 2023, Defendants shocked investors when RTX issued an 8-K Press Release disclosing a “rare condition” in its powdered metal"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Focus Financial Partners Inc. was a Delaware corporation that operated in the RIA space, with ownership interests in more than 85 independent wealth management firms that provide investment and financial services to high and ultra-high net worth individuals and families. Focus was founded in 2004 by Defendants Adolf, Kodialam and Chang. It went public through an initial public offering completed in 2018. Thereafter, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock traded publicly on the NASDAQ market until the August 2023 closing of the Merger. Upon the closing of the Merger, public shareholders were cashed out and Focus became a privately held company whose shares are predominantly owned by CD&R. Stone Point was the Company’s largest shareholder and controlled at least half the Board. Stone Point was a private equity firm with a significant investment in Focus. Stone Point was looking for a way to liquidate at least part of its investment in the Company to return capital. It was Stone Point’s interests that drove the timing, and ultimately the terms, of the Company’s sale. Stone Point enjoyed several levers of influence that allowed it to drive the Company’s sale process. At the time of the Merger, Stone Point owned approximately 20.6% of Focus’ shareholder equity and voting power, making it the Company’s single largest shareholder and enabling it to exercise significant control over the direction of the Company. Pursuant to a Nominating Agreement executed in connection with the Company’s IPO, Stone Point enjoyed additional levers of influence that augmented its control over Focus. First, the Nominating Agreement empowered Stone Point to nominate two directors to the Board. Stone Point exercised this right to place Defendants Carey and Muhtadie—two of Stone Point’s Managing Directors—on Focus’ eight-member Board. Defendant Muhtadie was appointed as the purported “lead independent director” at Focus. Second, the Nominating Agreement also empowered Stone Point to designate two of the three members of the Board’s Compensation Committee. Defendants Carey and Muhtadie were designated members of, and constituted two-thirds of, the Committee (with Defendant LeMieux serving as the third member). This gave Stone Point de facto control over all significant decisions concerning compensation of Focus’ senior executives and, therefore, gave Stone Point an extremely potent lever of influence over the members of the Company’s executive management team. This arrangement gave Stone Point significant control over those individuals and, combined with its own two Managing Directors serving on the Board, gave Stone Point direct control over at least four of the eight members of the Board at the time of Focus’ sale process and resulting Merger. As yet another lever of influence, Stone Point exercised a significant amount of power in the context of negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition through Focus’ First Lien Credit Agreement (the “Credit Document”), which the Company entered prior to its IPO. The effect of this arrangement was to grant Stone Point a tremendous amount of power in negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition. If Stone Point and management did not agree to roll over equity into the surviving company, or if an acquiror did not grant Stone Point and management the right to elect a majority of the Board, then Focus’ debt would accelerate under the Credit Document. The acceleration of debt would require the acquiror to find a new source of debt at higher interest rates, increasing the cost of the acquisition for that acquiror. The Proxy does not quantify these costs, but documents produced by the Company indicate that, if the debt was not “portable,” an acquiror would be faced with additional costs of $3.00–$4.00 per share to acquire new debt, based on the deteriorating state of the credit markets at the time. The Proxy also does not disclose that, in order to preserve the Credit Document and avoid acceleration of Focus’ debt, Stone Point would be allowed to control the Board following the Merger. In short, based on its powers under the Credit Document, Stone Point and management could control the sale process, as they would need to agree on the counterparty and participate as an owner of the surviving company—and maintain board control—to ensure the portability of the Company’s debt, lowering costs for the potential acquiror. In theory, Stone Point should have been willing to partner with whichever counterparty offered the best deal for shareholders. But, from the outset, Stone Point acted instead to advance its own interests. Stone Point specifically acknowledged to Goldman Sachs that it was “not agnostic with respect to potential partners in an acquisition of the Company” and “expressed certain views on potential partners”—tipping its hand that it would use its levers of influence to favor potential acquirors that offered the best deal for Stone Point, regardless of whether it was also the best deal for the Company’s public shareholders. Stone Point also had a keen interest in a sale of Focus because Stone Point—along with the Officer Defendants and all members of Focus’ Board, other than Muhtadie and Carey (who themselves stood to benefit indirectly from Stone Point’s interest)—had the right to receive significant payments under Tax Receivable Agreements (TRAs) previously executed with the Company. Specifically, in 2018 and 2020, Focus entered into three separate TRAs with Stone Point-affiliated funds and other parties (the “TRA Holders”). The TRAs provide for the payment by Focus to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings in a given year in federal, state, and local income and franchise taxes that the Company realized, or was deemed to realize, with Focus retaining the remaining 15% of the cash savings. The TRAs provided, however, that the TRA Holders would be entitled to an “Early Termination Payment” if Focus were sold, calculated by using the present value of future tax savings payable under the TRAs. This present value was calculated by using a discount rate of one-year LIBOR plus 150 basis points (i.e., 1.5%), defined as the “Early Termination Rate” under the TRAs. The application of this lower discount rate to measure the present value of the Company’s future tax savings would result in significant additional payments under the TRAs. Furthermore, in a change of control transaction involving Focus, the Company’s payment obligations under the TRAs would accelerate and become payable in a lump-sum payment due at the time of the Merger. Without a sale, the TRA Holders would need to wait more than fifteen years to receive their full TRA Payments, which would also be subject to potential changes in tax laws, subjecting the TRA Payments to additional uncertainty in the ordinary course. The TRA Payments that Stone Point, the Special Committee, the Board, and the Officer Defendants stood to receive created significant unique incentives for these parties to push for the Merger, regardless of whether it was truly value-maximizing for Focus’ public shareholders. Goldman Sachs was concurrently representing management company KSFB in a parallel sale of KSFB and Focus subsidiary NKSFB at the very same time that it was also representing the Board and Special Committee concerning a potential sale of Focus. At least seven potential bidders that were involved in the parallel KSFB–NKSFB sale process were not contacted by Goldman Sachs in connection with the Focus sale process until after the KSFB–NKSFB sale collapsed and the Merger Agreement with CD&R had already been executed. In 2018, KSFB predecessor Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno LLC and its principals sold the assets of their business management firm to Focus, which held the assets via the Delaware wholly-owned subsidiary, NKSFB. At the same time, the principals of Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno LLC formed management company KSFB to provide management services to NKSFB for a fee based on NKSFB’s profits. In mid-2022, Focus and KSFB contemplated a sale of KSFB to Focus. Focus and KSFB had an initial agreement whereby Focus would acquire KSFB, and the parties even settled on a price. By early September 2022, however, Focus backed out of the deal and proposed that the parties team up to pursue a joint sale of both NKSFB and KSFB. Focus pushed for KSFB to hire Focus’ favored investment banker, Goldman Sachs, to represent KSFB’s interests in a sale. KSFB was initially resistant to hiring Goldman Sachs based on the potential for a conflict of interest. But, based on the assurances of Goldman Sachs and Focus that no conflict would arise, KSFB agreed to retain Goldman Sachs in September 2022. In a carefully negotiated nondisclosure agreement executed on October 25, 2022, the parties agreed that Goldman Sachs would “advise and assist [both Focus and KSFB jointly] with respect to a possible strategic transaction involving [NKSFB].” The NDA also prohibited the use of any information the parties received for anything other than their efforts to finalize the sale of NKSFB and KSFB. The joint agreement further required complete transparency among the parties, so that each of the parties would know what the other was doing with respect to the proposed transaction. Instead of honoring the terms of the joint agreement, Goldman Sachs secretly worked with Focus on its parallel sale process to CD&R, which included the sale of Focus’ wholly-owned subsidiary, NKSFB. KSFB had no knowledge that Goldman Sachs and Focus were working on a parallel sale of Focus, which included the sale of NKSFB as a subsidiary, while Goldman Sachs was also meeting with potential acquirors for KSFB and NKSFB. To make matters worse, Goldman Sachs’ lead banker on the engagement team for Focus (Patrick Fels) also led Goldman Sachs’ engagement team for the KSFB–NKSFB sale process. The KSFB–NKSFB sale process involved a broad market canvas, with Focus, Goldman Sachs, and NKSFB identifying over two dozen potential buyers. Focus and Goldman Sachs also had over 300 hours of meetings with KSFB on a potential transaction, sent bid packages to 25 potential bidders for the NKSFB–KSFB business, and had meetings with potential bidders for NKSFB and KSFB. At the same time, Goldman Sachs was engaged in the Focus sale process. Because Goldman Sachs did not want to tip-off KSFB that it was also shopping Focus, the Focus canvas involved a narrower outreach to potential buyers. This limited the universe of potential bidders for Focus, artificially suppressing the sale process for the Company. After the Merger with CD&R was announced in February 2023, the NKSFB sale process collapsed, and KSFB sued Goldman Sachs and Focus in March 2023. Multiple potential bidders that were contacted in the KSFB–NKSFB sale process were not contacted by Goldman Sachs in the initial Focus sale process. Instead, these promising and relevant bidders were only contacted by Goldman Sachs during Focus’ “go-shop” period, after the Merger Agreement between Focus and CD&R had already been executed and the KSFB–NKSFB sale process had collapsed. This included at least seven potential bidders for Focus that were involved in the NKSFB sale process. By shrinking the pool of potential bidders, Goldman Sachs ensured that no bidding war for Focus would occur. While the Proxy makes a passing reference to Goldman Sachs’ dual representation and the KSFB Action, it wholly omits any of the above facts, which would have disclosed to shareholders serious deficiencies with the Focus sale process. The members of the Special Committee stood to receive substantial payments in connection with a sale of Focus. The Proxy represented that the Special Committee was formed because “certain directors of the Company may be deemed to have material interests in a potential take private transaction with CD&R that were different from, or in addition to, the interests of the public holders of Class A Common Stock.” None of the four Special Committee Defendants—LeMieux, Neuhoff, Morganroth, and Feliciani—held any Focus Class A common stock. This is highly unusual for directors of a publicly traded company and demonstrates that these directors’ interests were not aligned with those of Focus’ unaffiliated public shareholders. The Board established the Special Committee by written resolution on November 1, 2022, and designated Defendant LeMieux as Chairman, together with Defendants Neuhoff, Morganroth and Feliciani as additional Special Committee members. Among other things, the November 1 Board resolutions provided a flat fee compensation plan of $80,000 to Defendant LeMieux, and $40,000 each to Defendants Neuhoff, Morganroth and Feliciani for their service on the Special Committee. As the Merger negotiations with CD&R neared completion in February 2023, the Special Committee Defendants sought additional personal compensation. This request was made despite the fact that the Special Committee Defendants had been on the Special Committee for only three months and would already be receiving lucrative change in control compensation in the form of accelerated TRA Payments and unvested equity rewards under the terms of the Merger. At a Special Committee meeting held February 8, 2023, it was noted by Mark Morton, an attorney with the Special Committee’s outside legal counsel at Potter Anderson that “the [Special] Committee believed that the work performed by each of the Committee members and Jefferies on a Potential Transaction was disproportionate to their respective compensation, which had previously been determined based upon factual circumstances and expectations that differed from how the Committee’s evaluation of a Potential Transaction had unfolded.” Morton raised similar points about the Special Committee’s desire for increased compensation several weeks later at a Special Committee meeting on February 25, 2023. This was just one day before the Special Committee met on February 26, 2023 to approve the Merger with CD&R. The Special Committee met on February 26, 2023 to approve the Merger. The Special Committee Defendants adjourned their meeting for approximately 30 minutes to first execute a written consent that materially increased their own compensation. The written consent increasing the Special Committee Defendants’ compensation was also executed by three of the other Board Defendants (i.e., Adolf, Kodialam, and Carey) during the meeting adjournment. Defendant Muhtadie executed the written consent before the meeting. The Special Committee Defendants were unmistakenly incentivized to approve the Merger, as the bulk of these proceeds would only be received if a merger were approved. While the Proxy described these amounts as “not material” for purposes of confirming the Special Committee members’ purported independence and disinterestedness, that characterization is not credible given the sums involved. According to the minutes from a November 10, 2022 Special Committee meeting, the Special Committee Members “affirmed that [the TRA] payments would represent less than five percent of such member’s overall net worth.” But the Special Committee members did not affirm that these payments were insignificant as compared to their annual income. Nor did they claim their TRA Payments were minuscule as compared to their overall finances (e.g., less than of their net worth). Instead, relying on the Special Committee Defendants’ own say-so, the Company concluded that these payments were immaterial because they were not more than of each Special Committee member’s net worth. Even assuming that representation was true, TRA Payments ranging from $73,000 to $255,000 would have been material for these Defendants, as all indications are that they were not enormously wealthy. If these sums were truly immaterial to these Directors, they could have waived them, just as the Special Committee had asked of Stone Point and Company management, and thereby eliminated any potential appearance of a conflict. In the real world, however, nobody would decline to accept payments that are worth up to of their overall net worth, demonstrating the materiality of the TRA Payments to the Special Committee Defendants. Given the substantial payments the Special Committee Defendants gained via the Merger, this information should have been disclosed in the June 12 Definitive Proxy so Focus shareholders could have reasonably assessed the Special Committee’s recommendation with all pertinent facts. Even then, without available information concerning the Special Committee Defendants’ individual finances, investors had no way to assess whether these payments could have influenced the Special Committee’s recommendation. The Special Committee director questionnaires and the professional backgrounds of the Special Committee members show that: (a) certain members lacked the requisite experience in M&A, and as such, were ill-suited to be appointed to the Special Committee charged with overseeing the Focus sale process, and (b) had further conflicts of interest that likely influenced their decision-making on the Merger. Defendant LeMieux was Chairman of the Special Committee and has been a Focus Board member since March 7, 2022. LeMieux is Chairman of the Florida-based law firm of Gunster Yoakley & Stewart, P.A. In the director questionnaire he submitted for appointment to the Focus Board, LeMieux acknowledged that “[m]y law firm represents CD&R in immigration matters.” Accordingly, LeMieux benefits directly from his firm’s ongoing business dealings with CD&R. Defendant LeMieux further acknowledged in his director questionnaire that he has “a personal relationship (friendship) with Rudy Adolf.” Both LeMieux and Defendant Adolf are members of the Young President’s Organization, Palm Beach Gold Chapter, an organization that describes itself as “a group of business owners and presidents who all live in the Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale area.” Defendant LeMieux was also a member of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ 2018 transition team. In 2018, Defendant Carey, a Stone Point appointee to the Focus Board, donated $10,000 to the Republican Governors Association, an organization that provided funding to Governor DeSantis’ political action committee, the Friends of Ron DeSantis. Since Governor DeSantis’ election and as of June 30, 2023, the Florida Retirement System (“FRS”) has invested over $340 million in Stone Point funds. These FRS investments with Stone Point include the fiscal year 2023 investment of over $3.5 million in the Trident Funds that held Stone Point’s 20.6% equity interest in Focus at the time of the Merger. Defendant Neuhoff has been a Focus director since March 7, 2022. Neuhoff has strong personal and business ties to Defendants LeMieux and Adolf. Together with Adolf and LeMieux, Defendant Neuhoff is a member of the Young President’s Organization, Palm Beach Gold Chapter. In addition, since 2019, Neuhoff has served as an advisory board member of the LeMieux Center for Public Policy, an organization founded by Defendant LeMieux in 2012. Defendant Morganroth has been a Focus director since 2020. Morganroth is also a neighbor of Defendant Adolf at a private community in Big Sky, Montana. In his Focus director questionnaire, Morganroth acknowledged that he is a “neighbor + friend” of Defendant Adolf. Morganroth also disclosed that through the he has personal friendships with Defendants Adolf, Muhtadie and Carey. Defendants Carey and Muhtadie were Stone Point appointees to the Focus Board at the time of the Merger. Additionally, Morganroth had prior dealings with Goldman Sachs, as it was reported in 2017 that Goldman Sachs provided Morganroth with a loan for his dermatology business “that could eventually convert to an equity stake.” None of these business and personal relationships between the Special Committee Defendants and Adolf, CD&R and Stone Point were disclosed in the Proxy when it repeatedly represented that the Special Committee was “comprised solely of disinterested and independent directors.” Stone Point’s interests were not aligned with the Company’s unaffiliated public shareholders. As a private equity firm with a significant investment in Focus, Stone Point recognized that Focus was undervalued and would be more valuable as a private entity. Focus’ insiders knew the Company could realize greater value as a private entity by increasing its leverage ratio—an option that would be unavailable to Focus as a publicly traded company. The Proxy states that the Company"

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Founded in 2014, Frequency went public in October 2019. The Company has never earned a profit in any fiscal year and is heavily dependent on the success of FX-322, which is the product the Company was founded to develop. Frequency is also developing a possible treatment for multiple sclerosis, but this product is still in the preclinical stages of development. FX-322 is a treatment Frequency is developing for patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss — or SNHL — which is believed to be caused in part by the depletion of hair cells inside the ear. FX-322 is a proprietary, small molecule drug that is intended to activate progenitor cells within the body. Progenitor cells are descendants of stem cells that then further differentiate to create special types of cells. In simple terms, the Company claims that an intratympanic injection of FX-322 directly into the ear can deliver FX-322 to the cochlea. Once in the cochlea, FX-322 purportedly activates progenitor cells within the body and triggers the regrowth of hairs in the ear. A successful treatment for SNHL would be extremely lucrative. In its IPO offering documents, Frequency explained that it was motivated to develop FX-322 because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had and has yet to approve any drug therapies for the treatment of SNHL. Frequency performed several clinical trials of FX-322. The first trial was solely exploratory and tested whether FX-322 was therapeutically possible. The following “Phase 1” and “Phase 1/2” studies tested the safety of FX-322. Phase 2a was designed to test whether FX-322 was effective as an actual treatment for SNHL. The Phase 1/2 trial of FX-322, which was completed before Phase 2a started, enrolled only 23 patients with mild to moderately severe hearing loss to test solely the safety of FX-322. According to the Company’ October 2020 investor presentation, the results from the Phase 1/2 trial also showed that four of the six enrolled patients with moderate to moderately severe hearing loss had a “statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement” in their hearing. The Company represented that this improvement in hearing was based upon measuring patients’ results on two tests: word recognition and words-in-noise. In a word recognition test, a predetermined list of between 25 and 50 words is read out loud to the patient at a constant volume and the patient is asked to repeat the word he or she has just heard. A patient’s word recognition score is calculated by dividing the number of correctly repeated words by the total number of words on the list. For example, in a word recognition test with 25 words, a patient that correctly identifies 20 of the words will receive a word recognition score of 80%. As word recognition test and a resulting word-recognition score rely heavily on the patient accurately and truthfully reporting what he or she hears to the test’s administrator. Similarly, a words-in-noise, or WIN, test consists of the administration of 70 monosyllabic words divided into two 35 word lists that are pre-recorded with a noisy background. A words-in-noise test is adaptive in that the loudness of the speech fluctuates during the test but the background noise remains constant. A words-in-noise score is calculated based upon how many monosyllabic words can be correctly identified by the patient. As with the word recognition test, the words-in-noise test and resulting words-in-noise score rely heavily on the patient accurately and truthfully reporting what she or he hears to the test’s administrator. In light of the outcome of the Phase 1/2 study, in October 2019, the Company launched Phase 2a. As described in an October 2020 corporate slide deck, the “objectives” of Phase 2a were to: (i) “further establish hearing signal” (i.e., determine the effects of FX-322 as a treatment for SNHL); (ii) “evaluate repeat dosing” to, among other things, determine how much FX-322 was needed to treat SNHL; and (iii) “clarify endpoints and patient population for registration” (i.e., determine the types of patients that would benefit from treatment with FX-322). Phase 2a also had several “exploratory endpoints” to test the effect of treatment with FX-322 on: (i) “word recognition”; (ii) “words-in-noise”; (iii) pure ton audiometry; (iv) quality of life; and (v) “tinnitus.” Phase 2a was supposed to be a “double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center” study of “adults ages 18-65” all of whom “have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Phase 2a had a number of enrollment criteria that potential patients needed to meet in order to become part of the study, as well as certain exclusion criteria that would make a patient ineligible to participate in Phase 2a. Some of those criteria were published by the company, including on the FDA website. According to the FDA, those publicly-available criteria were as follows: Inclusion Criteria: 1. Adults aged 18-65 years inclusive. 2. Established diagnosis of stable sensorineural hearing loss by standard audiometric measures for ≥ 6 months prior to the Screening visit (no changes in air conduction greater than 10 dB at a single frequency or greater than 5 dB at two contiguous frequencies from the prior audiogram to the Screening audiogram in the study ear). 3. Documented medical history consistent with hearing loss being caused by noise exposure or sudden sensorineural hearing loss. 4. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) within 26-70 dB in the ear to be injected. 5. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential or will need to utilize two methods of highly effective contraception during the study participation (e.g. hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device and condoms) or remain abstinent. Male subjects should use condoms with spermicide during the course of the study or remain abstinent. Subjects should not donate sperm or ova during the study period. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Previous participation in FX-322 clinical trial. 2. Currently on any medication consisting of valproic acid, valproate sodium, or divalproex sodium. 3. Perforation of tympanic membrane or other tympanic membrane disorders that would interfere with the delivery and safety assessment of an intratympanic medication or reasonably be suspected to affect tympanic membrane healing after injection in study ear. This includes a current tympanostomy tube. 4. Any conductive hearing loss of greater than 15 dB at a single frequency or greater than 10 dB at two or more contiguous octave frequencies in the study ear at the Screening visit or on the prior audiogram (if the Investigator feels there is not a true conductive hearing loss, the Medical Monitor should be consulted). 5. Active chronic middle ear disease or a history of major middle ear surgery, as an adult, in the ear to be injected. 6. Subject has had an intratympanic injection in either ear within 6 months of the screening visit. 7. History of clinically significant vestibular symptoms at the discretion of the investigator. 8. History of clinically significant systemic autoimmune disease. 9. History of head or neck radiation treatment or exposure. 10. History of platinum-based chemotherapy treatment. 11. Exposure to another investigational drug within 28 days prior to injection of study drug. 12. Evidence of any active or chronic disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator following a detailed medical history, physical examination, and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature). 13. History of substance abuse within 2 years of the Screening Visit. 14. Positive test for drugs of abuse at screening. 15. Positive urine pregnancy test or breast-feeding. 16. Any known factor, condition or disease that, in the view of the Investigator, might interfere with treatment compliance, study conduct or interpretation of the results (e.g. previous high-dose aminoglycoside treatment). In addition to the publicly disclosed inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above, Phase 2a also had “secret,” purportedly undisclosed word-score inclusion criteria. Specifically, all patients needed to score below a certain threshold on a word recognition test. The threshold was established by Frequency as a part of the study design and allegedly to be withheld from the public so as not to bias the entire study. Enrollment in Phase 2a was completed in September 2020. To enroll in Phase 2a, patients had to provide copies of their medical records and, specifically, audiograms, which are graphs plotting the results of a pure-tone hearing test showing how loud sounds need to be at different frequencies to be heard by the patient. All potential enrollees also had screening interviews during which they were asked a series of questions about their hearing loss and medical symptoms by a Phase 2a investigator. Importantly, patients also had to undergo a word recognition test as part of the in-person screening process (and possibly other tests as well). Each patient in Phase 2a was then randomized into one of four treatment cohorts: (i) 24 patients received one dose of FX-322; (ii) 24 patients received two doses; (iii) 24 patients received four doses; and (iv) 24 received a four-dose placebo. Each patient received a weekly injection into one ear containing either FX-322 or placebo and were then tracked weekly for 210 days after the first injection. Frequency first assessed the Phase 2a’s results 90 days after completion of the regimen and again in the months after. Concurrently with the start of the Phase 2a study, in its 3Q 2019 Form 10-Q issued on November 18, 2019, Frequency announced that it would release the results obtained from the study “in the second half of 2020.” The Company pushed back the deadline to release the results to the spring of 2021, blaming the delay on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in its FY 2019 Form 10-K filed on March 26, 2020. At a basic level, bias in the context of a clinical trial refers to any systematic error in a study that encourages one outcome over others. Bias leads to a distortion of the true effects of the drug being studied and will likely result in a study that fails to show any statistically significant or otherwise meaningful results. There are many different biases in clinical trials. For example, “selection bias” is consciously or unconsciously assigning patients with same traits to the same treatment group (e.g., selecting all the men in the study to receive the treatment and all women to receive the placebo). Similarly, “detection bias” occurs when study results are recorded, consciously or unconsciously, in a way that favors the desired outcome of the study. Bias can be the death knell for a clinical trial of a new drug because it undermines the validity of the study’s results. It becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether any effects of the treatment are actually caused by the drug or, instead, if those effects are just the result of bias. Moreover, certain biases are also likely to lead to anomalous and unrepresentative results, which is what happened here. Given how severely biases can undermine an entire clinical trial, there are well-established ways to design a study to mitigate biases. For example, selection bias can be controlled by randomizing who receives the treatment and who receives the placebo, while detection bias can be controlled by “blinding” the investigator as to whether a patient has received the drug or the placebo. This action concerns a systematic error in Phase 2a’s caused by “self selection bias” or “volunteer bias”: Patients were able to intentionally enroll in the study notwithstanding the fact that they did not meet all of Phase 2a’s inclusion criteria. Clinical trials are intended to test drugs on a pre-specified group of patients that is representative of the entire population that has the condition that the drug is intended to treat (in this case, SNHL). Self-selection bias occurs when individuals with certain characteristics intentionally and disproportionately select themselves into a study. As a result of this bias, the pre-specified group of patients in the study ends up not being representative of the entire population. Consequently, the results of a clinical trial infected by self-selection bias cannot be generalized to the larger population and are much more likely to fail to show any meaningful or statistically significant effects. As described in an article from the Journal of Otolaryngoloty — Head and Neck Surgery related to a hearing-loss study, “[r]ecruting an unbiased patient sample population is vital for the scientific rigor of medical research.” As such, “[s]elf-selection bias threatens internal validity when study groups differ” and “[t]he external validity or generalizability of studies is compromised when differences between those who do and do not participate suggest that participates do not represent the target population.” As detailed herein, Defendants knew (or recklessly disregarded) that patients in Phase 2a intentionally misidentified (or failed to identify) words spoken to them as part of a word recognition test, which caused those patients to have artificially low word-recognition scores and thus become eligible for Phase 2a. By self-selecting into Phase 2a in this way, these patients ultimately tainted the study’s results by creating a sample that had better hearing than the overall population with SNHL. The evidence Plaintiff has uncovered so far suggests that at least some patients suffering from tinnitus faked their word recognition tests when they were screened for Phase 2a to obtain early treatment with FX-322. The way to obtain such early access was by participating in a study. Tinnitus commonly presents as a ringing in one or both ears, but it can also sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. Tinnitus is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying issue with the auditory system, which can be caused by different health conditions, such as noise-induced hearing loss, ear and sinus infections, brain tumors, and thyroid abnormalities, among other things. There is currently no FDA-approved cure for tinnitus. In severe cases, tinnitus can cause people to have difficulty concentrating and sleeping, and it can interfere with a person’s daily life and has even been linked to suicide. As a result, individuals with severe tinnitus are notoriously desperate for a cure. The belief that FX-322 could possibly be a cure for tinnitus originated with patients that took part in the Phase 1 trials for FX-322 and anecdotally reported an improvement in their tinnitus after being treated with the drug. Those anecdotes were at least partially confirmed by LeBel. In July 2020, LeBel was interviewed on a podcast called “Tinnitus Talk” (which is related to the online tinnitus support group detailed below, see ¶¶51-57). Lebel was asked if there were “any anecdotes or patient testimonials that kind of corroborate” that FX-322 “might have a profound effect on tinnitus.” He responded: “[W]e don’t have data. Certainly there is anecdotal reports as patients have come back and visited with ENTs when they have had conversations with them about how they are doing. Some of them have offered that they have had improvements in tinnitus, there’s nothing that we can quantitate there. Again, it adds to the excitement of the opportunity” of FX-322. The fact that one of Phase 2a’s exploratory end points was to test the impact of FX-322 on tinnitus was also frequently cited on tinnitus message boards as evidence that FX-322 could potentially treat tinnitus. Plaintiff has identified numerous online message boards discussing FX-322 as a potential treatment for tinnitus. For example, the Tinnitus Talk forum, which is an online support group for sufferers of tinnitus, has an entire message board related to FX-322, including Phase 2a (and the Company’s prior clinical trials). According to one of the website’s founders, as of July 2020, the FX-322 thread on the Tinnitus Talk forum had around 9,000 posts and nearly a million views. Currently, that thread is nearly 650 pages long, with much of the discussion — hundreds, if not thousands of posts — related to Phase 2a. Whether and how to enroll in Phase 2a was a frequent topic of discussion on the Tinnitus Talk forum with many individuals motivated by a desire to gain early access to FX-322 and a potential cure for their tinnitus. As one forum member put it in a post from December 2019: I can tell you that if I could get my hands on FX-322 I’d get shot into my ear today. I have no material concerns that it would harm me given where it is in the approval process. People are literally killing themselves over tinnitus – the risks are worth the potential reward. Similarly, a different forum member remarked in October 2019, “If you really want this [(i.e., FX-322)], participate in a trial.” Several individuals on the Tinnitus Talk forum reported that they had tried to enroll in Phase 2a and had been rejected. The reasons for those rejections were likewise a heavily discussed topic, which often focused around Phase 2a’s enrollment inclusion and exclusion criteria. The publicly available inclusion and exclusion criteria were often quoted and discussed at length of the forum. For example, in a post from November 2019, one forum member said “here is the exclusion criteria” and then listed the 16 publicly available study criteria as they appeared on the FDA’s website. Forum members also compared hearing test results to determine if they were eligible to enroll in Phase 2a. For example, in November 2019 one forum member asked another forum member, “Can you share your audiogram with me if you don’t mind? I still need to get an updated one because mine’s like a year old but I feel like my hearing is not bad enough for me to qualify” for Phase 2a. Most importantly, Phase 2a’ purportedly undisclosed word recognition inclusion criteria were openly discussed on the Tinnitus Talk forum. On February 13, 2020 — while Phase 2a was still actively enrolling patients and a full seven months before enrollment ended — Form Member A made the following post on the FX-322 forum: So quick update everyone: Unfortunately[,] I was officially rejected. The reason they gave is that they need at least 85% or less word score recognition and mine is 100% (which is slightly odd because I did say several times I couldn’t understand the words but shrug). I know a lot of people asked for the reason they were rejected and weren’t give one but the Torrance location seems to be extremely forthcoming with information, and didn’t hesitate to tell me at all. Not sure why. But ultimately it looks like they are looking for a combination of audiogram loss and depleted word scores. Best of luck to anyone still trying to get in. In fact, on March 23, 2021 — the very day the Company revealed the bias in Phase 2a — that same Forum Member A posted the following on the FX-322 forum: I actually fear I might have been unknowingly complicit in the whole fraud thing, if that turns out to be truly legitimate. Most people were not given the reason for their rejection from the Phase 2a trial, but I was. They point blank told me that although my audiogram qualified me, my WR scores did not, and I shared that here on the forums… my intention was to save people the hassle,"

      "summary": "This case involves a putative securities fraud class action against Wells Fargo and its senior executives. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made false and misleading statements about Wells Fargo’s compliance with three 2018 Consent Orders issued by federal regulators. The Consent Orders required Wells Fargo to overhaul its governance, risk management, and compliance risk management programs. The Federal Reserve imposed an unprecedented asset cap on Wells Fargo until it achieved compliance with the Consent Orders. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made numerous false and misleading statements about the Bank’s compliance with the Consent Orders, artificially inflating the Bank’s stock price. The truth was revealed through a series of partial disclosures, resulting in the removal of artificial inflation and causing economic injury to the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of a class of investors who purchased or acquired Wells Fargo common stock during the period from February 2, 2018, to March 12, 2020, and who suffered losses when the truth was revealed. The Court previously granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. The Court dismissed all claims against Defendants Scharf and Shrewsberry, the claims based on certain alleged misstatements, and the claims brought by Plaintiffs Handelsbanken and Louisiana Sheriffs. The Court denied the motion to dismiss as to the claims brought by Plaintiffs Mississippi and Rhode Island against Defendants Wells Fargo, Sloan, Duke, and Parker, based on the remaining alleged misstatements. The Court also denied Defendants’ motion to strike certain references to the House Reports. Defendants now move for reconsideration of the Court’s order denying in part their motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. Defendants argue that the Court made a clear error of law in holding that the House Reports are judicially noticeable only for their findings and not for the truth of the facts underlying those findings. Defendants contend that the Court must take judicial notice of the House Reports for the truth of the underlying facts, which would render the remaining alleged misstatements non-actionable. The Court disagrees and denies the motion for reconsideration.",

      "summary": "This is a putative securities class action brought by shareholders of Lottery.com Inc., formerly Trident Acquisitions Corp. (“TDAC”), against Lottery.com, certain of its officers and directors, and TDAC’s former directors. The action arises out of a business combination between TDAC and Lottery.com in the fall of 2021, which was approved by TDAC’s shareholders at a special meeting held on October 28, 2021. The surviving entity continued as Lottery.com and became a publicly traded company. As a result of the business combination, TDAC’s shareholders who did not redeem their shares in connection with the vote to approve the business combination became shareholders of the new publicly traded company. The following allegations are drawn from the consolidated class action complaint, which is the operative complaint in this action. TDAC was a blank check, special purpose acquisition company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 17, 2016, for the purpose of entering into a business combination. TDAC’s stated purpose was to locate and acquire a company doing business in the energy/oil sector in Eastern Europe. TDAC filed its IPO prospectus with the SEC on May 30, 2018. On June 1, 2018, TDAC consummated the IPO of 17,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of $201,250,000. As of June 5, 2018, a total of $205,275,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of the IPO were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. TDAC had until December 1, 2019, to consummate a business combination. If the Company was unable to consummate a business combination by then, the Company would be required to cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, and liquidate and dissolve the company. TDAC was authorized to seek stockholder approval for an extension of this deadline. However, if such an extension was approved, TDAC was required to provide shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon approval of any such amendment to the deadline. TDAC sought and obtained three extensions of the deadline, and each time, a portion of shareholders sought to redeem their shares. With each extension and corresponding redemptions by shareholders, the Individual TDAC Defendants saw their financial interest in the company continue to dwindle. Moreover, as the Individual TDAC Defendants were certainly aware, as redemptions occurred, the amount of funds TDAC had access to for an acquisition greatly declined, further shrinking the available pool of potential companies for which a potential acquisition by TDAC would be enticing. On November 19, 2020, with another business combination deadline fast approaching, TDAC announced that it had signed a letter of intent to combine with Lottery, which was then a private company. Founded in 2015, AutoLotto, Inc., doing business as Lottery.com, was an Austin, TX-based company. Lottery represented itself to be: (1) a leading online platform to play the lottery, offering official state-sanctioned lottery games like Powerball, Mega-Millions and other state games, in the U.S. and around the world; and (2) the world’s largest provider of lottery data – such as current and previous winning numbers, jackpots and draw dates, jackpot analysis and more, covering almost 600 lottery games in 38 countries in real time – to over 400 digital publishers, including hundreds of digital newspapers, television and news sites, and major digital publishers such as Google, Verizon/Yahoo, Amazon’s Alexa devices and more. TDAC’s announcement regarding a letter of intent with Lottery disclosed that the transaction would be structured so that Lottery’s stockholders would roll 100% of their equity into the business combination, with no minimum cash requirement, and that the parties anticipated closing the business combination in first quarter of 2021. On October 29, 2021, the Company announced the completion of the Business Combination, and upon the closing, the combined entity was renamed Lottery.com. On November 1, 2021, Lottery’s common shares and warrants began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbols “LTRY” and “LTRYW,” respectively. Plaintiffs allege that, to drum up support for the business combination, Defendants touted Lottery’s purportedly strong revenue figures and future prospects, as well as its strong relationships with state regulators. In the proxy statement and prospectus on Form 424B3, dated October 18, 2021, through which Defendants solicited approval of the Business Combination, the Company represented that Lottery’s revenue projection for fiscal 2021 was $71 million. On November 15, 2021, following the completion of the Business Combination, the Company reported $32.25 million revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2021. Lottery specified that the “increase in revenue was driven by several factors including a $30 million sale of affiliate marketing credits,” during the quarter. As such, nearly all of the $32.25 million in revenue for the quarter was derived from a single sale of marketing credits to an affiliate. Thereafter, on April 1, 2022, the Company disclosed that its 2021 fiscal year revenue was $68.5 million, which was “driven by the sale of $47.1 million in LotteryLink Credits for prepaid advertising, prepaid lottery games, marketing materials and development services in the third and fourth quarters of 2021.” Notably, the Company reported accounts receivable of just $21.7 million. Since the accounts receivable figure was lower than the amount of the $30 million sale of LotteryLink Credits announced the prior quarter, the Company was representing to investors that it had been paid, at least partially, by the customer who purchased the aforementioned $30 million of “affiliate marketing credits.” However, as investors subsequently learned, there was no revenue from the purported $30 million sale. As such, Lottery’s representation that it had collected this revenue was false. Plaintiffs allege that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants attempted to maintain the illusion, as represented in the Proxy soliciting approval of the Business Combination, that the Company had significant revenue growth, that it had adequate internal controls over financial reporting, and that the Company was in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As the Company ultimately admitted, throughout the Class Period, Defendants misrepresented and/or omitted to disclose material facts to investors regarding the financial and operational health of Lottery, including with respect to the Company’s cash position and revenue, its regulatory compliance, and the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting. Beginning on July 6, 2022, a series of disclosures revealed the true state of Lottery’s financial and operational condition. On that date, Lottery disclosed that an internal investigation had revealed “issues pertaining to the Company’s internal accounting controls” and “instances of non-compliance with state and federal laws concerning the state in which tickets are procured as well as order fulfillment.” On this news, Lottery’s shares fell more than 12%, or $0.15, from a closing price of $1.22 per share on July 5, 2022 to a closing price of $1.07 per share on July 6, 2022, on abnormally high volume. Little more than a week later, on July 15, 2022, the Company announced that its Chief Revenue Officer had resigned on July 11, 2022. Providing an update on its internal investigation, the Company stated that it “preliminarily conclude[d] that it has overstated its available unrestricted cash balance by approximately $30 million and that, relatedly, in the prior fiscal year, it improperly recognized revenue in the same amount.” On this news, shares of Lottery fell more than 14.5%, or $0.14, from a closing price of $0.96 per share on July 15, 2022 to a closing price of $0.82 per share on July 16, 2022, on abnormally high volume. A week later, on July 22, 2022, Lottery further disclosed that (i) the Company’s auditor determined that financial statements for the full-year fiscal 2021 and first quarter 2022 should no longer be relied upon, and that a Company subsidiary entered into an undisclosed line of credit in January 2022, and (ii) troublingly, its CEO and co-founder, Lawrence Anthony “Tony” DiMatteo III, was resigning, effective immediately. On this news, Lottery shares declined another 12%, or $0.10, over the next two trading days, from a closing price of $0.82 per share on July 22, 2022 to a closing price of $0.72 per share on July 26, 2022. Finally, on July 29, 2022, investors continued to learn about Lottery’s previously concealed problems. Lottery revealed that its “capital resources are not sufficient to fund its operations for a twelve-month period and, therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.” The Company also disclosed that it did not have “sufficient financial resources to fund its operations or pay certain existing obligations, including its payroll,” that it therefore intended to furlough “certain employees,” effective July 29, 2022. The market had clearly not been conditioned to the Company’s dire condition, as on this news, shares declined 64%, falling $0.52 per share, from a closing price of $0.81 per share on July 28, 2022 to a close of $0.29 per share on July 29, 2022. Things only worsened after the Class Period. Two weeks after the furlough announcement and the “going concern” disclosure, on August 16, 2022, the Company revealed that it had “furloughed the majority of its employees effective July 29, 2022,” and absent being able to “secure additional capital resources,” it would “be forced to wind down some or all of its operations and pursue options for liquidating the Company’s assets.” Since that time, the Company has ceased to report financial results, or issue financial statements, for any and all periods subsequent to the first quarter of 2022 (i.e., for the second, third and fourth quarters, and full year, of 2022), purportedly because it “has not yet finalized its reviews of its financial statements or its assessment of the impact of the findings of the ongoing review of the Company’s internal accounting controls on its historical financial statements.” In short, Lottery’s entire senior management was terminated or resigned. Lottery’s auditor resigned citing an inability to rely on management. And the Company’s entire board of directors turned over. Additionally, the Company is all but insolvent and has warned of going-concern risk and imminent liquidation unless it secures some funding. Meanwhile, Lottery still has not reported financial results or issued financial statements for any period following Q1 2022, and is still yet to complete its investigation into the effects of improprieties and controls weaknesses on its historical financial statements. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiffs and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.",

      "summary": "Plaintiff alleged that Capone fabricated his educational background, falsely inflating the value of a future purported contract with CBP, and stated to investors that DocGo had signed up thousands of migrants for the New York State Medicaid Managed Care Plan offered through UnitedHealthcare. The Company is a technology company that operates in the healthcare transportation and mobile services industry. Its clients include hospitals and health systems, health plans, governments, and municipalities in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company’s business is divided into two segments: Transportation Services and Mobile Health. The Transportation Services segment provides emergency response and nonemergency transportation services offered under the Ambulnz brand, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of DocGo after the Business Combination. The Mobile Health segment provides healthcare at home and offices, testing, vaccinations, and event services, including onsite healthcare support at sporting events and concerts. DocGo’s government vertical was the Company’s largest by a significant margin. The Company’s government vertical was aided by a surge in COVID-19 testing and other services related to COVID-19. With the pandemic winding down in late 2022 and early 2023, DocGo sought to transition its Mobile Health division away from a COVID-19 testing-centric business to cover a wider range of population health services. One way DocGo sought to do this was by seeking government contract opportunities by responding to RFPs. During the Class Period, defendants made multiple statements regarding DocGo’s RFP process and DocGo’s growing ability to pursue larger and more lucrative government contracts. Analysts covering DocGo viewed DocGo’s RFP efforts as a material component of the Company’s future growth and upside. In spring 2023, DocGo won a no-bid $432 million contract with the HPD that took effect in early May 2023. The HPD contract was the largest contract DocGo had ever received from New York City (or any other state or local government) and nearly matched the Company’s total reported revenue in 2022 of $440.5 million. Soon after the HPD contract became effective in May 2023, reports surfaced of DocGo’s disruptive behavior in the communities in which the Company had relocated migrants. Reeling from mounting public scrutiny and negative media attention earned from DocGo’s poor performance on the HPD contract, Capone sought to reassure investors about the Company’s performance and future prospects. On August 9, 2023, the day after Albany leaders convened a press conference to rebuke DocGo, Capone presented at the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference in Boston, Massachusetts. During the presentation, Capone highlighted a purported $4 billion contract in DocGo’s pipeline with CBP to provide medical services for asylum seekers at the southern border, stating the HPD contract had given DocGo the credibility necessary to win it. Capone’s statements regarding the value of the CBP contract and DocGo’s ability to leverage the HPD contract into the much larger CBP contract were also repeated in various news outlets. The purported $4 billion CBP contract would have been, by a factor of nearly ten, DocGo’s largest government contract win in the Company’s history. For reference, for the year ended December 31, 2022, DocGo reported total revenues of just $440.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, DocGo reported total revenues of $318.7 million. Capone also told investors DocGo could use the HPD contract to transition patients in DocGo’s population health vertical into the Company’s payer vertical by signing migrants up for New York State Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare. Analysts covering DocGo commented positively on Capone’s stated focus of growing DocGo’s payer and corporate vertical, as these verticals provided increased stability for the Company. On September 10, 2023, the Times Union published an article reporting that the five-year contract to provide medical services at the southern border for CBP is far below the $4 billion Capone cited in his comments to investors, according to a spokeswoman for the agency. The Times Union also reported Capone’s statements to investors about signing migrants onto New York State Medicaid were also false. The Times Union quoted a DocGo spokesperson confirming that DocGo does not enroll anyone in Medicaid. The Times Union also reported a UnitedHealthcare representative reported DocGo did not even have a contract with UnitedHealthcare in New York. On September 14, 2023, the Times Union published an article titled: “No record that DocGo CEO Anthony Capone earned graduate degree,” which was later updated to: “DocGo CEO Anthony Capone admits he didn’t earn graduate degree.” In the article, Capone admitted he did not have a master’s degree from Clarkson University, nor from any other institution. Capone’s admission, however, was itself false and misleading as what he claimed to be an inaccuracy in his public biography was in fact a blatant fabrication Capone had repeated at least ten times seeking to bolster his and DocGo’s credibility and prospects with investors and customers. On September 15, 2023, after the markets closed, DocGo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing Capone’s immediate resignation, purportedly for personal reasons. That same day, the Times Union published an article titled: “DocGo CEO resigns following report he lied about college degree.” The article questioned whether Capone had an undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam, noting Capone stated only that he had an undergraduate degree from an accredited university and his spokesman declined to respond to questions about whether he graduated from SUNY Potsdam. The decline in the price of DocGo common stock after the corrective disclosures came to light was a direct result of the revelation of the nature and extent of defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions to investors and the market. The timing and magnitude of the price declines in DocGo common stock compared to the market and its peers negate any inference that the loss suffered by Lead Plaintiff and the other Class members was caused by changed market conditions, macroeconomic or industry factors, or Company-specific facts unrelated to defendants’ fraudulent conduct. The economic loss, i.e., damages, suffered by Lead Plaintiff and the other Class members was a direct result of defendants’ misstatements and omissions and the subsequent significant decline in the value of DocGo common stock when defendants’ misrepresentations and other fraudulent conduct were revealed. The Court dismissed the complaint for failure to plead scienter under the PSLRA, finding that the allegations did not give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent or recklessness. The Court noted that the complaint relied on conclusory allegations, fraud by hindsight, and speculation about what defendants must have known, rather than particularized facts showing actual knowledge of falsity. The Court also found that innocent explanations for defendants’ conduct were equally or more plausible than fraudulent intent. The Court dismissed the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims, as well as the Section 20(a) control person liability claims, as they were derivative of the underlying securities violation.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"Mobileye is a technology company that develops and deploys advanced driver-assistance systems (“ADAS”)—which includes safety features such as emergency brake assistance, as well as lane-departure and blind-spot warnings—along with other autonomous driving technologies and solutions. Mobileye first went public in 2014 but was subsequently acquired by Intel Corporation in 2017. Several years later, in October 2022, Intel spun Mobileye off and Mobileye became a standalone public company again (the “IPO”). At all relevant times, Mobileye was the incumbent and dominant player in the ADAS market, repeatedly touting that it held approximately 70% of the market share in the growing ADAS market. Mobileye’s competitors also repeatedly acknowledged Mobileye as the biggest player in the ADAS market. For instance, in its SEC filings, Mobileye identifies Qualcomm and Ambarella as two of its largest competitors. Just before the start of the Class Period, Qualcomm’s CFO described Mobileye as the “incumbent clearly in ADAS.” Likewise, during the Class Period, the CEO of Ambarella readily admitted that Mobileye “really dominate[s] this market.” Based on Mobileye’s overwhelming dominance in ADAS, analysts believed that Mobileye was uniquely positioned to capture even more of the growing ADAS market and concluded that Mobileye’s ADAS market dominance justified a premium price for Mobileye stock. For instance, when they initiated coverage of the Company, analysts from Tigress Financial Partners took note of the “increasing demand for ADAS capabilities” and wrote that Mobileye’s “significant R&D investments, first-mover advantage, and industry-leading product portfolio combined with significant OEM relationships, well-position it to capitalize on a massive market opportunity.” Analysts from Cowen likewise lauded Mobileye as a “rare scaled pure-play and beneficiary of ADAS/autonomy,” stating that Mobileye’s “[s]trong growth and a wide data moat” meant that it would be difficult for competitors to steal business from Mobileye. Nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue comes from the Company’s proprietary EyeQ system-on-chip (the “EyeQ”). First launched in 2007, the EyeQ is essentially a combination of hardware and software which allows car manufacturers to implement ADAS features into their vehicles. While the EyeQ is not Mobileye’s only product, the EyeQ is “fundamental to [Mobileye’s] leadership position in ADAS,” as the Company has explained, and critical to its performance. For instance, in 2022, Mobileye sold approximately 33 million EyeQ chips, which made up 89% of its reported revenue of $1.9 billion. Almost all of the Company’s remaining revenue comes from sales of Mobileye’s SuperVision system, a more advanced autonomous driving system which itself utilizes EyeQ technology. In other words, EyeQ chips drive nearly all of Mobileye’s revenue. Mobileye primarily sells the EyeQ chip to “Tier 1” automotive suppliers, who function essentially as intermediaries between Mobileye (a “Tier 2” supplier) and car manufacturers (known as Original Equipment Manufacturers or “OEMs”), which include companies such as Ford or Volkswagen. The graphic below illustrates the relevant portion of the Mobileye and EyeQ supply chain. As Mobileye disclosed in its SEC filings, the Company relied significantly on sales to a handful of Tier 1 customers, including Aptiv PLC, Magna International, Valeo, and ZF Group. The overwhelming majority of Mobileye’s revenue comes from sales to these Tier 1 suppliers. For example, in 2023, ZF Group, Valeo, and Aptiv were Mobileye’s three biggest customers and generated nearly 70% of Mobileye’s revenue. Over decades, suppliers and manufacturers in the automotive industry have developed and implemented standards and practices to coordinate and streamline the distribution of components needed to manufacture automobiles. Among other things, these standards dictate that suppliers engage in a near-constant exchange of information, which allows each part of the supply chain to manage its inventory levels. As a May 2017 article from Automotive Logistics explained: “The typical automotive supply chain is an extended global network of suppliers, 3PLs [logistics providers], forwarders and carriers. Each company in this chain has their own systems in their silos. They work off forecasts, schedules and orders communicated by the OEM which are cascaded down to each tier of suppliers.” Tier 1 suppliers indicated that they followed industry practices with respect to supply chain management, including with regard to inventory reporting and disclosure. These supply chain management practices typically include the electronic exchange of information, including inventory levels and forecasted demand data between suppliers, in order to optimize inventory levels commensurate with manufacturing demand. Tier 1 customers typically placed orders using Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) systems, a specialized electronic industry platform that replaces paper-based documents for purchase orders or invoices and allows for instant electronic communication up and down the supply chain. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the accompanying supply chain shortages caused participants to further focus on the importance of managing inventory levels across the supply chain. For example, according to a November 2021 report issued by OpenText, an information management solutions company, the “COVID-19 pandemic exposed major vulnerabilities in widely used business models. For industries across the world, standard approaches such as just-in-time and build-to-order were found wanting. To build resilience and agility, the focus has turned to demand planning and forecasting to better match inventory to actual customer requirements.” As another example, in 2023, the Automotive Industry Action Group (“AIAG”)—an automotive trade association that, among other things, sets forth industry standards and practices to execute on the industry standards to provide regular exchange of inventory and demand information—issued a “Best Practices for Responding to Supply Chain Disruptions” guide, in which AIAG stressed the need to “establish specific parts forecast vs. firm orders [] to avoid oversupply of outdated/soon-to-be-outdated parts,” engage in “transparent communication with the suppliers,” use “EDI messaging,” and generally to “proactively communicate with suppliers on current expectations.” While there are several different processes used in supply chain management across the automotive industry, these systems all share key features, including that information concerning inventory levels and demand forecasts be exchanged frequently. As described below, Mobileye’s major customers all utilized some form of communication with other supply chain participants and/or otherwise expressly affirmed their observance of the industry standards described above, meaning that Defendants at all times received regular reports about inventory and demand from customers. ZF Group. Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customer during the Class Period, ZF Group, publicly provides a “Global Logistics Directive,” which applies to “all production materials and the associated spare parts purchased by the locations of ZF Group worldwide,” as well as “to all suppliers providing those production materials and associated spare parts to ZF.” Under this directive, ZF expressly adopts for use with suppliers different standards for communication regarding inventory and demand levels. As the Global Logistics Directive makes clear, “The overall obligation of ZF’s suppliers is to secure the delivery of ZF. This requires supplier to make a regular comparison between the MRP [material requirement planning] data from ZF and supplier’s available short-, mid- and long-term capacities . . . Supplier shall take also such additional demand data into consideration for its capacity planning.” Under each standard, described as “call-off procedures,” the supplier is given detailed information regarding ZF’s demand needs. Valeo. Another of Mobileye’s three largest Tier 1 customers, Valeo, states in its publicly available materials that it implements EDI communications to regularly report inventory and demand information to its suppliers. For example, under the publicly-available Valeo Supply Agreement Schedule that Valeo used in the ordinary course during the Class Period with its Tier suppliers (such as Mobileye), Valeo each week provides its Tier 2 suppliers with materials requirement forecasts for the following two months, at minimum. Aptiv. Another of Mobileye’s top Tier 1 customers, Aptiv, stated in its “Customer Specific Requirements” effective June 20, 2022—which applied to “Suppliers that provide direct products or materials for Aptiv,” (such as Mobileye)—that the supplier needs to be certified “as a capable and compliant EDI trading partner,” meaning, use the industry standard EDI protocol. The requirements further indicate that Aptiv provided information to suppliers as to expected production scheduling for the next 2-4 weeks, as well as information beyond four weeks “for planning purposes.” FE 1,1 an Aptiv former employee, corroborated that Aptiv used EDI with Mobileye, including specifically to provide Mobileye with both (i) 18-month forecasts, which projected demand over the long-term, and (ii) firm orders every two weeks, ensuring that Mobileye knew Aptiv’s immediate demand for the EyeQ chip throughout the Class Period. Magna. Finally, as to Magna—another of Mobileye’s largest Tier 1 customers— Mobileye had in July 2014 attached to its public Form F-1 filed with the SEC a purchase schedule between the Company and Magna, which expressly stated that Magna would on a regular basis provide Mobileye with a “items identified as ‘FORECAST’ on a Purchase Schedule [that] are for planning purposes,” thus indicating Mobileye and Magna complied with industry-standard communications around inventory and demand. Magna’s insistence on these practices is further corroborated by Magna’s publicly-available “Magna Global Supply Chain Requirements” manual, dated March 30, 2017, which was “applicable to all suppliers providing materials, products and services to any Magna manufacturing facility.” That manual sets forth specific requirements that forecasting information be sent “to the suppliers through their regularly scheduled releases.” Moreover, Magna is a member of AIAG, the automotive trade association described above that sets forth industry standards, and practices to execute on those standards, to provide FE 1 worked as a Procurement Manager from August 2003 until March 2011; a Central Procurement and Customer Logistics Manager from March 2011 until May 2017; and a Production Planning and Customer Logistics Manager from May 2017 until February 2024. In each role at Aptiv, she focused on logistics, including procurement, production planning, supply chain, and customer service. FE 1 specifically said that she had direct communication with Mobileye at times, and that her group had to monitor Mobileye very closely. regular exchange of inventory and demand. This included issuing the “best practices” in 2023 that specifically advised “to avoid oversupply of outdated/soon-to-be-outdated parts” through “transparent communication with the suppliers,” the use of “EDI messaging,” and “proactively communicat[ion] with suppliers on current expectations.” In all respects, the fact that all of Mobileye’s customers regularly communicated with Mobileye regarding their inventory levels and current demand is corroborated by, among other things, Mobileye’s own statements throughout the Class Period, which touted their “continuous contact with customers.” Moreover, this is also confirmed by FE 2,2 who explained that all of Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers provided reports to Mobileye, which among other things, would update Mobileye on a change in the needs of the Tier 1 customers. These reports, FE 2 explained, were received by Mobileye’s entire commercial team. Investors That Mobileye Is Well-Positioned For Future Growth The Class Period begins on January 26, 2023, when Defendants issued a press release announcing Mobileye’s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. Mobileye announced $1.9 billion in revenue for 2022—35% year-over-year growth—driven by a significant increase in EyeQ revenue. The press release stated that Mobileye “continue[d] to execute very well in our core ADAS business” and specifically that EyeQ-related “revenue grew 48% in the [fourth] quarter due to a combination of volume and ASP growth.” Defendants attributed the Company’s success to a host of legitimate factors, including additional “Volume and ASP [average system price] growth.” Based on these revenue drivers, Defendants asserted that Mobileye had “significantly outperform[ed] underlying global auto production growth.” FE 2 worked in several roles at Mobileye since joining the Company in 2010, and was Mobileye’s Vice President of ADAS Business Development from September 2020 until the end of 2022, when she left the Company. In that role, she focused on securing business from Tier 1 customers and OEMs. During the Company’s earnings call with analysts that day, Defendant Heller again touted the Company’s 48% revenue growth from EyeQ sales, while Defendant Shashua further boasted that the Company had grown “revenue with every one of our top 10 customers in 2022” in its core EyeQ business segment. That day, Mobileye also issued impressive financial guidance for 2023, projecting revenue between approximately $2.2 and $2.3 billion, indicating more than 20% year-over-year growth. In issuing this guidance, Defendants assured the market that it was “conservative.” Discussing further during the earnings call, Defendant Heller stated that Mobileye’s guidance “assum[ed] EyeQ volume that is somewhat below the commitment that we have received from our customers for 2023. We want to remain conservative and acknowledge that the macro uncertainty remains elevated.” Defendants did not provide any further detail as to these commitments. Rather, in saying that Defendants chose to be “conservative” in their guidance by assuming growth below those “commitments,” Defendants indicated that the volumes Mobileye shipped could change based on market conditions throughout the year. Defendants also guided that revenue for the first quarter of 2023 would be lower than the just-announced fourth quarter 2022 revenue. Defendant Heller told investors that this was due to two factors: “general conservatism on the part of [Mobileye’s] customers” and higher purchases of EyeQ chips by Mobileye’s customers in late 2022 before Mobileye raised prices for the EyeQ at the start of January 2023. Defendants told investors that customers were therefore entering the Class Period with somewhat elevated levels of inventory following extra purchases during the fourth quarter of 2022, specifically because Mobileye was planning to increase prices and Mobileye’s customers wanted to take advantage before the new prices were in effect. While Defendants claimed to know why inventory levels may have been elevated, Defendants never disclosed by how much inventory had increased. In any event, Defendants assured the market that this dip in revenue growth for the first quarter of 2023 would only be temporary, and reiterated their guidance that the Company would still post 20% growth in 2023 overall, with approximately 60% of Mobileye’s 2023 revenue coming in the second half of the year. This conveyed to investors that, to the extent there were any elevated inventory levels at its customers at that time, those inventories would quickly dissipate and not impact the Company’s growth. Analysts lauded Mobileye’s strong 2022 results and positive 2023 guidance, particularly against the backdrop of the supply chain constraints in recent years. For example, analysts from J.P.Morgan raised their price target for Mobileye and declared that “Mobileye’s 4Q22 results served to alleviate investor concerns around the broader implications of a tough macro backdrop and the reverberating headwinds.” The analysts also lauded that Mobileye had “bak[ed] in conservatism even at the high end of the guidance range.” Analysts from Deutsche Bank similarly cheered Mobileye’s “better-than-expected 4Q22 operating results versus expectations across the board” and their announced 2023 guidance that had exceeded the street’s estimates. Morgan Stanley analysts who reported on Mobileye’s “Big 4Q Beat,” credited Mobileye’s 2023 projections as “a conservative guide,” and said they were “prepared to see quarterly beats along the way in 2023,” confirming the market’s understanding that volumes shipped would track market conditions. In response to Defendants’ positive representations, Mobileye’s stock price rose from a close of $33.95 on January 25, 2023 to close at $35.97 on January 26, 2023—an increase of approximately 6% in a single trading day. As the year continued, Defendants stated that the Company would continue to grow volumes and revenue in light of growing demand, even in the face of supply chain pressures. On March 9, 2023, Mobileye filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K, in which Defendants stated that, to counteract supply chain shortages, “certain Tier 1 customers [had] increased their orders for components and parts” in certain unspecified prior periods. However, while the Form 10-K suggested some “increased” sales had “shifted to earlier time periods,” “some demand . . . and corresponding revenue,” Defendants did not provide further detail. Instead, Defendants reassured investors that, in any event, they expected demand to continue to grow, stating that “ADAS volumes have grown faster in recent years than the overall automotive market as ADAS penetration rates have increased,” Mobileye was “outperforming the increase of global automotive production,” and Mobileye “believe[d] that we will continue to benefit from that trend.” In all events, Defendants further assured investors that the volume of Mobileye’s shipments to its customers would “depend upon market conditions,” and that “to mitigate [] supply chain constraints, management is monitoring inventory levels on an ongoing basis.” These representations provided assurances to investors that Mobileye’s sales related to actual market demand, and therefore further assured investors as to the quality and nature of its present revenue as well as the sustainability of Mobileye’s growth, which was critical to the market’s valuation of the Company. Inventory and volumes were of particular interest to analysts, who asked questions about the issues throughout the Class Period, and in response Defendants spoke frequently on the subjects. For instance, Mobileye held its earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 on April 27, During that call, Defendant Heller told analysts that “based on the latest indications from Tier 1[s],” Mobileye had “seen some movements of volumes out of Q2 and into the second half of the year”—in other words, certain customers postponed orders of EyeQ chips until the second half of 2023. An analyst from Goldman Sachs asked Defendants to “elaborate a little bit more on what might be happening there.” In response, Defendant Heller indicated that Defendants analyzed shipments relative to demand, noting that the decision by the Tier 1 customers was “probably something to do about their inventory levels and considerations versus demand,” based on “the information that” Mobileye had, but assured this analyst that the amount of volume that Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers had moved to the second half of 2023 was “not very significant.” Defendant Shashua jumped in and further assured investors that “we are in a very good discussions and trying to balance their commitment from quarter to quarter rather than lumping it into one or two quarters towards the end of the year. And we managed quite successfully to reach a point in which the change in second quarter is really minimal.” Defendants’ assurances about Mobileye’s continued growth and focus on balancing supply to its customers encouraged the market. Analysts from Barclays wrote that “the growth opportunity is very much intact.” Likewise, analysts from Cowen noted that the “[o]verall thesis and Mobileye’s content/vehicle expansion [was] firmly intact.” On July 27, 2023, Mobileye announced financial results for the second quarter of The Company again assured investors that Mobileye was “positioned well for the increased"

      "summary": "The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead scienter under the PSLRA. The PSLRA requires plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with intent to deceive or with reckless disregard for the truth. Plaintiffs' allegations rely on general corporate knowledge, confidential witness statements, and post-Class Period admissions, which do not establish that the Individual Defendants had actual knowledge of the alleged falsity of their statements when made. The confidential witness statements do not indicate that the Individual Defendants were aware of the purportedly negative impact of the NDC strategy during the Class Period. The post-Class Period admissions do not support a strong inference of scienter as they do not reveal contemporaneous knowledge of falsity. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs' allegations do not show that the Individual Defendants were aware of the alleged adverse facts at the time of the statements. As a result, Plaintiffs have not met the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA for scienter. Consequently, the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims are dismissed, and the Section 20(a) claims are also dismissed as they are derivative of the primary claims.",
