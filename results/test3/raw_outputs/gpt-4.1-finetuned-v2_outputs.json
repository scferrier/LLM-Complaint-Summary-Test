      "summary": "Carvana is an e-commerce company that sells used cars. It was founded in 2012 by Ernest Garcia II and his son Ernest Garcia III, along with defendants Ryan Keeton and Benjamin Huston. Carvana initially operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of DriveTime, another used-car business owned by Garcia II. In 2014, however, Carvana was spun off from DriveTime. Carvana went public in 2017. At that time, the Garcias together held 97% of the voting power in Carvana, with Garcia II holding 56% ownership of the company. The Garcias maintained close control over Carvana throughout the relevant period. As the company’s controlling shareholder, Garcia II maintained over 80% of the voting power in Carvana. Garcia III served as the company’s CEO and Chairman of the Board. Keeton was Carvana’s Chief Brand Officer and Huston was the company’s Chief Operating Officer. In addition to the Garcias, Keeton, and Huston, defendant Mark Jenkins served as Carvana’s CFO. Lead plaintiffs are two multi-employer defined benefit pension plans that purchased a significant number of shares of Carvana’s Class A common stock during the putative class period. In April 2022, plaintiffs also purchased shares of Carvana Class A common stock in a public offering. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a classic pump-and-dump scheme, in which Carvana’s stock price was artificially inflated so that defendants could sell their personal holdings at inflated prices. Plaintiffs allege that defendants’ scheme was executed in two phases: the growth phase and the profit phase. According to plaintiffs, the growth phase began in 2020, when defendants allegedly implemented a scheme to artificially inflate Carvana’s retail sales. Plaintiffs allege that defendants achieved this by abruptly ramping up buying cars from customers by lowering the company’s purchasing and verification standards, embarking on a rapid and unsustainable nationwide expansion plan to enter over 150 new markets, and violating state title and registration laws to quickly push through sales. Plaintiffs allege that, in the profit phase, defendants changed course to focus on profitability, rather than growth. Plaintiffs allege that defendants achieved this by slashing expenses, eliminating less profitable sales, and attempting to patch Carvana’s nationwide logistics network. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions during both the growth and profit phases. Plaintiffs allege that, during the growth phase, defendants made false and misleading statements regarding retail sales growth, the benefits of buying cars from customers, Carvana’s nationwide market expansion, Carvana’s title and registration practices, and Carvana’s cost advantages over traditional used car retailers. Plaintiffs allege that, during the profit phase, defendants made false and misleading statements regarding retail sales growth, the benefits of buying cars from customers, Carvana’s nationwide market expansion, Carvana’s title and registration practices, and the factors impacting Carvana’s logistics network and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of defendants’ scheme, Carvana’s stock price increased by more than 318% during the putative class period. Plaintiffs allege that defendants took advantage of the inflated stock price by selling nearly 15 million shares of their personal holdings of Carvana stock for proceeds of more than $3.87 billion. Plaintiffs allege that, once the scheme was revealed to the public, Carvana’s stock price declined by more than 97%. Plaintiffs commenced this putative class action on May 18, 2022, and filed an amended complaint on February 14, 2023. The amended complaint asserts six claims under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. The amended complaint asserts three Exchange Act claims against Carvana, the Garcias, Keeton, Huston, and Jenkins (collectively, the Exchange Act defendants): a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim against all Exchange Act defendants, a Section 20(a) claim against the Garcias, Keeton, Huston, and Jenkins, and a Section 20(A) claim against the Garcias, Keeton, Huston, and Jenkins. The amended complaint also asserts three Securities Act claims against Carvana, the Garcias, Keeton, Huston, Jenkins, Stephen Palmer, Michael Maroone, Neha Parikh, Ira Platt, Greg Sullivan, Citigroup Global Markets, and J.P. Morgan Securities (collectively, the Securities Act defendants): a Section 11 claim against all Securities Act defendants, a Section 12(a)(2) claim against all Securities Act defendants, and a Section 15 claim against the Garcias, Keeton, Huston, Jenkins, Palmer, Maroone, Parikh, Platt, and Sullivan. Defendants now move to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).",

      "summary": "The Court dismissed all of Plaintiff’s Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims because Plaintiff failed to adequately plead scienter. Under the PSLRA, Plaintiff was required to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter, i.e., that Defendants made false or misleading statements with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness as to the truth or falsity of the statements. The Court found that Plaintiff’s allegations of scienter were insufficient because they were based on general corporate knowledge rather than particularized facts showing that the Individual Defendants knew their statements were false when made. Plaintiff’s allegations included conclusory statements that the Individual Defendants, due to their positions, must have known about the extent of account sharing. However, the Court held that such allegations do not satisfy the PSLRA’s heightened pleading standard. The Court also found that Plaintiff’s allegations were contradicted by Netflix’s public statements, which acknowledged the existence of account sharing but did not indicate it was a material inhibitor to growth. The Court further noted that Plaintiff’s allegations amounted to fraud by hindsight, as they were based on Netflix’s later disclosures about the extent of account sharing. The Court emphasized that innocent explanations for Defendants’ conduct, such as their reliance on internal data that underestimated account sharing, were equally plausible as fraudulent intent. The Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies in pleading scienter. The Court also dismissed Plaintiff’s Section 20(a) control person liability claims, as they are derivative of the underlying Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to plead a primary violation of the Exchange Act, which is a prerequisite for control person liability. The Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies in the Section 20(a) claims.",

      "raw_response": "{\"summary\": \"This securities fraud class action arises from Defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions about Lucid’s production of the Company’s only commercially-available electric vehicle (“EV”), the Lucid Air (the “Air”), and the factors impacting that production. At all times, Defendants concealed the severe, internal, Company-specific problems that were actually slowing production, including internal logistics issues, design flaws, and the key drivers of parts shortages. Instead, Defendants blamed Lucid’s woes on the purported impact of external, industry-wide supply chain problems and repeatedly assured investors that the Company was “mitigating” that global impact. These misrepresentations left investors with a materially false and misleading impression about Lucid’s actual production and internal ability and readiness to mass produce its vehicles. Against that backdrop, Defendants then lied, time and again, about the number of vehicles Lucid would produce. When the relevant truth about Lucid’s disastrous internal logistics and production issues was finally revealed to the market over two partial corrective disclosures, Lucid’s common stock price cratered, causing substantial damage to the Company’s investors. Defendant Lucid designs, produces, and sells luxury EVs. The Company evolved from a startup called Atieva, Inc. (“Atieva”), which initially produced and sold EV batteries and electric powertrains to EV companies. In 2013, Atieva decided to shift its business model and produce its own EVs. To spearhead the transformation, Atieva hired industry-veteran Peter Rawlinson (“Rawlinson”), who had overseen the development of Tesla, Inc.’s (“Tesla”) Model S from 2009 to 2012. Atieva changed its name to Lucid in 2016. That same year, the Company unveiled a prototype of its first vehicle—a luxury EV sedan it dubbed the Lucid Air. It also announced plans to build a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and said it would begin producing the Air by 2018. Since it was unveiled, the Air’s design has garnered high praise. Market commentators called it “a technological breakthrough” and heralded it as one of “the most compelling automotive launches in recent years.” But as one commentator noted, “a prototype, no matter how lovely, does not make a[n] automaker,” and “there’s quite a gulf between designing a great car and producing and selling that car.” Ultimately, Lucid’s success hinged entirely on its ability to ramp up commercial production of the Lucid Air. That is because the Air was essentially Lucid’s only source of potential revenue, and the Company could not recognize significant revenue from sales of the Air until it was able to mass produce vehicles and deliver them to paying customers. The speed at which Lucid ramped production was also critical, for at least three reasons. First, although the Company boasted a substantial book of preorders for the Air, it had to get vehicles to customers before they got tired of waiting and cancelled their refundable orders. Second, while the EV market still had relatively few players, it was imperative for Lucid to quickly get production off the ground and grab market share before additional competitors entered the market. Third, the Company was burning through billions of dollars in cash getting production off the ground, and the longer it took to start bringing in substantial revenues from the Air, the greater the chances that it would run out of funds. Simply put, Lucid’s ability to quickly ramp production would determine the Company’s future. And in that realm, as commentators noted, Lucid “remain[ed] entirely unproven.” In the years that followed the Company’s unveiling of the Lucid Air prototype, Lucid struggled to raise much-needed cash as a private company, leading it to repeatedly delay the start of production. In 2018, desperate for capital, Lucid inked a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), to provide $1 billion in funds in exchange for the majority interest in the Company. Despite this infusion, by the beginning of 2021, Lucid still had not commenced commercial production of the Air and was again running low on cash. As a result, Lucid decided to seek funding from a new source—investors on the public market. On February 22, 2021, Lucid announced plans to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV (“Churchill”) in order to bring the Company public through a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) transaction (the “Merger”). At the time, the Merger was the largest proposed SPAC transaction in history, and would provide Lucid with $4.4 billion in cash. Rawlinson was desperate to close the Merger, as he knew that cash was critical to Lucid’s ability to continue growing as a company. Indeed, when the Merger was announced, Lucid disclosed that it was so cash-strapped that it would require $600 million in bridge funding to continue its operations until the Merger closed. Rawlinson was also highly motivated to close the Merger because he knew that, in doing so, he would not only earn a $2 million bonus, but would lock down a lucrative compensation package with a potential value of approximately $556 million. Lucid’s Board of Directors had approved the framework for Rawlinson’s compensation package before the Merger was announced, but made clear that “[s]uccessful merger completion” was necessary “to receive the grant at all.” As the Merger approached, Rawlinson knew that investors were laser-focused on whether Lucid would finally be able to ramp up production of the Air after years of delay. To ensure that the Merger went through and provided Lucid with critical funding, he and the Company took a number of steps to convince investors that it would, in fact, quickly ramp up production of the Air and begin generating substantial revenues. For example, in a February 22, 2021 investor presentation announcing the Merger, Rawlinson and Lucid told investors that the Company would produce 20,000 vehicles by the end of 2022, thus garnering more than $2 billion in 2022 revenues. Rawlinson continued to drive investor interest in Lucid by reiterating its 2022 production guidance in the run-up to the July 2021 Merger, assuring investors in May 2021 and July 2021 that Lucid would produce 20,000 EVs in 2022. Even with the investor interest generated by Defendants’ repeated production promises, on the day the Merger was scheduled to close (July 22, 2021), Defendants had yet to garner the necessary votes from Churchill shareholders. So, that day, Rawlinson implored investors to “please, please vote,” and again reiterated that Lucid was ‘“energized about going into full production mode’ later this year.” A day later, on July 23, 2021, the Merger closed. Lucid’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq on July 26, 2021. By going public through the SPAC Merger, Lucid secured $4.4 billion in additional funding and Rawlinson secured a $2 million bonus and a staggering $556 million in potential stock option compensation. Furthermore, because of the structure of Rawlinson’s stock option package—more than half of his options would only vest if the Company hit certain market capitalization targets within five years of going public—he remained highly motivated to keep Lucid’s common stock price inflated. As Rawlinson admitted, “I’m all in on stock options[,] that’s what motivates and drives me.” Thus, in the months that followed the Merger, Rawlinson continued to try and prop up Lucid’s stock price by assuring investors that Lucid was on track to meet its production targets. On September 28, 2021, Lucid announced that—after multiple delays—it had finally begun production of the Air. Lucid made its first deliveries of the Air to customers on October 30, 2021. The Class Period begins on November 15, 2021—the day that Lucid announced its first quarterly results as a public company. On that day, Defendants told investors that they were “confident in [their] ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022.” As for potential risks to that production, Defendants expressly directed investors only to then-existing “ongoing challenges facing the automotive industry, with global disruptions to supply chains and logistics,” but, in the same breath, assured investors that “[w]e are taking steps to mitigate these challenges.” These statements were blatantly false. In the weeks leading up to November 15, 2021, Rawlinson himself admitted internally that Lucid would miss its production targets. In particular, according to former employee (“FE”)-2, during a meeting in October 2021 or the first week of November 2021, Rawlinson told a small group of Lucid employees that the Company would miss its targets and would produce less than 10,000 vehicles in 2022. Rawlinson further instructed the employees at the meeting to keep the fact that Lucid would miss its 2022 production target confidential. Moreover, multiple former Lucid employees confirm that prior to Defendants’ November 2021 statements, Rawlinson was told that Lucid would not meet its 2022 production targets, and that the fact that Lucid would not meet this target was widely understood and discussed within the Company, including by Lucid’s top executive management. Defendants also knew at all times leading up to and throughout the Class Period that Lucid was suffering from severe and pervasive internal problems unique to Lucid that made it impossible for the Company to mass produce vehicles. Thus, contrary to Defendants’ assurances, the then-existing headwinds Lucid was experiencing were neither transient nor borne by the industry as a whole, but were internal, structural in nature, widespread, and ongoing. Nevertheless, when analysts pressed Defendants for answers concerning the status of Lucid’s production of the Air, they lied. Specifically, Defendants claimed that the main sticking point was whether the Company would be impacted by global supply-chain and logistics challenges impacting the automotive market as a whole, and that Lucid was already taking steps to mitigate these issues. In truth, Defendants knew or were reckless in disregarding that Lucid suffered from severe internal, Lucid-specific issues that were significantly hampering its ability to produce vehicles. To start, Lucid’s inventory management systems were entirely ineffective and inoperable. This meant that the Company’s employees and other workers in Lucid’s Warehouse (defined below) lacked even the most basic information necessary to run the Warehouse, including that they had little or no information about how many parts the Company actually had at any given time, or even where parts were, and thus could not locate them when the production line requested them. This, in turn, negatively impacted Lucid’s ability to efficiently reorder parts because it was unable to tell when inventory was low on or when it had run out of a particular part. This chaos was compounded by the fact that Lucid’s Warehouse was operating significantly above capacity, which not only made it difficult to locate parts in piles stacked up to the ceiling, but also resulted in tens of millions of dollars in parts being smashed and destroyed. As a result of these and other significant internal logistics issues, the Company was unable to get parts from its Warehouse to its production line in a timely manner, which resulted in frequent production shutdowns. Indeed, former Lucid employees described the Warehouse as “a complete mess” and “utter chaos,” and confirmed that the vast majority of the Company’s production delays resulted from its failing internal logistics systems. These severe internal logistics issues were plaguing Lucid by no later than the summer of 2021, and persisted until at least the summer of 2022. Even when Lucid’s production was slowed by actual parts shortages—as opposed to an inability to find the parts or get them to the production line—former employees confirmed that many such shortages were problems of Lucid’s own making. This was because the design of the Lucid Air was not sufficiently developed before production was launched and certain parts were not designed for manufacturability. That meant that suppliers were not able to produce parts to meet Lucid’s specifications, causing Lucid to rush to make multiple design changes even after production of the Air had already commenced, or labor to build vehicles with out of spec parts. This, in turn, led to production delays. These facts were well-known by Defendants from day one of the Class Period. Prior to November 2021, Rawlinson and his top lieutenants were directly told about the severe issues in the Warehouse, and the negative impact that they were having on Lucid’s ability to produce vehicles. In addition, Rawlinson knew, based on discussions at internal meetings, that the Air’s design was not where it needed to be before Lucid launched production, which caused parts shortages and last minute design changes. Still, beginning on November 15, 2021, Defendants concealed all of these internal issues that were already having a severe and negative impact on Lucid’s production, and instead told investors that the main risk to the Company’s targets was industry-wide supply chain issues, and that they were already mitigating those risks. This gave investors the false and misleading impression that internally Lucid was ready and able to quickly ramp up production, when in truth it was anything but. Analysts and the financial media reacted positively to Defendants’ assurances. For example, the following day, CNBC reported that “[Lucid’s] market capitalization surpassed that of Ford Motor on Tuesday as investors reacted to management confirming production plans for 2022[.]” Bloomberg similarly wrote that Lucid shares “closed up 24% in New York, bringing its value to over $91 billion. . . . The surge in the shares came after Lucid said Monday it remained confident in its ability to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022.” Defendants proceeded to then take full advantage of Lucid’s artificially inflated stock price. First, on December 8, 2021, Lucid announced a public offering of convertible senior notes. As market commentators noted, by using “[o]pportunistic timing” and “[t]aking advantage of a strong stock price,” Lucid was able to raise over $2 billion in gross proceeds to fund its business. Second, by January 25, 2022, Rawlinson had maintained Lucid’s high market capitalization for long enough to trigger four out of the five tranches of his performance-based stock options. As a result, Rawlinson received nearly 14 million Lucid stock options that were valued at approximately $263 million as of April 28, 2022. Despite having known for months that Lucid would produce less than 10,000 units in 2022, even in mid-February 2022, Defendants still falsely assured investors that Lucid would produce 20,000 cars by year-end. Just two weeks later, however, on Lucid’s February 28, 2022 earnings call, Defendants did an abrupt about-face, admitting that Lucid would miss its 20,000 vehicle target by up to 40%, and slashing the Company’s 2022 production guidance to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles. On this news, Lucid’s stock price fell more than 13%, from a close of $28.98 per share on February 28, 2022, to a close at $24.99 per share on March 1, 2022. Market commentators likewise reacted negatively, calling Lucid’s “massive” guidance cut “particularly disappointing,” a “clear disappointment,” “jarring,” and a “[f]all from grace,” and noting that it “sen[t] shares . . . tumbling” and “plunged Lucid into an uphill battle to regain investor trust.” They further noted that “[t]he biggest threat to Lucid is that it misses on its already lower guidance and further slashes guidance in the coming quarters.” Defendants, of course, knew that Lucid would miss even its reduced guidance figures as a result of the severe internal issues it was facing. Lucid’s internal logistics issues had not improved but, rather, as Rawlinson knew, were only getting worse. As a result, Defendants’ statements on February 28, 2022, were materially false or misleading, and Lucid’s stock price remained artificially inflated. Lucid’s stock price also remained artificially inflated because Defendants continued to conceal the severe internal logistics problems that Lucid was experiencing, and instead misleadingly pinned the blame again on global supply chain and logistics problems that were impacting the automotive industry as a whole. For example, during the February 28, 2022 call, Defendants repeatedly blamed “ongoing, industrywide challenges in logistics and supply chains,” “supply chain challenges” felt by “many manufacturers,” and “supply chain challenges that you’ve heard about in numerous companies across industries this earnings season.” As a result, investors were left with the false and misleading impression that Lucid was primed and ready to mass produce its vehicles, but was being constrained by industry-wide factors. Analysts again credited Defendants’ explanation, reporting that Lucid’s guidance reduction was the result of “supply chain problems,” ‘“extraordinary’ supply-chain pressures,” and “supply chain constraints,” and noting that Lucid “is getting absolutely crushed by short-term challenges such as higher component costs, supply chain issues, and higher shipping costs.” For the remainder of the Class Period, Defendants continued to point to those purported global, industry-wide supply chain issues as the main obstacle to Lucid producing vehicles, while concealing the severe internal logistics issues that were hampering its actual production. On the back of these misrepresentations, Defendants falsely reaffirmed Lucid’s production guidance of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles throughout the spring of 2022. For example, during the Company’s May 5, 2022 1Q22 earnings conference call, Defendants again reiterated Lucid’s 12,000 to 14,000 guidance and continued to point to global supply chain issues as the main factor impacting and risk to Lucid’s production, noting that “we are reiterating our 12,000 to 14,000 guidance for the balance of the year, so long as the supply chain logistics disruptions aren’t material and our mitigation plans are effective.” None the wiser, analysts latched onto and repeated Defendants’ statements and false assurances, reporting, for example, that “LCID reiterated its 2022 outlook of 12K-14K units production” and that the Company “does see supply chain disruptions from China as the most likely risk.” Bloomberg similarly reported that Lucid “reaffirmed its plans to make as many as 14,000 plug-in vehicles this year” and that the Company was “work[ing] to overcome supply-chain challenges that are gripping the automotive industry.” Just a few months later, on August 3, 2022, the relevant truth concealed by Defendants’ false and misleading statements and omissions was fully revealed to the market. That day, in reporting Lucid’s 2Q22 results, Defendants finally revealed what they had known all along—that the Company would make less than 10,000 units in 2022, slashing Lucid’s guidance again, this time to 6,000 to 7,000 units. Moreover, although they claimed to have just discovered them, Defendants finally disclosed that Lucid’s inability to ramp production had been caused primarily by severe internal logistics problems unique to Lucid. For example, departing from Lucid’s prior scapegoating of global supply chain issues, Rawlinson explained that recent developments had “exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes,” which he conceded were the “primary"

The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend to address the deficiencies identified in the prior order. Plaintiffs subsequently filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which reasserts claims against Mowry, Varma, Harris, Drummond, and Cutera. Defendants moved to dismiss the SAC, arguing that it fails to cure the deficiencies identified in the prior order. The Court found that the SAC adequately alleged falsity for statements regarding the AviClear rollout, but failed to plead falsity for the internal controls statements.

      "summary": "Rain Oncology Inc. was a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on developing therapies for patients with cancer. Avanish Vellanki served as Rain’s CEO and Richard Bryce was the Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. In September 2020, Rain obtained a worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under Daiichi Sankyo’s know-how and seven families of patents and patent applications to make, have made, use, import and export milademetan. Milademetan is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (“MDM2”), which is oncogenic in numerous cancers. MDM2 is a protein in humans that can accelerate tumor growth if left unsuppressed. MDM2 inhibitors have historically been associated with severe hematologic events. Daiichi Sankyo conducted milademetan’s Phase 1 clinical trial, which took place between July 2013 and October 2020. It was a single-arm, open-label study designed to test milademetan in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas. When initiated in July 2013, the study represented the first clinical trial in which milademetan was administered to humans, i.e., a first-in-human study. One of the Phase 1 trial’s primary objectives was to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose, according to Daiichi Sankyo’s study plan. The Phase 1 trial consisted of two parts: Part 1 was a dose-escalation part aimed at identifying the maximum tolerable dose; and Part 2 was a dose-expansion part to test the safety and tolerability of potential doses. Part 2 was ultimately abandoned after Daiichi Sankyo determined it could not meet the objectives under its dosing schedule because the dose identified as effective was not tolerable, i.e., the dose was too toxic for study participants. During the trial, milademetan was initially given orally once daily on a 28-day cycle at a starting dose of 15 mg. Due to excessive toxicity, Daiichi Sankyo explored intermittent dosing schedules and ultimately identified a recommended dose for further evaluation of 260 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 15 to 17 every 28 days. This dose was not part of the initial study protocol but instead identified while the Phase 1 trial was underway. Only 16 study participants with dedifferentiated liposarcoma received this dose in the Phase 1 trial. This subgroup of study participants demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months (compared to 2.1 months under current standard of care treatment). On April 23, 2021, Rain filed its final prospectus in conjunction with its IPO. The prospectus stated that Rain in-licensed milademetan in September 2020 based on the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of liposarcoma and other solid tumors. The prospectus also stated that data from well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcoma patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of milademetan demonstrated median progression-free survival approximately three to four times greater than trabectedin or eribulin, the current standard of care. The prospectus stated that Rain anticipated commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial in liposarcoma in the second half of 2021. Rain’s IPO raised $121.9 million in net proceeds. On July 20, 2021, Rain commenced its Phase 3 trial for milademetan, referred to as the “MANTRA” trial. The MANTRA trial was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care, in patients with unresectable or metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma with or without a well-differentiated liposarcoma component that has progressed on one or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy. The primary objective of the trial was to compare progression-free survival by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. On September 20, 2021, Daiichi Sankyo published results from a separate clinical trial testing milademetan in patients with intimal sarcoma. The trial results reported unusually high rates of hematologic toxicities, including Grade 3 events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreases, and anemia. The results also included a 20% objective response rate. The study participants received 260 mg doses of milademetan. In response to the news, Rain’s stock price declined from $15.88 per share on September 17, 2021 to $13.21 per share on September 20, 2021. On May 22, 2023, Rain announced topline results for the MANTRA trial. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression free survival. Rain announced that the median progression-free survival for milademetan was 3.6 months versus 2.2 months for trabectedin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89. The most common treatment emergent adverse events in the milademetan arm included nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and neutropenia. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (39.5%), neutropenia (25.5%) and anemia (18.6%). Dose reductions in the milademetan arm were 44.2% versus 29.1% in the trabectedin arm. Discontinuation in the milademetan arm due to adverse events were 11.6% versus 19.0% for trabectedin. Treatment emergent serious adverse events in the milademetan arm were 36.0% versus 48.1% in the trabectedin arm. Analysts from several top-tier investment banks downgraded Rain in response to the news. In their reports, the analysts noted the risks of proceeding directly to a Phase 3 trial from Phase 1. They also noted that the Phase 3 trial results included more Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events than anticipated. According to the analysts, the elevated level of adverse events suggested that the dosing schedule had not been properly optimized during the Phase 1 trial. Analysts also noted that Rain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Robert C. Doebele, acknowledged during a conference call earlier in the day that the 260 mg dose was too high. In response to the news, Rain’s stock price declined from $9.93 per share on May 19, 2023 to $1.22 per share on May 22, 2023. Rain abandoned its clinical trial plan for milademetan after the Phase 3 trial failed. On May 22, 2023, contemporaneously with the announcements of the Phase 3 trial results, Rain confirmed that it was no longer pursuing any line of therapy involving milademetan for the treatment of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Given that dedifferentiated liposarcoma was the highest probability indication for an MDM2 inhibitor, analysts immediately lowered their models for Rain while investors likewise decided to exit their positions in the stock. On May 28, 2023, Rain suspended ongoing clinical development of milademetan. The Company also decided to wind down research and development activities, implement a substantial reduction in force, and initiate a review of strategic alternatives. Rain’s Board of Directors also instructed management to identify potential financial advisors to assist the Company in connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives. On May 30, 2023, Rain announced plans to suspend further development of milademetan, including suspension of enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2 MANTRA-2 basket trial and the termination of plans for its Phase 1/2 MANTRA-4 combination trial, as well as a reduction in headcount of approximately 65%, and a plan to evaluate alternatives to enhance its pipeline through precision oncology program acquisitions or other transactions. On August 10, 2023, Rain reported its financial earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company announced it had decided to discontinue the entire development program for milademetan, including its other ongoing MANTRA studies. Rain also announced it had decided to focus on cost-saving measures, including a reduction in force, and was actively looking for new opportunities to license or acquire clinical-stage programs and technologies. On October 17, 2023, Rain entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Pathos AI, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing artificial intelligence-powered pathology tools. The purpose of the agreement was to allow both companies to share information with one another to negotiate a merger or acquisition. On November 16, 2023, Rain and Pathos AI executed a proposal whereby Pathos AI would acquire Rain through a tender offer. On December 13, 2023, Rain announced the acquisition by Pathos AI. According to the announcement, Pathos AI will acquire Rain for $1.16 per share plus contingent value rights equaling approximately $0.17 per share based on the deal closing and milademetan’s first patient dosing within five years. Rain shareholders presently have until January 25, 2024 to tender their shares under the terms of the acquisition agreement.",

      "summary": "Fastly operates an edge cloud platform for processing, serving, and securing customer’s applications. Fastly’s platform includes a Content Delivery Network (“CDN”), or a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. Content owners, such as media companies and e-commerce vendors, pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In other words, Fastly’s customers are delivering web experiences, whether in the form of applications, websites, or streaming services. Certain companies have adopted a “Multi-CDN” framework which combines multiple CDNs from various providers into one large global network. The bulk of the Company’s revenue is derived from its existing customers’ use of Fastly’s platform, although the Company generates some revenue from additional products and other services, such as account management and customer support. Fastly charges customers based on their use of the Company’s platform and typically enters into contracts that include a monthly minimum billing commitment in exchange for more favorable pricing terms. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, roughly 95% of the Company’s revenue was derived from customers’ use of its platform and new customers contributed less than 10% of that revenue. The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated by its enterprise customers, which, as explained more fully below, were previously defined as those customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the trailing 12-month period, but are currently defined as those customers with annualized current quarter revenue in excess of $100,000, which is calculated by taking the revenue recognized in the current quarter and multiplying it by four. The Company’s ten largest customers, which one confidential witness referred to as “big whales,” include large streaming accounts and other accounts in the media space such as TikTok, Amazon Video, Apple, Twitter (X), Netflix, Paramount, and Disney. These customers account for a significant portion of the Company’s revenue, generating 37% of the Company’s revenue in FY 2023. Thus, a decline in revenue from the Company’s existing enterprise customers, especially its largest customers, or a decline in retention of such customers, could create volatility in the Company’s revenue and materially impact Fastly’s business. Against that backdrop, beginning in November 2023, Defendants began to mislead investors about how macroeconomic trends and uncertainties (i.e., the impact of rising interest rates, banking instability, and recession fears) were affecting the Company’s business. During a November 15, 2023 conference, in response to a question about whether “macro trends” were getting better, Nightingale replied: “The biggest pressure that people saw in this area was like in small to medium SMB customers, maybe some of the mid market. We don’t have a lot of exposure there. . . . [s]o I didn’t see too many headwinds. The only thing we saw was a little bit of elongated deal flow.” When pressed, Nightingale responded, “My competitors are seeing these effects, some slowing in growth, and [] we’re not seeing that” (emphasis added). However, according to one confidential witness, such statements were “BS,” and Nightingale was “probably just trying to keep the share price afloat.” That same confidential witness explained that 30 to 40% of the Company’s sales team was dedicated to the small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) segment of the market. Another confidential witness, who worked with mid market enterprise customers, described how beginning in March and April of 2023, customers began requesting more aggressive discounts. There was a direct correlation between when customers began asking for these discounts and when interest rates began rising significantly. In addition, one confidential witness explained that, contrary to Nightingale’s November 2023 public statements, macro forces, such as rising interest rates, were “definitely in the business cycle” and in fact, negatively affecting the Company’s revenues overall throughout 2023, including revenues from Fastly’s largest customers, who were increasingly more price-conscious. Adding to the pressures on Fastly was the fact that Fastly’s competitors (i.e., Cloudflare, Akamai, and Imperva) in the CDN market had caught up to the Company in technological prowess. Thus, Fastly had far less leverage in negotiating prices with its customers. The previously downplayed risks of macro effects on the Company’s business began to materialize when the Company announced its Q4 and FY 2023 financial results on February 14, 2024. The Company reported revenues of $506 million for FY 2023 and $137.8 million for Q4 2023. The reported Q4 2023 revenue was on the lower side of their previous guidance and, according to Zacks Investment Research, missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1%. In response to this news, Fastly’s stock price fell significantly, from $23.54 to close at $16.34 on February 15, 2024, a decline of 30.59 %. However, Defendants continued to mislead investors by making misleading statements about the Company’s customer retention rates and its existing customers’ continued expansion of their use of Fastly’s services. During the February 14, 2024 earnings call with investors and analysts, Nightingale stated that the Company’s “customer retention efforts were stable in the fourth quarter.” When pressed by analysts on whether there were fundamental changes to the business in light of macroeconomic trends and uncertainties affecting the Company, Nightingale stated unequivocally in the conference call, “No, I think it was pretty much as we saw last quarter. A handful of deals may be taking a little longer than we thought, a little bit of deals elongation.” However, according to various confidential witnesses, in 2023, the appetite for Fastly’s services was declining. These confidential witnesses describe how numerous enterprise customers were canceling their contracts in 2023 and it was very difficult to land new clients. For example, Indeed and USAA did not renew their contracts with Fastly in 2023. In or around March and April of 2023, some enterprise customers began requesting steeper discounts when negotiating contract renewals with Fastly. The revenue decline became apparent to one confidential witness in November 2023, when they began to struggle to meet sales quotas. By the end of 2023, only 30 percent of salespeople met their revenue targets. Customers continued to experience a stagnation in growth in 2024. Both the macro impacts on the Company’s business and the declining appetite for Fastly’s services was well known throughout the Company and the Company’s C-Suite because the Company regularly held quarterly “all hands” meetings at the Company’s San Francisco office, which discussed the overall state of the business, including, but not limited to, the effect of macro forces on the Company’s business in 2023. All hands meetings typically were held a week after the Company’s earnings calls and would provide a recap of what was discussed during the earnings call. They would include slide deck presentations and were attended by the Company’s C-Suite and all employees, who either attended in-person or could tune into the meetings live via Vimeo. Recordings of the meetings were distributed to all employees by email after the meeting. By November 2023, during these all hands meetings, Nightingale was discussing how the Company’s largest accounts were not bringing in as much traffic to Fastly. Specifically, during the November 2023 all hands meeting, which occurred shortly after Fastly’s November 1, 2023 Q3 2023 earnings call, Nightingale spoke about “decreasing revenue from [the Company’s] big customers” and discussed how Fastly’s large media accounts had “throttled down” their usage, warning that a specific streaming company was “throttling things back, which is why revenue is down” (emphasis added). One confidential witness corroborated seeing this trend with their customers, stating that “New business really started falling off a cliff in Q4.” The decline in traffic was also known to Defendants because the Company’s top executives – including, occasionally, Nightingale – attended weekly meetings throughout the relevant period, during which the Company’s customers were rated based on how much traffic they were transmitting through Fastly’s platform. If a major enterprise customer continued to be rated poorly, a “tiger team” was assembled to focus on improving that customer’s performance. Notwithstanding the discussion behind the scenes about the Company’s largest customers “throttling things back” in November 2023, during the February 14, 2024 earnings call, Nightingale also misleadingly attributed the Company coming in at the lower end of its guidance range to “weaker than anticipated international traffic, offset by seasonally strong live streaming and gaming activity” while omitting the critical information that a substantial contributor to the revenue decline was several of the Company’s largest customers simultaneously experiencing a decline in traffic. Defendants continued to make similarly misleading statements in its annual report filed on February 22, 2024, touting that the Company’s existing enterprise customers were increasing their spend on Fastly’s platform and continuing to drive the Company’s revenue growth. Further, Defendants claimed that any chance of its existing customers decreasing their use of Fastly’s platform was a hypothetical risk, despite the fact that the risk had already materialized. Additional negative information corrective of Defendants’ prior misrepresentations emerged on May 1, 2024, when Fastly hosted an earnings call to discuss the Company’s Q1 2024 financial results. During that call, Defendants decreased the company’s FY 2024 revenue projections from a range of $580 million to $590 million to a range of $555 million to $565 million, blaming the decline in revenue on some of the Company’s largest customers. Specifically, Defendants disclosed that the “biggest factor” contributing to a revenue decline was “a reduction of revenue from a small number of [the Company’s] largest customers,” explaining that there was “a slight uptick from the typical level of rerates with [the Company’s] largest customers,” which was not accompanied by “the commensurate traffic expansion usually associated with this motion.” When pressed for further detail on the timing of that pricing pressure from some of the Company’s largest accounts, Kisling clarified “[A] lot of that arose really at the end of March and in early April” with “negotiations result[ing] in bigger discounts than we thought that did not come with the typical increase in traffic that we’ve seen historically.” Analysts reacted negatively to the volatility with some of the Company’s largest customers. For example, on May 2, 2024, BofA downgraded Fastly stock from “Buy” to “Underperform,” citing the “[d]ecelerating growth in Fastly’s largest customers” as a basis to question “a rebound in 2024.” Similarly, D.A. Davidson downgraded Fastly’s stock from “Buy” to “NEUTRAL,” expressing concern about the Company’s apparent expectation to “recover[] traffic with large customers,” and stating “[w]e cannot get comfortable with that premise given what’s transpired over the last two quarters.” Following these developments, Fastly’s stock price fell $4.14 per share, or 32.02%, to close at $8.79 per share on May 2, 2024. Nevertheless, Defendants continued to withhold the full truth from investors about the Company’s revenue prospects from its existing enterprise customers, including its largest customers. During the May 2, 2024 earnings call, Nightingale portrayed the revenue decline from the Company’s top customers as stabilizing, stating: “Right now, we have already launched a new engagement model. We’re driving a far higher touch across all those major accounts. We’ve been running it for a couple of weeks now, and we’re – I’m pretty happy with the progress so far.” In reality, Defendants had not made any progress with its largest customers. To the contrary, according to one confidential witness who was tasked with developing a product for two of the Company’s largest customers, Apple and Amazon, Apple and Amazon had been requesting the product since 2023 and the Company promised to deliver it by the end of 2023, but the Company had not even begun working on it until May 2024. Nightingale told that confidential witness to do whatever was needed to get the project done. Defendants also continued to mislead investors about the Company continuing to drive growth through existing customers. In the Company’s Q1 2024 Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q on May 1, 2024, Defendants repeated that the Company is “focused on . . . expanding [its] relationship with existing customers” and “emphasize[s] retaining [its] customers and expanding their usage of [Fastly’s] platform and adoption of [the Company’s] other products.” However, by that time, Defendants had shifted the Company’s focus away from driving revenue growth through existing customers, implementing a new sales strategy using a new compensation model in 2024 that prioritized revenue generated from new customer acquisitions over existing customers, thereby incentivizing the sales team to focus their efforts on new customer growth. Historically, new customers only accounted for less than 10% of the Company’s revenue derived from the use of its platform. The Company’s Q1 2024 Quarterly Report also discussed the risk of existing customers, especially the Company’s largest customers, decreasing their use of the Company’s platform as hypothetical risks when, in reality, the risk had already materialized, as existing customers’ use of Fastly’s platform had been stagnating for at least a quarter. The full truth came to light on August 7, 2024, when the Company hosted an earnings call to discuss its Q2 2024 financial results and disclosed that revenue from the Company’s largest customers was continuing to decline and the Company had shifted its focus towards new customer acquisitions in order to diversify and mitigate the Company’s dependence on its largest customers. Fastly’s top 10 customers’ revenue share had fallen from 40% to 34% in two quarters. Analysts reacted negatively. For instance, on August 7, 2024, Piper Sandler noted there was now “likely lack of management credibility for at least the next few quarters” (emphasis added). In an August 8, 2024 report, Craig-Hallum Capital noted that “[t]he team did make it clear that the decline was not in the whole top 10, but a ‘small handful’ of the top 10 in the media vertical. This would seem to imply declines of major magnitude at those customers, something on the order of halving revenue at those three or four customers.” (emphasis added). It added, “[t]here will be questions around management’s visibility after this surprise” and “FSLY is bleeding badly when it comes to large customers and is providing very little visibility. . . . [I[nvestors are going to need more information” (emphasis added). Following these developments, Fastly’s stock price fell $0.98 per share, or 14.33%, to close at $5.86 per share on August 8, 2024. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiffs and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.",

      "summary": "This case concerns the alleged misrepresentations made by defendants Vicor Corporation and its CEO, Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli (collectively, “Vicor”), during a July 25, 2023, earnings call. Vicor is a company that manufactures power components, and its stock is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In the year leading up to the earnings call, Vicor’s two largest customers, Nvidia and Google, stopped using Vicor’s power designs or components. As a result, Vicor’s stock declined, and its order backlog shrank. Plaintiffs, a group of short sellers, believed that Vicor was overvalued. They took short positions in Vicor’s stock between May and July 2023. Following the July 25, 2023, earnings call, Vicor’s stock price and trading volume increased. According to plaintiffs, Vicor’s statements during the call led the market to believe that Vicor had a new partnership deal with Nvidia or Google. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the price increase, they were forced to cover their short positions at a significant loss. On October 24, 2023, Vicor held another earnings call. During this call, Vicor allegedly retreated from its prior statement and denied ever having made the representation about the customer. Following this call, Vicor’s stock price declined. Plaintiffs assert that this corrective disclosure made clear that the July 25, 2023, announcement was false when made. On September 3, 2024, after this lawsuit was filed, Vicor issued a press release. In the press release, Vicor stated that its July 25, 2023, announcement was true because it had just booked $30 million in non-cancellable, non-returnable orders from the customer. Plaintiffs assert that the press release confounds more than it explains. Plaintiffs bring claims against Vicor for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and against Vinciarelli for violations of Section 20 of the Exchange Act. Vicor moves to dismiss both claims. For the following reasons, the court grants Vicor’s motion to dismiss.",

      "summary": "SunPower is a solar energy company that sells solar energy generation, storage, and use products and services in the United States and Canada. The company’s products are used in what is called the downstream “Distributed Generation” or “DG” residential and commercial markets. In 2020, SunPower divested its manufacturing business, Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (“Maxeon”), which continued through the Class Period to be SunPower’s exclusive supplier of solar panels. SunPower’s business was divided into three main segments: Residential, Light Commercial (“RLC”); Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”); and “Others.” The “light commercial” portion of SunPower’s RLC business is referred to as “Light Commercial Value-Added Reseller” or “CVAR.” For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the company reported $1.125 billion in total revenue, approximately $848 million of which was generated from the RLC segment and $255 million of which was generated from CIS. Defendant Faricy became CEO, President and a member of SunPower’s Board of Directors on April 19, 2021. Defendant Sial was at all relevant times Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of SunPower. On August 3, 2021, SunPower issued a press release announcing its 2Q21 financial results. The press release quoted Faricy as stating: “‘Our solid second quarter results reflect continued execution in both our residential and commercial businesses . . . .’” That day, the company also held an earnings call to discuss the 2Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Sial stated: “[O]n the CIS side of the house . . . the business has got a mix of projects, and we are seeing some of those projects move into 2022. . . . We knew that [there would be] lumpiness in the commercial business. . . . I think the business is significantly better year-on-year, both from a top line perspective as well as a margin point of view. And then more importantly, we expect the CIS business to be profitable in the back half of the year, which you recall is a significant turnaround from the last couple of years.” On August 4, 2021, SunPower filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for 2Q21. Under “Risk Factors,” the report warned: “The failure of a supplier to supply raw materials or components in a timely manner, or to supply raw materials or components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers within required time frames.” The 2Q21 Form 10-Q also incorporated by reference the risk factors disclosed in the company’s annual report for FY20 (ended January 3, 2021), which included the following statements: “If we have quality issues with our solar and related products, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed. . . . [D]efects could cause us to incur significant warranty, non-warranty, and re-engineering costs, which may not be covered by manufacturer warranties, and could significantly affect our customer relations and business reputation. If we deliver products with errors or defects, or if there is a perception that such products contain errors or defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed. In addition, some of our arrangements with customers include termination or put rights for non-performance. In certain limited cases, we could incur liquidated damages or even be required to buy back a customer’s system at fair value on specified future dates if certain minimum performance thresholds are not met.” “While we generally pass through to our customers the manufacturer warranties we receive from our suppliers, in some circumstances, we may be responsible for repairing or replacing defective parts during our warranty period, often including those covered by manufacturers’ warranties, or incur other non-warranty costs. If a manufacturer disputes or otherwise fails to honor its warranty obligations, we may be required to incur substantial costs before we are compensated, if at all, by the manufacturer. . . . Increases in the defect rate of SunPower or third-party products, including components, could cause us to increase the amount of warranty reserves and have a corresponding material, negative impact on our results of operations. Further, potential future product or component failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products or components, and we have agreed in some circumstances to indemnify our customers and our distributors against liability from some defects in our solar products. A successful indemnification claim against us could require us to make significant damage payments. Repair and replacement costs, as well as successful indemnification claims, could materially and negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. . . . In addition, quality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.” On October 5, 2021, SunPower held a conference call for analysts and investors, purportedly to discuss the company’s acquisition of another residential solar power provider, Blue Raven Solar LLC. However, during the call, defendants also made statements unrelated to Blue Raven, including that the company was revising its guidance downward due to poor performance in the CIS segment and that SunPower was exploring options for that same CIS segment. Defendants’ statements also signaled how far along defendants already were in reviewing the CIS segment for a sale, as Faricy told investors “we’re looking to complete the process by the end of the calendar year.” In describing these disclosures, defendants stated that the CIS business was a “point of strength” and “very healthy.” On November 3, 2021, SunPower issued a press release announcing its 3Q21 financial results. The press release quoted Sial as stating: “Commercial & Industrial Solutions (CIS) business also had strong bookings for the third quarter. Our cash position is strong.” That day, the company also held an earnings call to discuss the 3Q21 financial results and guidance. During the call, Faricy stated: “Over the past few years, you’ve been with us through several major restructuring events and strategic changes. I’m pleased to report we have found our footing. With a streamlined company and our healthiest balance sheet in years, we are now going on offense to grow our business across a vast, mostly untapped residential TAM.” On November 4, 2021, SunPower filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for 3Q21. The 3Q21 quarterly repeated and incorporated by reference the same statements made in the 2Q21 quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q. On December 7, 2021, SunPower published to its website the latest edition of its manual for Safety and Installation Instructions for the United States and Canada. The manual contained newly added language concerning cracking in connectors not present in the 2019 or 2020 editions of the United States and Canada manual. The latest published manual, for example, newly warned “[d]o not allow the connectors to come in contact with chemicals such as greases, oils and organic solvents which may cause stress cracking” and “[c]onnectors are factory assembled with intentional gaps between the cable nut and the body of the connector. Do not retighten module connector nuts as this may lead to stress cracking of the connector assembly and will void the warranty.” In addition, the December 7, 2022 manual added new advisories concerning best practices for safely handling connectors: “[f]or connectors, which are accessible to untrained people, it is imperative to use the locking connectors and safety clips, if applicable, in order to defend against untrained personnel disconnecting the modules once they have been installed”; and to “[a]void exposure of electrical connections to direct sunlight and do not place the connector in a location where water could easily accumulate.” On January 20, 2022, after market hours, SunPower issued a press release on Form 8-K announcing that the company would miss its financial guidance due to “cracking” problems with products across its commercial businesses. The release noted that the problems had developed “over time” and in both the CVAR and CIS commercial segments, and that SunPower, no doubt in response, had hired a new executive to oversee the company’s supply chain. The press release stated in relevant part: SAN JOSE, Calif. (January 20, 2022) – SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ:SPWR), a leading solar technology and energy services provider, today announced it is taking proactive measures to enhance customer care by replacing certain third-party connectors within its Light Commercial Value-Added Reseller (CVAR) and Commercial & Industrial Solutions (CIS) systems. Through a product quality assessment, the company has identified a cracking issue that developed over time in certain factory-installed connectors within third-party commercial equipment supplied to SunPower. There have been no reported safety incidents attributed to this issue, nor has there been any degradation of performance. Nevertheless, to avoid potential longer-term complications and ensure an excellent lifetime customer experience, SunPower is proactively replacing all of these connectors. The company plans to replace the connectors in impacted equipment largely during 2022. . . . SunPower expects approximately $27 million of supplier-quality related charges in fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 as it pursues recovery of costs from the suppliers. . . . GAAP Revenue for fourth quarter 2021 is expected to fall within the previously guided range of $361 to $421 million. Excluding the charge, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA results are expected to be at the low end of SunPower’s previously disclosed guidance range of $18 to $41 million. Factors affecting fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA include approximately $6.5 million of Residential EBITDA effectively pushed into 2022 as the result of weather in California and COVID impacts. Another $3 million was invested in sales and marketing to rapidly expand SunPower’s serviceable solar market to more customers in underpenetrated areas nationally. In response to the aftermarket January 20, 2022 disclosures, SunPower’s stock price declined from a close of $19.02 on January 20, 2022, to $15.80 on January 21, 2022, a 16.9% drop, on more than 11.4 million shares trading volume as compared to only 2.8 million shares traded on January 20, 2022.",

      "summary": "This case concerns the FDA’s rejection of ImmunityBio’s application to license a new biopharmaceutical for the treatment of bladder cancer. The FDA rejected the application after a pre-license inspection of the manufacturing facilities ImmunityBio used to produce the drug. The FDA found that the facilities failed to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), a set of minimum procedures and practices that companies must follow to ensure that the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs is well-controlled. The FDA classifies such a result as “Official Action Indicated” (“OAI”), the most severe classification. The FDA’s internal guidelines provide that an OAI classification will result in a “withhold” recommendation on any pending application, which “ensures the product cannot be marketed in the United States until a follow-up inspection verifies implementation.” The FDA rejected ImmunityBio’s application on May 9, 2023. ImmunityBio announced the rejection in a Form 8-K on May 11, 2023. ImmunityBio’s stock price fell 55% that day. Dipak Patel, the lead plaintiff in this case, alleges that ImmunityBio and its three top executives made false and misleading statements about the company’s manufacturing capabilities, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Patel alleges that the defendants failed to disclose that the facilities ImmunityBio used to produce the drug in question suffered from a collection of serious and recurring cGMP failings, and that those failings were not remediated and thus allowed to continue. Patel alleges that the defendants made the following types of false and misleading statements: (1) statements touting ImmunityBio’s manufacturing capabilities and cGMP compliance; (2) statements warning about hypothetical risks that could occur if ImmunityBio failed to comply with cGMP and/or failed to pass a pre-license inspection; and (3) statements about the status of ImmunityBio’s application to license the drug. ImmunityBio moved to dismiss Patel’s complaint for failure to state a claim. The Court granted ImmunityBio’s motion and dismissed the complaint for failure to plead scienter. Section 10(b) makes it unlawful to “use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.” Rule 10b-5 prohibits “mak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact or . . . omit[ting] to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.” To state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must plead (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. When a plaintiff alleges a material misrepresentation or omission, the plaintiff must plead the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity. To plead scienter, a plaintiff must allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness. The inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable – it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent. Courts must consider the complaint in its entirety and weigh all competing inferences of scienter. The Court’s order dismissing Patel’s complaint reasoned that Patel failed to plead scienter because he failed to allege that ImmunityBio’s executives had actual knowledge of cGMP failings at the manufacturing facilities. The Court concluded that Patel’s allegations that the executives had access to information about the cGMP failings were insufficient to establish scienter. The Court also considered and rejected the competing inference that the executives believed that the cGMP failings were resolved by the time of the FDA’s pre-license inspection. The Court explained that, even if the executives knew about the cGMP failings, there was no indication that they knew about the ongoing cGMP failings at the time of the inspection. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their motive to obtain FDA approval for the drug. The Court explained that the desire to obtain FDA approval for a new drug is a common motive for any pharmaceutical company and therefore does not support a strong inference of scienter. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their contemporaneous statements about the importance of cGMP compliance. The Court explained that such statements were generic and did not indicate that the executives knew about the cGMP failings at the manufacturing facilities. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their refusal to correct the alleged misstatements after the FDA’s rejection of the application. The Court explained that the executives’ refusal to correct the alleged misstatements was consistent with their belief that the cGMP failings were resolved by the time of the inspection. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their decision to build a new manufacturing facility. The Court explained that the decision to build a new facility could be motivated by a variety of reasons and did not necessarily indicate knowledge of the cGMP failings. Finally, the Court rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their position as top executives of the company. The Court explained that allegations of corporate management’s general awareness of the day-to-day workings of the company’s business do not establish scienter. The Court dismissed Patel’s Section 20(a) claim because it is derivative of his Section 10(b) claim. The Court granted Patel leave to amend his complaint to add allegations of scienter. Patel filed an amended complaint, which ImmunityBio again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Court granted ImmunityBio’s motion and dismissed the amended complaint for failure to plead scienter. The Court’s order dismissing the amended complaint reasoned that Patel again failed to plead scienter because he failed to allege that ImmunityBio’s executives had actual knowledge of cGMP failings at the manufacturing facilities. The Court explained that Patel’s new allegations about the executives’ involvement in the manufacturing process were insufficient to establish scienter because they did not show that the executives knew about the ongoing cGMP failings at the time of the FDA’s pre-license inspection. The Court also considered and rejected the competing inference that the executives believed that the cGMP failings were resolved by the time of the inspection. The Court explained that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings before the inspection did not establish scienter because there was no indication that they knew about the ongoing cGMP failings at the time of the inspection. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their decision to build a new manufacturing facility. The Court explained that the decision to build a new facility could be motivated by a variety of reasons and did not necessarily indicate knowledge of the cGMP failings. The Court also rejected Patel’s argument that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings could be inferred from their position as top executives of the company. The Court explained that allegations of corporate management’s general awareness of the day-to-day workings of the company’s business do not establish scienter. The Court dismissed Patel’s Section 20(a) claim because it is derivative of his Section 10(b) claim. The Court denied Patel leave to amend his complaint on the ground that amendment would be futile. Patel filed a notice of appeal from the Court’s order dismissing the amended complaint. The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction over Patel’s appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The Ninth Circuit reviews the district court’s dismissal of the amended complaint de novo. The Ninth Circuit must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. The Ninth Circuit must affirm the district court’s dismissal if the complaint fails to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. The Ninth Circuit must also affirm the district court’s denial of leave to amend if amendment would be futile. To state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must plead (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. When a plaintiff alleges a material misrepresentation or omission, the plaintiff must plead the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity. To plead scienter, a plaintiff must allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness. The inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable – it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.

Patel’s amended complaint alleges that ImmunityBio and its three top executives made false and misleading statements about the company’s manufacturing capabilities, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Patel’s amended complaint includes new allegations about the executives’ involvement in the manufacturing process. Patel alleges that the executives were aware of the cGMP failings at the manufacturing facilities because they were involved in monthly meetings with the facilities’ management, conducted a mock inspection of the facilities, and received daily updates about the FDA’s pre-license inspection. Patel also alleges that the executives’ knowledge of the cGMP failings can be inferred from their decision to build a new manufacturing facility and their position as top executives of the company. The Court concludes that Patel’s amended complaint fails to plead scienter because it fails to allege that the executives had actual knowledge of cGMP failings at the manufacturing facilities at the time of the FDA’s pre-license inspection. The Court explains that the executives’ knowledge of cGMP failings before the inspection does not establish scienter because there is no indication that they knew about the ongoing cGMP failings at the time of the inspection. The Court also explains that the executives’ decision to build a new manufacturing facility and their position as top executives of the company do not establish scienter. The Court dismisses Patel’s Section 20(a) claim because it is derivative of his Section 10(b) claim. The Court denies Patel leave to amend his complaint on the ground that amendment would be futile. The Ninth Circuit affirms the district court’s dismissal of Patel’s amended complaint and denial of leave to amend.",

      "summary": "This case involves fraudulent accounting treatment of approximately $2.2 million in shipping expenses that led to materially misleading financial statements being filed with the Commission and made available to the investing public. Furniture retailer and publicly traded company (sometimes referred to as an “issuer” of securities) Lovesac, its former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Executive Vice President, Donna Dellomo, and its former Controller and Vice President, Yoon Um, failed to properly account for “last mile” shipping expenses, i.e., the cost of shipping finished products from Lovesac’s distribution centers to its customers. Dellomo and Um instead engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obscure the expenses in the company’s books and records. In April 2023, Lovesac discovered that $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses were not properly recorded and reported in its previously published financial results for the periods in which they were incurred. The $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses had instead been inaccurately recorded in the Company’s books and records for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Um, in concert with Dellomo, engaged in a scheme to hide those expenses from investors and the Commission. They did this to avoid missing Lovesac’s projected gross margin—an important financial metric that the Company disclosed in its SEC filings and on conference calls that are open to investors where the Company discusses financial and other issues (often referred to as “earnings calls,” which are frequently attended by financial analysts covering the Company)—and to avoid restating the Company’s prior financial filings for the periods in which the expenses were incurred. To accomplish this scheme, Dellomo and Um improperly accounted for the expenses. Dellomo and Um, both experienced financial professionals and certified public accountants (“CPA”), knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the fraudulent accounting treatment they devised was not compliant with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and rendered certain of Lovesac’s financial statements materially false and misleading. As part of the scheme, Dellomo also submitted a false and misleading management representation letter to Lovesac’s outside auditor and otherwise failed to alert Lovesac’s auditors to the fraudulent accounting for the $2.2 million in last mile shipping expenses. Further, Lovesac and Dellomo failed to implement sufficient internal controls over financial reporting—that is, processes, policies and procedures put in place by a company to provide reasonable assurances as to the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of its financial reporting—that may have prevented or detected Dellomo and Um’s fraudulent accounting. In the end, Lovesac was required to restate its financial statements for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to correct Dellomo and Um’s fraud. As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Lovesac violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Dellomo violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, thereunder. Dellomo also aided and abetted Lovesac’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Um violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder. Um also aided and abetted Dellomo’s violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and Lovesac’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.",

      "summary": "Danaher is a conglomerate that designs, manufactures, and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services worldwide. Danaher’s three reporting segments are Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Diagnostics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Danaher’s diagnostic tests and life sciences equipment were widely used in the effort to combat COVID-19. Danaher’s diagnostics segment included Cepheid, a leader in molecular testing, and its life sciences segment included several companies that provided products and services, including sophisticated lab-grade equipment, used by customers to develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Danaher experienced explosive revenue growth during this period, and its stock price nearly tripled, reaching an all-time high of $332.43 per share on September 3, 2021. The population at large began to accept COVID-19 as an endemic disease, and the biopharmaceutical industry tempered its pursuit of COVID-related projects. In addition, large pharmaceutical customers continued to receive equipment in response to orders placed months earlier during the peak of the pandemic due to the extensive lead times caused by the global supply chain disruption. But having just emerged from a supply crisis, these customers decided to stockpile this inventory rather than cancel the orders in order to put the equipment toward other projects and, effectively, prevent the need to place orders in the future. In addition, smaller startups in early-stage development which traditionally relied on external sources to fund their projects no longer had the same access to funding that they did during the pandemic as interest rates rose, and began to prioritize projects in order to conserve cash. Collectively, these developments had a catastrophic impact on the bioprocessing business, particularly as they sustained through 2022 and 2023. Danaher’s bioprocessing business is the arm responsible for manufactured equipment and components used by biopharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and other therapeutics. By the start of 2022, this single business division had grown to become a $7.5 billion franchise. Plaintiffs are investors who purchased Danaher’s securities during the Class Period. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made a series of materially false or misleading statements during the Class Period. Plaintiffs contend that these statements were materially false and misleading because they lacked a reasonable basis insofar as they were untethered to ongoing customer activity and market conditions which posed a significant threat to the continued growth of Danaher’s bioprocessing business in 2022, including, among other things, that: (i) revenues associated with products used to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics to treat COVID-19 would materially decline as customers moved away from those product candidates to pursue other projects as the disease entered an endemic state; (ii) contrary to the Company’s representations, revenues from products and services unassociated with COVID-19 businesses were insufficient to compensate for the foregoing downturn in business because they too were subsiding for several reasons; and (iii) accordingly, Danaher would be unable to sustain its growth in 2022. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants made a series of materially false and misleading statements about the growth of Danaher’s bioprocessing business in 2022 and 2023. Plaintiffs contend that these statements were materially false and misleading because they lacked a reasonable basis insofar as they were untethered to ongoing customer activity and market conditions which posed a significant threat to the continued growth of Danaher’s bioprocessing business in 2022 or 2023, including, among other things, that: (i) revenues associated with products used to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics to treat COVID-19 would materially decline as customers moved away from those product candidates to pursue other projects as the disease entered an endemic state; (ii) large pharmaceutical customers had stockpiled inventory in the aftermath of the pandemic and were relying those items to satisfy new projects instead of placing new orders; (iii) smaller early-stage biotechnology customers no longer had the same access to external funding that they once did during the COVID-19 pandemic and, as such, began to prioritize projects in order to conserve their cash; (iv) as such, contrary to the Company’s representations, revenues from products and services unassociated with COVID-19 businesses were insufficient to compensate for the foregoing downturn in business in 2022 and would continue to decline in 2023; and (v) accordingly, Danaher would be unable to sustain its growth in and 2023.

      "summary": "Focus was a publicly traded company in the RIA sector. In the summer of 2022, Focus’s Board began exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. At the time, Stone Point owned approximately 20.6% of Focus’s equity and voting power, making it the company’s single largest shareholder. Stone Point also enjoyed additional levers of influence over Focus. Stone Point had nominated two directors to the Board, which gave it direct control over at least four of the eight Board members. Stone Point also had de facto control over all significant decisions concerning compensation of Focus’s senior executives, including the CEO and COO, both of whom were also Board members. And Stone Point exercised significant power in the context of negotiations concerning any merger or acquisition through a credit agreement between Focus and its lenders. Stone Point also had a keen interest in a sale of Focus because it, along with the Officer Defendants and all Board members other than Stone Point’s two nominees, had the right to receive significant payments under tax receivable agreements (“TRAs”) previously executed with the company. The TRAs provided that Stone Point and the other TRA holders would be entitled to an early termination payment if Focus were sold, calculated by using the present value of future tax savings payable under the TRAs. The TRAs also provided that, in a change of control transaction involving Focus, the company’s payment obligations under the TRAs would accelerate and become payable in a lump-sum payment due at the time of the merger. From the outset, the Board and its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, were determined to pursue only private equity buyers. CD&R, a private equity firm, was quickly identified as a viable candidate. The Board decided to decline CD&R’s initial $50 per share bid, but authorized company management to continue negotiating with CD&R and to provide CD&R additional due diligence for a potential transaction. Consistent with the Board’s decision to grant CD&R additional due diligence, CD&R representatives were provided access to a virtual data room containing additional non-public information. CD&R was the only potential buyer given access to Focus’s virtual data room in advance of the “go-shop” period for merger negotiations. After receiving data room access, CD&R representatives met in person with members of Focus management for a full-day due diligence meeting. Additional due diligence meetings between Focus management and CD&R representatives were held over the next few weeks. These meetings and the extensive due diligence provided to CD&R all occurred before the Special Committee’s November 1, 2022 formation. In total, CD&R met at least eleven times with members of the Focus management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Jefferies, which was later brought in as a second financial advisor, during the sale process. CD&R also met three times with Stone Point to discuss a transaction and Stone Point’s equity rollover. The Board and Special Committee did not contact potential strategic acquirors during this period. In many instances, this was because company management, Goldman Sachs, or Jefferies discouraged consideration of strategic acquirors by the Special Committee and Board. Adolf himself avoided meetings with strategic parties, as such buyers would likely jettison Focus’s existing management team. Indeed, while Adolf was initially introduced to the CEO of a strategic acquiror, he avoided a follow-up meeting for months. When Adolf finally met with the CEO, the CEO informed Adolf that the company had a concrete interest in engaging in a “transformative transaction” with Focus. At a Special Committee meeting on January 4, 2023, Jefferies discouraged consideration of another strategic acquiror, warning that the committee should be cautious with respect to a potential bid from the company because it would need to engage in a significant amount of due diligence work to be in the same position as CD&R, that the company likely had significant financing considerations that it would need to address in any potential acquisition of Focus, and that there were additional issues, such as who would manage the pro forma entity, that would need to be addressed as part of any agreement reached with the company in respect of a potential acquisition of Focus. At the Special Committee meeting on January 6, 2023, Jefferies further reported that company management’s meeting with another strategic competitor of the company had gone well but that such a transaction would face significant complexity. By contrast, CD&R signaled its intention to maintain Focus’s executive management team early in negotiations. In fact, CD&R’s position was consistent with its overall investment strategy of partnering with the founders and management teams of the companies it acquires. The Board and management negotiated with CD&R for months. While this was occurring, the Special Committee asked its financial advisors to conduct a limited outreach to potential third-party bidders, including the strategic acquiror whose CEO had previously expressed a concrete interest in engaging in a “transformative transaction” with Focus. The strategic acquiror quickly made an offer. The Special Committee’s legal counsel advised that a strategic buyer may be able to offer more value to Focus shareholders. However, the Special Committee withheld additional due diligence information from the strategic acquiror and agreed to only provide such information and entertain additional transaction discussions with the strategic acquiror if it submitted a proposal at $55 per share. In contrast, Defendants had willingly provided due diligence to CD&R when their bid was just $50.00 per share. The strategic acquiror met that challenge on January 22, 2023. That day, the strategic acquiror offered to purchase Focus for $55 per share, contingent on additional due diligence, obtaining financing, and receiving exclusivity from Focus. Instead of engaging with the strategic acquiror, the Special Committee decided to grant CD&R exclusivity following its lower $53.00 bid on January 29, 2023. Focus and CD&R executed an exclusivity agreement on January 30, 2023, which ran through February 20, 2023 and was later extended to February 26, 2023—effectively freezing out the strategic acquiror from meaningful participation in the remainder of the sale process despite its expressed interest in doing so at a higher price. On February 27, 2023, Focus issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by CD&R. In touting the merger, the Focus press release also claimed the transaction results from a robust process conducted by a Special Committee, that the Special Committee is composed entirely of independent and disinterested directors, and that the Special Committee of the Board of Directors has unanimously determined that this transaction is fair to and in the best interests of Focus and its unaffiliated shareholders. On April 25, 2023, Focus filed a preliminary proxy relating to the merger. Focus filed the definitive proxy on June 12, 2023 to solicit a shareholder vote on the merger. The shareholder vote was scheduled for July 14, 2023. On July 6, 2023, over seventy days after Focus filed the preliminary proxy statement—and just six business days before the shareholder vote—Defendants issued a supplemental proxy which revealed significant and serious conflicts of interest plaguing the merger process. The supplemental proxy revealed the more than $130 million in TRA payments, which influenced the Board, Officer Defendants and the members of the Special Committee to favor the merger over the status quo. The supplemental proxy also revealed conflicts harbored by the purportedly disinterested and independent members of the Special Committee. Six business days after issuance of the supplemental proxy, the merger achieved the necessary votes to approve the merger at a special meeting on July 14, 2023. The merger closed on August 31, 2023, with Focus Class A common shareholders receiving $53 per share in cash as merger consideration.",

      "summary": "I will grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The PSLRA requires that plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with intent to deceive or with reckless disregard for the truth. The PSLRA’s heightened pleading standard requires that “the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.” This “strong inference” of scienter is not satisfied by conclusory allegations that a defendant “knew or should have known” of allegedly false or misleading statements. Nor is a strong inference of scienter satisfied by “allegations that a defendant merely ought to have known that the statements were inaccurate.” Additionally, an inference of scienter is not strong where the complaint “relies on allegations that amount to fraud by hindsight.” The PSLRA also “requires plaintiffs to specify the role of each defendant, demonstrating each defendant’s involvement in misstatements and omissions.” “Generalized imputations of knowledge do not suffice, regardless of the defendants’ positions within the company.” Investors’ complaint lacks any particularized allegation that Defendants McMillon or Biggs had actual knowledge of the falsity of any of Walmart’s statements at the time they were made. The closest the complaint comes is to allege that McMillon was personally involved in Walmart’s response to the DOJ’s criminal investigation. But even if that is true, it does not give rise to a strong inference that McMillon knew that Walmart had violated the CSA (and thus that Walmart’s disclosures were false or misleading). The complaint does not allege that McMillon ever admitted or was told that Walmart had violated the CSA. The complaint also fails to allege facts that would give rise to a strong inference of scienter under a “core operations” theory. The complaint’s allegations that Defendants received notices of CSA violations do not show that Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that Walmart’s statements were false or misleading. The complaint does not allege that Defendants ever received a notice that Walmart was violating the CSA during the class period. The complaint’s allegations that Defendants made “false exculpatory statements” and withheld evidence from the MDL court do not support a strong inference of scienter. The complaint’s allegations that Defendants hired Rachel Brand, a former DOJ official, to help influence the DOJ’s investigation and that Defendants had a motive to drive sales by attracting customers to Walmart who filled prescriptions for opioids do not support a strong inference of scienter. The complaint does not allege that Defendants’ statements to the investing public were false or misleading, and Investors have failed to plead scienter with the required particularity.",

In the registration statement, GoHealth emphasized that its shift to Medicare enabled the company to capitalize on “strong demographic trends,” as Medicare enrollment was expected to grow from approximately 61 million individuals in 2019 to approximately 77 million individuals by 2028, with 10,000 plus Americans turning 65 every day, and with an increasing proportion of Medicare-eligible individuals choosing commercial insurance solutions by enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans instead of basic Medicare. In the registration statement, GoHealth described itself as primed to disrupt the traditional field agent-driven sales process for insurance, and specifically for Medicare, by using its digitally enabled and technology-driven marketplace. Consumers using GoHealth to shop for insurance do not pay any fees for access to the company’s platform or for enrollment or other services. Rather, GoHealth is typically paid an initial commission by health insurance carriers when consumers enroll in carriers’ products and become customers, and additional recurring commissions as long as those customers retain their health insurance plans. Therefore, customer “persistency” – i.e., customers staying enrolled in their health insurance plans – was necessary to counter “churn,” an industry term used to describe customers who drop from one insurance company’s plan in favor of a competitor’s plan. The registration statement touted GoHealth’s “strong” relationships with leading insurance carriers and its 19-year track record of “industry-leading” growth, pointing to a 52% compound annual growth rate between 2003 and 2019. The financial information included in the registration statement demonstrated GoHealth’s rapid growth leading up to the IPO. For example, the registration statement stated that GoHealth’s total commissions receivable, which represented expected future commission streams, was $388.8 million as of the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (“1Q2020”), an increase of 223.4% compared to the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 (“1Q2019”). In 1Q2020, the Medicare segments generated 89% of the company’s revenues, with the Medicare-internal segment accounting for 68% of GoHealth’s total revenues and the Medicare-external segment accounting for 21% of total revenues. Within the Medicare segments, Medicare Advantage products generate the majority of net revenues, accounting for 75% of net revenues for the Medicare-internal segment and 95% of net revenues for the Medicare-external segment during 1Q2020. Although the company’s important Medicare-internal segment, which focused on Medicare Advantage plans, generated the lion’s share of GoHealth’s revenues and drove GoHealth’s overall financial performance, it was concentrated heavily on just two insurance carrier customers: Humana, Inc. and Anthem, Inc. In 2019, Humana and Anthem accounted for 40% and 20%, respectively, of the company’s total revenues. In 1Q2020, Humana and Anthem collectively accounted for 74% of the company’s total revenues, up from 43% in 1Q2019. The registration statement stated that GoHealth’s key financial metric, a ratio that GoHealth calls “LTV/CAC,” was first among its peers. LTV/CAC is a shorthand description that divides the lifetime value of commissions that GoHealth estimated it would receive per “approved submission” (“LTV”) by the cost to convert a prospective customer into an actual one that signs up for an insurance policy with a carrier (“CAC”). As a result, LTV/CAC is a measure of the company’s commissions relative to its customer acquisition cost. Despite being a critical metric to the company’s financial performance, the complexity of GoHealth’s LTV/CAC made it impossible for investors to understand exactly how it was calculated for one period versus another or to calculate it for themselves. For example, the company defined LTV/CAC in the registration statement as follows: “LTV/CAC” refers to the Lifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost, which we define as (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable approved submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a prospect into a customer less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less other revenue and is presented on a per commissionable approved submission basis. Many of the metrics that went into GoHealth’s LTV/CAC were not reported individually, turning GoHealth’s critical financial metric into a veritable black box. Despite this, it is clear that GoHealth uses real-time data to continuously analyze and understand the day-to-day financial performance of its operations, including how those fluctuations impact GoHealth’s LTV/CAC. For example, the company repeatedly emphasized as a main selling point to investors that GoHealth, in real time, collects data on all aspects of its business and various financial performance metrics. The company uses advanced statistical models to calculate and predict LTV/CAC and the profitability and conversion probability of consumer leads, as well as future commission streams associated with each consumer enrolled in each specific plan product, all of which the company uses to determine its total commissions receivable. With GoHealth’s eye-popping growth, swelling revenues, and industry-leading LTV/CAC, there was significant demand in anticipation of the IPO. On June 19, 2020, GoHealth filed a draft registration statement with the SEC on Form S-1. The registration statement was amended by a filing on July 8, 2020, which stated the IPO would consist of 39.5 million shares at an offering price of $19.00 per share. Then, on July 14, 2020, GoHealth increased the size of the offering by 4.6 million shares, bringing the total offering to 44.5 million shares. Two weeks after the close of the second quarter of 2020 (“2Q2020”), on July 14, 2020, GoHealth priced the IPO at $21.00 per share and filed the final prospectus for the IPO, which forms part of the registration statement. By July 17, 2020, GoHealth completed the IPO, selling 44.5 million shares at $21.00 per share, generating over $913,500,000 in gross proceeds. The registration statement, in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act, contained materially false statements, omitted statements necessary to make the statements made in the registration statement not misleading, and failed to disclose information that was required to be disclosed therein. Specifically, unbeknownst to investors, because it was not disclosed in the registration statement, GoHealth was suffering heightened customer churn at the time of the IPO. In addition, GoHealth had reached the limits of the growth that could be achieved under its existing business model, and as a result, was required to radically depart from its business strategy leading up to the IPO in order to continue generating rapid revenue growth. To make this necessary change, the company and its senior executives and officers planned to make 2020 an “investment year” for the company, in which GoHealth would significantly and rapidly expand its insurance carrier customer base for Medicare. These plans created negative pressure on the company’s critical LTV/CAC metric by, among other things: (a) lowering commission rates on approved submissions; (b) significantly increasing marketing expenses; (c) impairing persistency and generating a corresponding increase in customer churn, or, at a minimum, requiring GoHealth to increase its efforts (and costs) to combat churn; and (d) reducing GoHealth’s commissionable revenue in favor of increased non-commissionable revenue, which also dragged down GoHealth’s LTV and resulted in decreased persistency. GoHealth’s planned, but not disclosed, altering of its business strategy was necessary because, prior to and at the time of the IPO, the company had relied heavily on just two Medicare carrier customers: Humana and Anthem. The company had effectively maximized the growth that could be achieved by continuing to rely on these two carriers. Thus, in order to continue increasing its financial performance at the rate investors expected at the time of the IPO, GoHealth needed to route increasing numbers of Medicare-eligible consumers to a greater variety of insurance carriers while simultaneously expanding into new geographies. As a result, GoHealth needed to rapidly expand its base of insurance carrier customers. Rather than reading about GoHealth’s planned “investment year” in the registration statement as was required, investors learned of it in a series of post-IPO events. On August 19, 2020, GoHealth reported its financial results for 2Q2020 ended June 30, 2020, which closed two weeks before the IPO. During an after-hours conference call to discuss GoHealth’s 2Q2020 financial results and outlook, investors learned that GoHealth had added and was adding many new carriers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Kaiser, and “some other regional” Blue Cross Blue Shield providers as the company “look[ed] towards 2021.” Investors also learned that when the company added new Medicare insurance carrier customers, there was “an initial ramp-up period for new carriers with forecasted lower LTVs” and that the company’s “strategy to add several new large carriers” was resulting and would continue to result in “lower initial commission rates and LTVs.” The “strategic decision” by the company also included an increased focus on GoHealth promoting and selling Medicare “Special Needs Plans” (“SNPs”), which resulted in non-commissionable “other” revenue, that also created a “near-term drag on [GoHealth’s] average LTV” and resulted in higher disenrollment rates, e.g., churn. When GoHealth reported its third quarter financial results for the period ending September 30, 2020 (“3Q2020”), it not only reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was $0.64 worse than analyst estimates of a loss per share of $0.01, but it again increased its reliance on non-commissionable revenue to the detriment of commissionable revenue, creating more “near-term” drag on the company’s average LTV. The extent to which 2020 was an “investment year” was made clear well after the IPO. On December 2, 2020, investors learned that GoHealth’s plan for 2020 included reduced, lower-than-normal commissions from newly added carriers and LTV compression, with the company not seeing the “upside” until 2021. Specifically, during the Evercore ISI HealthCONx Conference on December 2, 2020, GoHealth’s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Co-Chair of the company’s Board, Clinton P. Jones, stated: So we anticipated 2020 to be an investment year with new carriers. If you think about a new carrier, there’s technology integrations, there’s understanding other compliance and nuances, there’s understanding all the different plan options and plan types and building that out. [Indiscernible] side of things. So there’s a -- and we also -- when you add a new carrier, you’re typically not -- they don’t view you as anybody special, right? They’re going to give you just a normal commission level. You’ve got to prove yourself on volume and quality to move up the ranks. And typically, you’ll see LTV compression there because you don’t have the top commission rates, which we anticipated, we’ve modeled out, and we thought that would happen. As we think about where we’ve gone from a volume standpoint, we quickly rose through the ranks, we’ve proven ourselves, and we think there’s more upside in 2021 from an LTV standpoint with carriers. We also know more about their effectuation rates, rapid disenrollment rates, things we can look at in the reporting because other -- every carrier is reporting is different as well. Following Jones’ statements, GoHealth’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Travis J. Matthiesen added that the company’s plan to add new carriers in 2020 created a “short-term drag on LTV” and that the company would not get to “top-level contracts” with new carriers until “next year,” i.e., 2021. Matthiesen added that “it’s important to understand that new carriers really are a short-term drag on LTV[.]” Despite planning 2020 as an “investment year” prior to the IPO wherein GoHealth would suffer from lowered average LTV, increased reliance on SNPs with a corresponding decrease in commissionable revenue, increased marketing costs, and negative impacts on persistency and churn, these facts were not disclosed in the registration statement. Therefore, the registration statement, which GoHealth and the other defendants used to secure more than $900 million from investors, contained materially false statements of fact and omitted material facts required to be disclosed in order to make the statements in the registration statement not misleading. The price of GoHealth stock has declined from the offering price of $21.00 per share to $13.32 per share on the day this action was commenced, a 36% decline, to an all-time low of $10.05 per share on December 1, 2020, a 52% decline from the offering price. As a result of defendants’ violations of law, investors have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and damages under the Securities Act.",

      "summary": "In the present case, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege scienter under the PSLRA's heightened pleading standard for their Exchange Act claims. The PSLRA requires plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with intent to deceive or with reckless disregard for the truth. The Court noted that conclusory allegations, such as assertions that defendants \"knew or should have known\" certain facts, are insufficient to establish scienter. Additionally, allegations amounting to \"fraud by hindsight\" or speculation about what defendants must have known do not meet the required standard. The Court emphasized that, under the PSLRA, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing the defendant's actual knowledge of falsity at the time the statements were made. General allegations of corporate knowledge or reliance on the core operations doctrine are inadequate without particularized facts about individual defendants' knowledge. The Court also highlighted that if innocent explanations for the defendant's conduct are equally or more plausible than fraudulent intent, the inference of scienter is not strong enough to withstand a motion to dismiss. The Court further clarified that if a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed for failure to plead scienter, any derivative Section 20(a) control person liability claim must also be dismissed. In this case, the Court dismissed the Exchange Act claims with prejudice, indicating that amendment would be futile. The Court allowed the Securities Act claims to proceed, as they require only negligence and not scienter. Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their complaint to conform to the Court's rulings and to add additional allegations related to the Securities Act claims. This decision underscores the stringent scienter pleading requirements under the PSLRA for federal securities fraud claims and the importance of providing particularized facts demonstrating fraudulent intent at the time of the alleged misstatements.",

      "summary": "American is one of the United States’ three largest providers of air transportation for passengers and cargo. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing for passenger airfare against the other two largest providers of airfare—United Airlines and Delta—as well as with low-cost carriers and ultra low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines, respectively. Prior to the Class Period, American traditionally sold airfare and ancillary services to corporate customers through third party distributors who used global distributions systems (“GDSs”), centralized platforms that act as middlemen between travel agencies and airlines. These GDSs relied on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (“EDIFACT”), a universal language for data sharing, to exchange information regarding airfare and ancillary services. This traditional method for distributing airfare and ancillary services is referred to herein as “EDIFACT channels.” Beginning in December 2022 and continuing through Spring of 2024, American made a series of changes to the way it sold airfare and ancillary services to its corporate customers. The Company’s new distribution strategy, coined “Modern Retailing,” aimed to push corporate customers away from booking through EDIFACT channels to booking directly through American’s website, mobile app, or a direct connection with the airline, all of which involved using New Distribution Capability (“NDC”) technology. In theory, changing ticket distribution to an NDC standard could reduce costs paid to GDSs and travel agencies while providing American with more control of the price and presentation of its airfare to its customers. To induce customers to shift to NDC and direct bookings, in April 2023, American removed forty percent of its airfare content from EDIFACT channels and restricted its availability to the Company’s direct and NDC channels. American also implemented changes to booking agreements with travel agencies and corporations who were booking their own travel (either through an in-house corporate travel department, a travel management company (“TMC”), or a travel agency) by reducing the number of incentives those customers previously received for buying American services through EDIFACT channels, in favor of awarding incentives tied to bookings made directly with American or through NDC-enabled channels. From July 2023 through April 2024, Defendants touted the success of their changes to American’s distribution strategy, and issued false earnings guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2024 (“2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance”) that reflected the supposed financial success of their new distribution strategy. Defendants also falsely claimed that they were very encouraged both by third parties’ response to distribution changes and adoption of NDC technology, as well as by corporate customers’ continued demand. For example, speaking of corporate customers, Defendant Raja positively touted “the durability of these customers’ demand” and Defendant Isom stated that “[t]here’s nothing that I see in terms of customer behavior that would suggest that we’re not on the right path.” Defendants continued to echo these claims throughout the Class Period. However, contrary to their public representations, Defendants had no basis for their portrayal of the results from their new distribution strategy, or for their 2Q/Full Year 2024 guidance because American’s distribution strategy changes were driving travel agencies and corporate customers away in droves, and American’s share of business among airlines as a whole was withering. Indeed, confidential witnesses (“CWs”) who were employed by American during the Class Period recounted that American’s relationships with both travel agencies and corporate customers quickly deteriorated after the Company began introducing its distribution changes. For instance, by April 2023, before the Class Period even began, it was clear to CW2 that, as a result of American’s aggressive push towards NDC distribution, agencies and companies were booking fewer flights with American than they had in the past, with some avoiding American entirely. Similarly, CW1 personally “saw share move away swiftly” by TMCs, which predominately cater to business and corporate travelers. This reduction in share became “particularly noticeable” to CW1 in June 2023 and continued thereafter. Similarly, CW1 confirmed that American “lost so much share” of small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) since many were unwilling to stop using agencies. Critically, based on data available to them through American’s SalesLink Insights platform, PRISM reports, and from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) (explained more fully below), Defendants knew that customers were not adopting NDC technology and instead, American was losing market share to competitors. As CW2 explained, by July 2023 bookings from larger agencies declined 15% compared to year-over-year levels, and bookings for corporate accounts were “much lower” than that. CW2 elaborated that PRISM data demonstrated that American’s agency and corporate bookings and percentage of share metrics remained “consistently down” through the end of CW2’s tenure at the end of January Moreover, after the Class Period, Defendants admitted to having known that American’s lagging revenue and “softness in customer bookings” were a direct result of “changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that American knew that these issues existed during the first quarter of 2024 but nevertheless obscured the severity of impacts in hopes that the results would reverse, stating in relevant part: “[W]e identified a deviation in terms of our revenue performance versus some of our large network peers in the first quarter” of 2024. Despite knowing about these materially negative effects of the new strategy on their business,, Defendants continued to knowingly misrepresent American’s sales success throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. Indeed, as late as April 25, 2024 (one month before quarter close), the Individual Defendants were asked point blank during an earnings call to describe American’s performance with “managed corporate travel volume” in relation to competitors who reported market share around “14%, 15%.” Defendants did not demur. Rather, Defendant Raja clearly lied, stating, in pertinent part, and in contradiction to information known “in the first quarter,” that such “revenues are coming back very materially for us” including with regard to “corporate contract and corporate customers[.]” At the same time Defendants issued knowingly false financial guidance and, referring to American’s supposedly positive performance with NDC deployment, stated “that’s implicit in our [falsely high] guide for Q2 and for the year.” Just one month later, on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024, Defendants disclosed the truth when reporting that Defendant Raja would be leaving the Company in June 2024 and that American was significantly reducing its guidance for the second quarter of 2024. During the Bernstein Conference (defined in ¶ 205) on May 29, 2024, Defendant Isom confirmed that American was reducing its second quarter guidance and revealed that the Company was slashing its growth estimates for the full year 2024 “due to the changes that we have made to our sales and distribution strategy.” Defendant Isom further admitted that, with respect to NDC implementation, American “move[d] faster than we should and we didn’t execute well[,]” “used a lot of sticks[,]” and that its “approach [was and] is driving customers away from American.” During the 2024 Bernstein Conference, Defendant Isom also linked Raja’s departure to American driving customers away with the changes to its agency and corporate strategy. Upon this news, American’s stock dropped dramatically, falling from a closing price of $13.44 per share on May 28, 2024 to close at $11.62 per share on May 29, 2024 and resulting in American’s largest single-day drop since June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic decimated travel demand. As Defendant Isom would later admit during the Company’s July 25, 2Q 2024 Earnings Call (defined in ¶ 219) American’s guidance reduction was directly related to the Company’s changes to its distribution strategy—not general air travel market factors. Indeed, American’s competitor, United Airlines, reaffirmed its guidance within minutes of American’s May 28, 2024 announcement—ostensibly at the ready for American’s disclosure of the truth. Analysts reacted swiftly. For instance, in a May 28, 2024 report, Bernstein analysts were surprised by the extent of American’s guidance reduction, stating in relevant part: “[a] significant miss driven in part by close in bookings[,]” i.e., bookings that are made close in time to a flight date (frequently used for corporate fliers), which “puts AAL’s ability to reap the full value of a robust summer flying season in greater doubt” and further attributed the “close in booking weakness … to loss of corporate travel share associated with recent distribution strategy changes (positive read across to DAL/UAL[Delta/United]).” Barclays wrote in a report published on May 30, 2024 that “a relevant contributor to the revenue weakness[]” was American’s NDC strategy during the Class Period, noting that American was now “abandoning its ‘modern retailing approach’ and that the CCO has left.” Barclays further observed “[n]o other airline has followed this path[,]” that “American’s revenue guidance was very out of kilter with peers,” and that “the issue was [American’s] guidance not the reality of the travel market.” Moreover, after the Class Period on July 25, 2024, Defendant Isom disclosed the full impact of American’s disastrous distribution strategy when reporting American’s operating results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. There, Defendant Isom disclosed that, as a result of the Company’s distribution strategy changes, American lost $750 million in revenue during the first half of 2024, and was expected to experience another $750 million impact to revenue for the second half of 2024. Isom further admitted that American had ceded market share from agencies and corporate customers to its competitors during the Class Period and stated that, in an effort to regain that share, American was reversing the changes to its distribution strategy. Defendants’ fraud caused investors to purchase American securities at artificially inflated prices and suffer immense financial harm thereby. Plaintiffs now seek damages individually and on behalf of the Class.",
