The class period runs from March 1, 2022 through March 21, 2024.

          "scienter_analysis": "The complaint adequately pleads scienter through particularized facts showing defendants' actual knowledge of falsity at the time statements were made. Specifically: (1) Multiple former employees (CWs) provided detailed testimony that defendants Mowry, Plants, and others were directly informed of inventory control failures, including that anyone could walk into the warehouse and take parts, that the ERP/SAP system was non-functional, and that inventory counts were wildly inaccurate. CW 1 (executive leadership) explicitly stated these problems were 'known to Mowry.' CW 6 stated Pinapati 'had been told several times about the inventory problems' and that management offices were in the same building as the warehouse. CW 8 explained there was 'almost like there was no oversight' for months after system implementation. (2) These were not one-off conversations but ongoing, repeated communications in executive meetings, town halls, and direct reports to Mowry. (3) Defendants signed SOX 302 and 906 certifications in April 2023 (for 2022 10-K) and May 2023 (for Q1 2023 10-Q) certifying that internal controls were effective and financial statements were accurate—certifications that were demonstrably false when made, as evidenced by the subsequent March 2024 restatements showing $1.2M overstatement in Q1 and $3.6M in Q2. (4) The magnitude of restatement errors (13% reduction in GAAP gross margin in Q1, 7% in Q2; 20.9% increase in operating loss in Q1, 14.1% in Q2) far exceeded the 5% materiality threshold. (5) Defendants' certifications demonstrate they reviewed financial data and had access to the information showing inventory discrepancies. The complaint provides specific, particularized facts rather than conclusory allegations—it details the nature of the control failures, identifies which executives were informed, describes the mechanisms of communication, and shows temporal proximity between knowledge and false certifications. This is not 'fraud by hindsight' but rather proof of actual knowledge of falsity at time of certification."

          "scienter_analysis": "The complaint adequately pleads scienter through particularized facts showing defendants knew the AviClear rollout was failing while representing it as successful. Specifically: (1) Multiple CWs with direct knowledge testified that customers rejected the device, attempted returns, and were dissatisfied. CW 2 (hired to sell AviClear) stated 'some offices were so dissatisfied with AviClear that they tried to send it back' and that 'many of her contacts at doctor's offices informed her that they would not deal with Cutera due to a reputation for poor customer support.' These concerns were communicated to Huffman (VP Sales reporting to Mowry) and through him to Mowry. (2) CW 1 (executive leadership) stated that by Q2-Q3 2022, 'everyone in the company' knew AviClear was struggling and not meeting projections. She personally raised concerns to Mowry, and noted that Karavitis, Seth, and others also raised these concerns to Mowry. (3) Defendants participated in weekly AviClear conference calls (per CW 5) specifically to discuss placement, utilization rates, and revenues—meaning they had direct access to utilization data showing poor performance. (4) On November 30, 2022, when an analyst directly asked Mowry 'Have you seen any customer stop using AviClear?', Mowry responded 'No' and 'we haven't seen that yet'—yet CW 2 explicitly states customers attempted returns. This is not recklessness but knowing falsity. (5) Defendants made repeated statements touting success (August 2022: 'successful launch'; September 2022: 'growing physician adoption'; November 2022: 'widespread interest'; December 2022: direct denial of customer dissatisfaction) while possessing particularized knowledge to the contrary. (6) The Board's April 2023 termination letter explicitly found Mowry 'had not effectively executed the limited commercial rollout' and 'failed to appropriately train and incentivize our sales teams, accurately forecast demand and usage'—demonstrating the Board's contemporaneous view that execution failures were known. (7) Defendants were financially incentivized through the AviClear Incentive Plan (20% of PSU awards tied to device placement by April 2023), creating motive to conceal poor utilization while touting placement numbers. The complaint shows defendants knew the distinction between placements and utilization/revenue-generating usage, yet emphasized placements while concealing utilization failures. This satisfies the PSLRA's requirement of particularized facts creating a strong inference of intent to deceive or severe recklessness."

          "scienter_analysis": "The complaint adequately pleads scienter through particularized facts showing defendants knew Core Capital was being harmed by AviClear resource diversion while representing it as strong. Specifically: (1) CW 1 (executive leadership) confirmed 'the directive to move away from Cutera's core business to focus on AviClear came directly from Mowry and Plants, and was discussed openly in many AviClear meetings.' This shows actual knowledge of the resource allocation decision and its effects. (2) Multiple CWs raised concerns about supply chain and inventory problems to Mowry, including Huffman, Batarseh, Eckerman, Thier, Karavitis, and Sennett. CW 1 stated Mowry 'knew about these problems' and that 'many people raised concerns about supply chain problems...to Mowry.' (3) The Company's own January 9, 2023 disclosure (after Mowry's statements touting Core Capital strength) revealed that Cutera 'took its eye off the ball on the core business' and that sales teams 'spent the majority of time pushing AviClear' causing 'a majority of the revenue shortfall.' Mowry himself later admitted on February 28, 2023 that 'the North American capital team focused its efforts on driving Aviclear bookings and perhaps over-index[ed] some of their efforts.' (4) This admission directly contradicts Mowry's May 10, 2022 statement that investments in key account managers 'will benefit us...with the core business' and August 4, 2022 statement about 'momentum we continue to see in our core business.' (5) CW 4 explained it was 'impossible' for Mowry not to know about delivery delays and customer cancellations because these issues were raised 'by many people, frequently, on company-wide townhall Zoom meetings where upper management was present,' including Mowry himself. (6) The timing is critical: Defendants made optimistic Core Capital statements in May, August, and November 2022, while contemporaneously directing sales resources away from Core Capital and receiving complaints about the consequences. This is not innocent misforecasting but knowing concealment of a contemporaneous strategic decision whose negative effects were already materializing. The complaint shows defendants possessed actual knowledge of both the resource reallocation decision and its adverse effects on Core Capital when making contrary representations."

Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements about macroeconomic impacts on the business and existing customer revenue growth while concealing that major customers were reducing usage, demanding discounts, and canceling contracts.

          "scienter_analysis": "While the complaint provides extensive factual allegations regarding Defendants' knowledge of declining customer revenue, it fails to satisfy the PSLRA's heightened pleading standard for scienter. The complaint relies almost entirely on confidential witness testimony regarding internal meetings and knowledge, but does not allege specific, particularized facts showing that Nightingale or Kisling knew their public statements were false when made. The complaint's scienter allegations (¶¶ 194-217) are largely conclusory: 'Defendants knew, or should have known,' 'Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded,' and 'at best, customers were stagnant.' These formulations amount to pleading negligence or 'fraud by hindsight' rather than a strong inference of scienter. Critically, the complaint does not establish when Defendants acquired actual knowledge of the specific falsity of their statements. For example: (1) The November 2023 statements about macro exposure—the complaint alleges customers requested discounts starting in March-April 2023, but does not plead particularized facts showing Nightingale knew in November 2023 that his statement that competitors were seeing macro effects 'and we're not seeing that' was false at that moment. (2) The February 2024 earnings call statements about 'stable' customer retention—the complaint alleges all-hands meetings in November 2023 discussed declining traffic, but does not establish whether traffic had actually declined by February 2024 or was merely projected to decline. The allegation that Nightingale 'tracks top 10, top 20 deals' (¶ 196) is insufficient without specific facts about what data he reviewed before each statement. (3) The complaint relies on CW5's account that Apple and Amazon requested a product in 2023 and Fastly didn't begin work until May 2024, but does not establish that Nightingale knew this when he made May 2024 statements about 'progress.' Innocent explanations are equally plausible: Defendants may have genuinely believed in November 2023 that macro effects were limited to SMB customers; they may have believed in February 2024 that customer retention was stable based on available data; they may have believed their engagement model was making progress based on internal initiatives. The complaint's reliance on confidential witnesses describing general company knowledge does not establish individual defendants' actual knowledge of falsity. The discontinuation of DBNER and NRR metrics (¶¶ 211-217) is alleged as consciousness of guilt, but the complaint does not plead particularized facts showing Defendants knew these metrics would reveal fraud rather than merely showing volatility. The stock sales by Defendants (¶ 218) are mentioned but not connected to specific knowledge of falsity at the time of each statement. Under Tellabs and subsequent PSLRA jurisprudence, the complaint's allegations of knowledge are too general and speculative to create a strong inference of scienter."

The complaint relies heavily on circumstantial evidence and inference rather than particularized facts showing defendants' actual knowledge of falsity when statements were made. Specifically: (1) The complaint alleges defendants 'knew or recklessly disregarded' cGMP issues based on their receipt of batch records, deviation reports, and attendance at monthly meetings with AGC—but receiving reports of manufacturing delays and quality issues does not necessarily establish knowledge that public representations about 'robust cGMP compliance' were false at the time made. The complaint does not allege specific facts showing defendants understood the severity of violations or that they knew approval was impossible. (2) The complaint's reliance on the mock inspection in January 2023 and the subsequent FDA inspection in February 2023 is problematic because these events occurred near the end of the class period and after most challenged statements were made. Defendants' knowledge of problems discovered in late January/February 2023 cannot establish scienter for statements made in 2021-2022. (3) The allegation that Soon-Shiong 'personally reviewed and approved' the BLA before filing and demanded real-time updates during the FDA inspection, while suggestive of control, does not constitute particularized facts showing he knew specific statements were false when made. (4) The complaint characterizes manufacturing delays and missed batch disposition dates as evidence of scienter, but these operational issues—while serious—do not necessarily prove defendants knew representations about cGMP compliance were materially false. Innocent explanations exist: defendants may have believed (albeit unreasonably) that AGC's issues were remediable, that reported problems did not undermine overall cGMP compliance representations, or that risks were adequately disclosed in boilerplate risk factor language. (5) The complaint's expert opinion that violations 'would at a minimum result in a recommendation to withhold rather than approve' is conclusory and does not establish what defendants actually knew or believed in real-time during 2021-2022. (6) The allegation that defendants initiated plans for in-house manufacturing in March 2022 is speculative—it suggests dissatisfaction with AGC but does not prove defendants knew public statements about cGMP compliance were false. (7) The complaint does not allege specific facts distinguishing between defendants' knowledge. Adcock's monthly meetings with AGC and Sachs's approval of contract worker costs suggest awareness of problems, but 'awareness of problems' is insufficient; the PSLRA requires facts supporting a strong inference of intent to deceive or reckless disregard for truth regarding the falsity of specific statements. The complaint conflates knowledge of manufacturing difficulties with knowledge of statement falsity. Under the PSLRA and controlling precedent, this is insufficient."

The complaint alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements about Wells Fargo's compliance with three 2018 regulatory consent orders (from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and CFPB) while concealing that regulators repeatedly rejected the bank's Stage 1 Plan submissions as materially incomplete and inadequate. The complaint alleges defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the bank had not progressed beyond Stage 1 of the compliance process, yet repeatedly assured investors the bank was 'executing' and 'implementing' approved plans and would lift the asset cap by specific near-term dates.",

Defendants received multiple written rejection letters from the Federal Reserve (May 7, 2018 and March 11, 2019) and OCC (July 24, 2018 and November 21, 2018) explicitly stating their Stage 1 Plans were 'materially incomplete,' 'insufficient,' 'lacking substance and detail,' and merely 'plans for plans.' These rejection letters were addressed directly to defendants Sloan and Duke. Defendants also attended in-person meetings with regulators (July 24, 2018; August 11, 2018; March 13, 2019) where regulators orally communicated the same deficiencies. The complaint alleges defendants requested multiple extensions (June 5, 2018; August 24, 2018; June 10, 2019), demonstrating knowledge that Stage 1 Plans were not compliant. Most critically, the complaint alleges that on March 12, 2019, defendant Sloan testified to Congress that the bank 'was in compliance' and 'executing' the plans, and then called the Federal Reserve the same day to apologize for his 'mischaracterizations'—a private admission of falsity that strongly supports scienter. Additionally, defendants Sloan and Duke personally edited SEC proxy filings on March 4, 2019 to remove disclosure that 'substantial' work remained, with Sloan stating investors would learn the bank was 'not close to lifting of the asset cap.' The complaint also alleges that defendant Duke admitted under oath to Congress that Stage 1 Plans required 'resubmission' and that the board had 'red flags' and 'concerns' about the bank's inability to complete the work. These particularized facts—written rejections, oral rejections in meetings, extension requests, Sloan's private apology to the Fed, personal editing of disclosures, and congressional admissions—create a strong inference that defendants knew their public statements were false when made, or were recklessly indifferent to their falsity. The innocent explanation (that defendants genuinely believed the bank was in compliance despite regulatory rejections) is implausible given the contemporaneous written and oral communications defendants received."

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "scienter_analysis": "While the complaint contains extensive factual allegations about a channel-stuffing scheme, it fails to meet the PSLRA's heightened pleading standard for scienter regarding untrue statements. The complaint relies heavily on allegations that defendants 'knew or recklessly disregarded' falsity, but these are largely conclusory. Regarding specific false statements (e.g., 'volumes depend on market conditions,' customers had 'so much capacity'), the complaint pleads facts showing defendants imposed minimum commitments and received customer demand data via EDI systems. However, the complaint does not establish with particularity that defendants knew these statements were false when made. The complaint argues defendants received regular inventory reports from customers and therefore 'must have known' about excess inventory, but this reasoning constitutes impermissible 'fraud by hindsight.' Defendants could have believed (however unreasonably) that customer commitments reflected genuine demand, or that inventory levels were temporary and would normalize. The existence of innocent explanations—such as defendants' stated belief that supply chain constraints justified forward commitments, or that inventory would clear as customers' production ramped—makes a strong inference of scienter implausible. The complaint's reliance on FE 2's hearsay statements that the decision 'went up to Amnon' is insufficient; this does not establish Shashua's actual knowledge of statement falsity at the time of utterance. The complaint does not plead specific facts showing any individual defendant's contemporaneous knowledge that particular statements were false."

          "claim": "Count II: Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) - Scheme to Defraud",
          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "scienter_analysis": "The complaint alleges a 'scheme to defraud' involving channel stuffing, but again fails to establish scienter with the requisite particularity. While the complaint details the mechanics of minimum commitments and volume spikes at year-end, it does not plead specific facts demonstrating that defendants acted with intent to deceive or severe recklessness regarding the scheme's disclosure. The complaint's core allegation—that defendants knew they were shipping excess inventory beyond demand—is supported by circumstantial evidence: (1) defendants received EDI data and customer forecasts; (2) defendants made year-end volume commitments to customers; (3) Q4 volumes spiked 18-23% above Q3. However, these facts are consistent with innocent explanations: defendants may have believed supply-chain hedging justified forward commitments, or that demand would materialize before year-end. The complaint does not plead that any defendant made a contemporaneous statement acknowledging the scheme's deceptive nature, or that any defendant took steps to conceal the practice beyond the challenged public statements themselves. FE 2's testimony that conversations about forcing inventory 'went up to Amnon' is insufficient to establish that Shashua knowingly participated in a fraudulent scheme; it merely shows awareness of business decisions. The complaint's argument that defendants 'must have' known because they conducted 'shipment-to-demand matching analysis' is speculative—the complaint does not allege that such analyses revealed falsity, only that defendants had the capacity to perform them. Severe recklessness requires a showing that defendants acted with 'extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care' and 'reckless indifference to the truth.' The complaint does not allege facts establishing this standard; instead, it relies on defendants' failure to investigate or disclose, which may constitute negligence but not severe recklessness."

          "scienter_analysis": "Section 20(a) liability is derivative of an underlying Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 violation. Because Counts I and II (the underlying securities fraud claims) are dismissed for failure to plead scienter with particularity, Count III must also be dismissed. The complaint adequately alleges that Shashua, Rojansky, Heller, and Galves were controlling persons with authority over public disclosures. However, absent a viable underlying violation, Section 20(a) provides no independent basis for liability. The complaint's allegations that these executives 'influenced and controlled' Mobileye's statements, while true, do not cure the deficiency in scienter pleading for the underlying fraud claims."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "scienter_analysis": "Section 11 imposes strict liability on the issuer (Mobileye) for material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement, without requiring scienter. The complaint adequately alleges that the Registration Statement (filed June 5, 2023) incorporated by reference the 2022 Annual Report and Q1 2023 Quarterly Report, which contained statements that Mobileye 'generally' did not require minimum purchase commitments and that volumes shipped would 'depend upon market conditions.' The complaint pleads with sufficient particularity that these statements were false: Mobileye had imposed minimum commitments on customers representing 70% of revenue, made it 'impossible' for customers to adjust orders, and shipped 4-5 million excess units by the offering date. The complaint establishes materiality through analyst downgrades (25% revenue estimate reductions) following the January 2024 disclosure. The complaint also adequately pleads omissions of material adverse trends under Items 303 and 105 of Regulation S-K: the known existence of 4-5 million excess units already shipped and the risk of 2-3 million more in 2023 were reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future results. Mobileye, as issuer, is strictly liable regardless of scienter. The claim is timely (filed within one year of discovery and three years of the offering)."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "scienter_analysis": "Section 15 liability attaches to controlling persons of an issuer that violates Section 11, provided the controlling person is a 'culpable participant' in the violation. The complaint adequately alleges that Shashua and Heller were controlling persons (CEO and CFO, respectively) who signed the Registration Statement and participated in the offering process. The complaint establishes culpable participation through allegations that: (1) both executives signed documents containing the false statements; (2) both received reports from customers regarding inventory and demand; (3) Heller attended quarterly meetings where customer issues were discussed; (4) Shashua was aware of decisions to 'push inventory' to customers. Unlike the Exchange Act claims, Section 15 does not require proof of scienter for liability; culpable participation suffices. The complaint pleads sufficient facts that Shashua and Heller had actual knowledge of, or recklessly disregarded, the falsity of statements regarding minimum commitments and market-dependent volumes. This is a lower standard than the PSLRA's scienter requirement for Section 10(b) claims. The claim is timely and properly pleaded."

Confidential witness allegations lack sufficient detail tying specific contemporaneous data to individual defendants' actual knowledge of falsity at statement times; post-Class Period admissions constitute impermissible 'fraud by hindsight'; general access to reports and 'core operations' inferences do not overcome equally plausible non-culpable explanations (e.g., optimistic strategy execution despite early warning signs, hoping for recovery); no particularized motive allegations.",

CWs' reporting chains (e.g., to Raja via Laurence) are too attenuated for individualized knowledge. Post-period admissions (e.g., Isom's May/July 2024 statements linking revenue shortfalls to strategy, Q1 'deviation' from peers) are classic hindsight, equally consistent with later recognition of problems rather than contemporaneous scienter. Optimistic statements (e.g., 'encouraged by demand,' 'on right path') amid known risks are puffery or permissible forward-looking views. Core operations doctrine rejected: airline distribution is strategically contested, not obviously fraudulent; innocent explanations (e.g., aggressive execution expecting adaptation, Q1 hope for reversal) at least as compelling[1][2][3].
