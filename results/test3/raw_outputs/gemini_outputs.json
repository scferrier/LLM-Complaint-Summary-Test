      "summary": "The court reviewed a securities class action complaint against Carvana Co. and its executive officers. The complaint alleges a multi-year 'pump-and-dump' scheme where Defendants artificially inflated Carvana's stock price by concealing operational failures, including systematic violations of state title and registration laws, the acquisition of low-quality 'trash' vehicles to boost unit growth, and unsustainable geographic expansion. The complaint relies on testimony from eleven confidential witnesses (CWs), evidence of massive insider trading totaling over $3.87 billion, and subsequent regulatory actions by multiple states. Applying the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA, the court finds that the complaint provides particularized facts—specifically internal meeting accounts and data server access—that create a strong inference of scienter.",

CW-4 describes Huston's awareness of the 'title mess' during the ADESA acquisition discussions. Furthermore, the 'motive and opportunity' prong is exceptionally strong: Garcia Senior's $3.6 billion in sales, characterized by suspicious modifications to 10b5-1 plans to accelerate dumping shares before the truth emerged, provides a compelling inference of fraudulent intent. The sheer scale of the title violations (leading to suspensions in multiple states) makes the 'innocent explanation' of mere pandemic-related administrative delays less plausible than a conscious disregard for legal requirements to maintain growth metrics."

This admission directly contradicts Class Period statements where Defendants claimed they were 'trying to pinpoint' the cause of acquisition slowdowns and attributed them solely to COVID-19 'noise.'

Furthermore, FE-1's allegations of personal conversations with Rawlinson regarding warehouse 'chaos' and inventory failures, combined with FE-5's claims of weekly briefings on the failure of the SAP inventory system, create a strong inference of scienter. The motive to maintain an inflated stock price is bolstered by Rawlinson's $556 million compensation package, which was tied to market capitalization milestones that were triggered during the period of alleged inflation.

The core of the complaint rests on a series of downward guidance revisions throughout 2022 and 2023.

The Proxy touted the 'independence' of the Special Committee while omitting the specific dollar amounts of the TRA windfalls and the last-minute fee increases. Furthermore, the omission of the executive-level contact with the $55/share bidder in September and November 2022 directly contradicts the Proxy's narrative of a 'robust' and 'thorough' process. These omissions were material to a reasonable shareholder's voting decision."

Applying the PSLRA's heightened pleading standards, the court finds that the plaintiffs have provided specific, particularized facts—including internal 'Portfolio Scoring Worksheets' and details of 2018 meetings where the DOJ threatened an 'imminent' indictment and a $1 billion settlement—that create a strong inference of scienter.

In reality, the FDA had repeatedly warned Defendants that the dosing data was inadequate—calling it a 'fatal flaw'—and as of the end of the Class Period, zero patients had been enrolled in the confirmatory study.

The Complaint alleges that as of those dates, zero patients were enrolled—a fact confirmed by Defendant Lebel's later admission during the ODAC meeting. This direct contradiction between public statements and internal reality suggests actual knowledge of falsity. Second, regarding 'dose optimization' and 'alignment' with the FDA, the Complaint cites specific dates of meetings (e.g., Feb 7, 2022, and May 18, 2022) where the FDA explicitly told the Individual Defendants that their dosing data was inadequate and that they were proceeding 'at their own risk.' These particularized allegations of direct communication from the regulator to the defendants demonstrate that Riga and Lebel knew their statements about being 'aligned' were false when made. The inference of fraudulent intent is further bolstered by the Company's precarious financial position (the 'going concern' warning) and the use of an ATM agreement to sell millions of shares of common stock while the price was artificially inflated by these misrepresentations. The fraudulent explanation—that Defendants rushed the NDA and misled investors to facilitate capital raises—is significantly more compelling than any innocent explanation of 'misunderstanding' the FDA's blunt warnings."
