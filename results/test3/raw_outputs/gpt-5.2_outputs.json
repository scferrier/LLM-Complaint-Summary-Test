The complaint relies heavily on generalized “growth-at-all-costs” narratives, post hoc regulatory actions, and confidential-witness accounts that describe operational problems but do not tie contemporaneous knowledge of falsity to specific challenged statements by specific individual defendants at the time they were made. Because the §10(b) claim is dismissed, the derivative §20(a) control-person claim is also dismissed. The §20A insider-trading claim is likewise dismissed because it is pleaded as dependent on the same alleged fraud and does not plead with particularity that each trading defendant possessed specific material nonpublic information at the time of each trade. The Securities Act claims (§§11, 12(a)(2), 15) are not subject to PSLRA scienter pleading, and on this record they are plausibly alleged based on omissions/misstatements in the 2022 Offering Documents regarding pervasive title/registration compliance problems and operational constraints; those claims are sustained at the pleading stage (subject to later proof and statutory defenses).",

But it does not plead, with the required particularity, facts showing that each defendant actually knew specific challenged public statements were false when made. Many allegations are framed as “Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded” and rely on generalized access-to-information theories (executive positions, SOX certifications, Tableau/Google spreadsheets) without identifying specific contemporaneous reports, meetings, emails, or metrics reviewed by a given defendant that directly contradicted a given statement at the time it was made. The CW allegations largely describe conditions ‘well known internally’ but do not connect those conditions to the falsity of particular public statements in a time-specific, defendant-specific way. For example, allegations that employees asked about registration delays on all-hands calls, or that Huston referenced ADESA’s title department, suggest awareness of operational problems, but do not plead that defendants knew earlier representations about compliance, scope, or profitability metrics were false when made.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: The competing, nonculpable inferences are at least as compelling as an inference of intent to defraud. Operational strain during rapid growth, pandemic-era DMV backlogs, and later regulatory actions plausibly support negligence, mismanagement, or overly optimistic public messaging rather than intentional deception. The complaint’s reliance on later admissions, later enforcement actions, and stock-price declines risks ‘fraud by hindsight.’ Insider sales and motives (including large sales and 10b5-1 plan modifications) add some weight but, without particularized contemporaneous facts showing knowledge of falsity, do not create a strong inference that is cogent and at least as compelling as innocent explanations (liquidity, diversification, prearranged sales, or lawful monetization). Accordingly, scienter is not adequately pleaded under the PSLRA."

The more compelling inference is that Musk at least recklessly disregarded the truth of “funding secured” and the asserted near-certainty of the transaction.

Because Musk’s scienter is plausibly alleged and he was the company’s key spokesperson on the subject, the inference that Tesla (through its senior management agent) acted with at least deliberate recklessness is more compelling than an innocent inference that Tesla reasonably believed financing was secured.

The allegations are largely generalized: the Board had ‘responsibility’ to ensure truthful disclosures; Tesla had identified Musk’s Twitter as a channel; and after-the-fact the Board allegedly told Musk to stop tweeting and issued a press release.

The complaint alleges that Netflix later disclosed “over 100m” sharing households and that sharing “hasn’t changed much over the years,” and it extrapolates backward to estimate quarterly sharing-household counts and “effective penetration.” But the PSLRA requires particularized facts showing each defendant’s contemporaneous knowledge that the specific public statements (e.g., “UCAN roughly 60% penetrated,” “ample runway,” “no structural change”) were false or misleading when made. The former-employee allegations are insufficiently particular: FE1 describes a Q2’20 memo about pausing a crackdown during COVID, but does not allege it contained the specific sharing-household numbers or that any individual defendant read it. FE2 alleges that password sharing was discussed at quarterly business review meetings and that Netflix tracked IP addresses, but does not identify dates, presenters, documents, metrics, or the specific quantitative estimates shown, nor does it connect those materials to the precise time windows of the challenged statements or to a particular defendant’s review of a particular report reflecting the alleged “true” numbers. The complaint’s allegations that executives “must have known” because subscriber growth is core to Netflix are classic generalized corporate-knowledge allegations and are not a substitute for particularized facts.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: No strong inference. The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that defendants spoke about penetration based on the company’s paid-membership data and its stated TAM framework (broadband households) and treated account sharing as a risk factor/monetization opportunity rather than as a basis to restate paid-household penetration. The complaint does not plead that Netflix publicly represented that its penetration figures included non-paying sharing households; the alleged falsity depends on plaintiffs’ redefinition of “penetration” to include non-paying households. Even if that could support falsity/materiality, scienter still requires particularized facts that defendants knew investors would understand the statements differently and intentionally or recklessly exploited that misunderstanding. The April 2022 “about face” and market reaction support an inference of changed disclosure posture or changed strategic emphasis, but that is not, without more, evidence of contemporaneous fraudulent intent (fraud-by-hindsight). The allegations that Netflix began testing monetization features in early 2021 and worked on them for ~2 years are also consistent with non-fraudulent business planning and product development in response to a known, long-discussed industry issue. Given these competing inferences, the complaint does not plead a strong inference of scienter that is at least as compelling as the innocent explanations."

The pleading does not identify specific contemporaneous internal reports, meeting dates, emails, dashboards, or metrics reviewed by each defendant that contradicted the precise public statements when made (e.g., what exact validation status existed on August 10, 2021; what exact cartridge yields/line qualification results existed when Moody said “on track”; what exact instrument/component purchase documentation Coe/Moody reviewed when stating “ordered 5,000 instruments”).

The “core operations” theory and executive departures (Coe’s termination; Blaser’s short tenure; Liu’s departure) do not substitute for particularized scienter facts and, as pleaded, are consistent with nonfraudulent explanations (failed execution, governance response to delays, leadership changes after setbacks).

Most notably, FE-2 alleges that in a meeting in October 2021 or the first week of November 2021 Rawlinson stated Lucid would produce less than 10,000 vehicles in 2022 and instructed attendees to keep that information confidential (¶¶ 15, 289). That allegation is not a generic “must have known” inference; it is a direct account of an internal admission tied to the relevant time period immediately preceding the November 15, 2021 public reaffirmation of 20,000 units. The complaint also alleges Rawlinson was repeatedly and directly informed of severe, production-limiting internal logistics failures (e.g., FE-1’s in-person discussions with Rawlinson at the Warehouse in September 2021 and November 2021, describing inability to locate/ship parts, reflashing failures, scrapping, and disorganization) and that Rawlinson visited the Warehouse/Plant frequently and observed the conditions (¶¶ 219-227, 285-286). As to House, the complaint pleads more than position-based knowledge: it alleges her participation in a July 2021 inventory meeting where full physical inventory requests were denied due to “books” concerns (¶ 169), her receipt of escalation emails regarding scrapping approvals (¶¶ 211-213), and her signature on key SEC-filed statements reiterating guidance (e.g., Nov. 15 8-K; Feb. 28 8-K; May 5 8-K). These allegations support an inference she was contemporaneously aware of facts undermining the public narrative that production risk was primarily industrywide and mitigated.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference of intent or at least deliberate recklessness is cogent and at least as compelling as nonfraudulent explanations. The complaint does not rest on “fraud by hindsight”; it alleges contemporaneous internal admissions and repeated internal warnings that production would be far below public guidance, coupled with specific concealment instructions (¶¶ 15, 288-289). It further alleges that Defendants repeatedly attributed production shortfalls primarily to external, industrywide supply-chain issues while allegedly knowing Lucid’s internal logistics and inventory-control dysfunctions were primary bottlenecks (e.g., pervasive inability to locate parts, failed SAP implementation, overcapacity, scrapping, hot calls, and line stoppages) (¶¶ 19-23, 140-177, 185-213, 262-283). The alleged motive allegations (Rawlinson’s performance-based RSUs; the December 2021 convertible notes raise) are not, standing alone, sufficient, but they add marginal weight when combined with the particularized internal-knowledge allegations. Innocent explanations—e.g., optimistic forecasting in a volatile launch environment—are weakened by the alleged internal statement that production would be under 10,000 (not merely “at risk”), the alleged confidentiality directive, and the repeated reaffirmations thereafter. Accordingly, scienter is adequately pleaded under the PSLRA as to Rawlinson, and sufficiently as to Lucid and House at the pleading stage."

          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity at the time of the statements: The Complaint does not plead, for each Individual Defendant and for each challenged statement, specific contemporaneous facts showing actual knowledge that the statement was false when made. The CW allegations largely describe operational problems (ERP/SAP/Salesforce implementation issues, loose warehouse controls, service delays, customer dissatisfaction, returns) and assert that issues were discussed in meetings or that complaints sometimes reached senior leadership. But the pleading rarely supplies the who/what/when/how necessary to show that, at the time particular public statements were made (e.g., ‘successful launch,’ ‘growing adoption,’ SOX certifications), the speaker possessed concrete, contradictory information establishing falsity. Examples: (a) CW statements that ‘many people raised concerns’ to Mowry, or that issues were raised at town halls, are not tied with particularity to the precise content of the later public statements, the dates of internal reports, or the specific metrics that would render the public statements false. (b) Assertions that certain non-party executives (e.g., Pinapati, Huffman) ‘knew’ or were told do not, without particularized linkage, establish that each named defendant knew the challenged statements were false. (c) The restatement and later admissions that inventory was overstated and returns were double-counted plead falsity and materiality more plausibly than they plead contemporaneous fraudulent knowledge; a restatement alone does not establish that defendants knew the original accounting was wrong when reported.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the Complaint holistically and weighing competing inferences, the allegations do not create a strong inference of scienter that is at least as compelling as non-fraudulent inferences. The more cogent inference is that Cutera suffered from deficient controls, a botched systems implementation, operational strain from a new product launch, and poor execution—i.e., negligence or mismanagement—followed by later discovery/quantification of inventory variances and accounting errors requiring a restatement. The Complaint’s scienter theory relies substantially on (i) ‘core operations’ reasoning, (ii) the magnitude and existence of the restatement, (iii) executive departures/terminations, and (iv) compensation incentives tied to AviClear placements. Those allegations, without particularized facts showing contemporaneous awareness of specific falsity, are insufficient under the PSLRA. Incentive compensation and desire to present the rollout positively are common to corporate executives and do not by themselves establish intent to defraud; the termination ‘with cause’ and statements about ‘suboptimal leadership’ more naturally support an inference of failed leadership/execution rather than securities fraud. Because the Complaint does not plead a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness at the time of the challenged statements, the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed."

The core theory—that Phase 2 Bypass was imprudent, contrary to industry practice, and later proved unsuccessful—sounds primarily in hindsight disagreement with a clinical-development strategy and does not, without contemporaneous internal facts, establish scienter. Although the complaint cites an SEC comment process and a single former employee, those allegations do not particularize contemporaneous knowledge of falsity as to the key asserted misstatements (e.g., that Phase 1 data “validated” a dosing schedule, “mitigate[d] safety concerns,” or supported moving to Phase 3). Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed, the derivative Section 20(a) claim is also dismissed.\n\nThe Securities Act claims (Sections 11 and 15) are not subject to PSLRA scienter pleading, but must still plausibly allege a material misstatement or omission in the registration statement/prospectus and traceability.

The complaint largely alleges that Phase 2 Bypass was contrary to customary practice and that Phase 1 data was limited (e.g., 16 patients on the relevant schedule), then concludes defendants therefore knew statements like “validated,” “mitigate safety concerns,” and “based on these data” were false. That is not a particularized allegation of contemporaneous knowledge; it is an inference from later failure and from plaintiffs’ view of what the data should have supported. The SEC comment letters show the SEC required changes to the IPO draft (e.g., removing “late-stage,” removing “best-in-class,” revising pipeline tables), but they do not specifically establish that defendants knew the later challenged statements about Phase 1 “validat[ing]” dosing or “mitigat[ing] safety concerns” were false when made; at most they show regulatory caution about marketing language and depiction of trial progress. The former employee (FE1) allegations are generalized and conclusory as to scienter: FE1 asserts Vellanki and Bryce were ‘aware’ of limitations and that Phase 1 produced a ‘recommended Phase 2 dose,’ but the complaint does not plead concrete contemporaneous internal documents, meeting notes, specific communications, or dates tying either individual to knowledge that the public characterizations were false (as opposed to optimistic or debatable scientific judgments). Nor does it plead particularized facts showing Bryce’s July 2021 statements (e.g., ‘best-in-class’ potential; pride in speed) were made with actual knowledge of falsity rather than puffery/optimism.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: The more compelling inference is nonfraudulent—defendants pursued an aggressive development strategy, made optimistic characterizations about early data, and later the Phase 3 trial failed with safety/efficacy issues. That sequence supports at most mismanagement or overly optimistic corporate messaging, not intent to deceive. The complaint’s theory depends heavily on ‘fraud by hindsight’ (Phase 3 failure and later analyst critiques) and on the proposition that because Phase 2 Bypass was risky, defendants must have intended to mislead. Under the PSLRA, that is insufficient where an equally (or more) plausible explanation is that defendants believed the Phase 1 signal and dosing rationale justified proceeding, even if that judgment proved wrong. Accordingly, scienter is not pleaded with the required particularity and strength."

          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized allegations of knowledge at the time: The complaint pleads more than generalized “must have known” assertions. It alleges that by November 2023 Nightingale personally discussed at company all-hands meetings that major “big whale”/media accounts had “throttled down” usage and that revenue from big customers was decreasing (¶¶18, 88–91). It further alleges a structured weekly Customer Ops process using red/yellow/green throughput ratings for top clients, with senior executives regularly attending and Nightingale occasionally attending (¶¶94–101), and an internal tool (“Fastly App”) to track customer traffic (¶¶92–93, 200). These factual allegations, tied to time (Q4 2023) and to Nightingale’s participation, plausibly support that Nightingale knew the core contrary facts when he publicly stated on Nov. 15, 2023 that competitors were seeing macro slowing but “we’re not seeing that” (¶¶10, 120), and when he later described retention as “stable” and denied fundamental changes on Feb. 14, 2024 (¶¶15, 125, 132–133), while attributing weakness to international traffic without disclosing that several largest customers were simultaneously pulling back (¶¶20, 130–131). As to Kisling, the complaint ties him to the February 2024 guidance explanation that 2024 growth would be driven by “continued expansion of existing customers” (¶126) and alleges that the same internally known large-customer traffic declines and pricing pressure existed by late 2023 and were being discussed internally; Kisling’s later admission that the key rerate dynamics arose in late March/early April (¶160) does not defeat scienter at the pleading stage given allegations that contract-renewal negotiations typically begin ~3 months earlier (¶61, ¶205), and that large-customer traffic declines were already being tracked and discussed by November 2023.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the complaint holistically, the inference that defendants acted with at least deliberate recklessness is strong. The alleged misstatements concern Fastly’s most important revenue driver (usage by existing enterprise/top customers, comprising ~95% of revenue and top-10 concentration ~37%) (¶¶5, 68–69, 128–129). The complaint alleges contemporaneous internal awareness of the opposite trend—declining traffic/usage among the largest accounts—communicated by Nightingale himself in all-hands and tracked weekly via throughput ratings (¶¶18–19, 88–101). That makes it plausible defendants were not merely mistaken about general macro conditions but were aware of specific, material adverse facts contradicting the thrust of their public messaging. While defendants may ultimately argue innocent explanations (e.g., reasonable optimism, volatility in usage, or differing interpretations of “macro” vs. customer-specific traffic), at the pleading stage those explanations are not more compelling than the inference that defendants, having visibility into and discussing the pullback among major accounts, acted at least recklessly by telling investors Fastly was not seeing the macro-related slowing competitors saw and by portraying retention/expansion as stable without disclosing the known multi-account pullback. The complaint also alleges additional circumstantial indicators (discontinuation of DBNER/quarterly NRR beginning Q1 2024 (¶¶211–217) and insider sales (¶218)), which, while not independently sufficient, modestly reinforce the overall inference. Accordingly, scienter is adequately pleaded under the PSLRA."

The core allegation—“clearly no such customer existed”—is conclusory. The later September 2024 company statement referencing $30 million in ‘non-cancellable, non-returnable’ orders (even if viewed skeptically) undermines the complaint’s categorical assertion that no customer existed and highlights the absence of pleaded facts establishing falsity/knowledge as of July 25.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that defendants discussed an anticipated ramp based on then-current customer indications/allocations, and that the program timing, volumes, or customer disclosure posture later changed, leading management to avoid customer-specific discussion in October. The complaint’s ‘cover up’ theory rests on interpretation of call transcripts and the absence of an 8-K, but the securities laws do not require an 8-K for every customer booking, and the absence of an 8-K does not, without more, create a strong inference of fraudulent intent. Motive allegations (stock ownership, options, generalized desire to boost price, alleged insider sales of ~$1 million) are not pleaded with the particularity necessary to show unusual or suspicious trading by the individual defendant who made the statements, nor do they bridge the gap to knowledge of falsity.

There are no confidential-witness allegations, internal reports, meeting dates, emails, dashboards, warranty-claim metrics, customer complaints, board materials, or specific communications to these Individual Defendants tying them to knowledge of the cracking issue during the Class Period.\n\nThe December 7, 2021 manual update adds some plausibility that the Company was addressing connector-cracking risks by that date, but it still does not plead who authored/approved it, whether Faricy or Sial saw it, or that they understood it reflected a then-known pervasive defect requiring a $31 million remediation.

A more plausible innocent inference from the pleaded facts is that the connector-cracking issue was identified through a later product-quality assessment and/or emerged as its scope became clear, prompting a proactive replacement program and an accounting charge in 4Q21; that management’s earlier statements about commercial ‘strength’ and ‘lumpiness’ reflected then-available information about project timing/permitting and segment strategy; and that the risk-factor language was generic and not necessarily a concealment of a known, quantified, pervasive defect.\n\nBecause the complaint lacks particularized allegations tying contemporaneous knowledge to each Individual Defendant, and because innocent explanations are at least as plausible as fraudulent intent, scienter is not adequately pleaded under the PSLRA.

The allegations largely show (i) serious cGMP problems at third-party CMOs and (ii) that senior management was generally engaged with the CMO relationship and later with the FDA inspection process, but they do not tie contemporaneous, defendant-specific knowledge of falsity to the specific public statements challenged—many of which are broad, corporate-capability statements or risk disclosures. Innocent explanations (over-optimistic corporate messaging; reliance on the CMO’s remediation efforts; belief that issues were manageable until the FDA acted; and the common regulatory reality that Form 483s and compliance gaps do not necessarily preordain a CRL) are at least as compelling as an inference of intent to deceive. Because the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed, the derivative Section 20(a) claim is also dismissed.",

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity at the time of the challenged statements: The complaint pleads extensive facts about AGC’s and the fill-site CMO’s cGMP issues (Form 483s in March/July 2021; batch disposition delays; deviations; stability testing misses; reference material issues; failed PPQ runs; Feb. 2023 pre-license inspection and OAI classification; Jan. 2023 fill-site Form 483). It also alleges management involvement (monthly/bi-monthly meetings with AGC; mock inspection; real-time updates during FDA inspection; Adcock travel to site; Soon-Shiong daily calls; alleged BLA sign-off). But the PSLRA requires defendant-by-defendant, statement-by-statement facts showing that, when each statement was made, the speaker actually knew the statement was false or was deliberately reckless. The complaint generally asserts that ImmunityBio was “100 percent” aware of missed batch disposition timelines and that leadership was “nervous,” and it relies on the existence of quality agreements and reporting channels. Those allegations are not tethered to specific dates and specific statements to show that Adcock, Sachs, or Soon-Shiong contemporaneously possessed concrete information that rendered the particular public statements false (e.g., that the CMO was not cGMP-compliant, that “robust” quality oversight was untrue, or that approval was no longer viable). Much of the pleading is framed at a high level (“common knowledge,” “would have been obvious,” “reasonable to infer,” “they knew or should have known”), which is insufficient.\n\nFurther, many challenged statements are generalized descriptions of the Company’s overall GMP capacity, “strategy,” “platforms,” or “preparedness,” often focused on in-house capabilities (NK cell therapy manufacturing) rather than a precise representation that AGC’s specific facility was then in full cGMP compliance. The complaint does not plead particularized facts showing that each defendant understood these broad statements to be false as made, as opposed to corporate puffery or aspirational messaging. As to the repeated risk-factor statements warning that CMOs “may” fail inspections or may be unable to comply, plaintiffs’ theory is essentially that the risks were not hypothetical because problems existed. But the complaint does not plead particularized facts that the Individual Defendants knew, at the time of each filing, that the then-existing CMO issues had crossed a line such that the risk disclosures were rendered misleading (as opposed to accurately describing an ongoing risk environment).\n\nThe strongest scienter-related allegations concern the Feb. 2023 inspection period and the post-inspection statements (Feb. 2023 shelf; Mar. 2023 10-K; Mar. 20, 2023 8-K) that it was “unclear” whether FDA would approve the BLA. Even there, the complaint does not plead with particularity what ImmunityBio/defendants actually received from FDA/AGC as of those statement dates (e.g., the Form 483 itself, the inspection classification, or a definitive FDA communication that approval was off the table). The allegations show concern, intense monitoring, and awareness of deficiencies, but they do not plead specific facts that, by Feb.–Mar. 2023, defendants had definitive knowledge that approval was “no longer viable,” as opposed to uncertain and dependent on remediation and FDA’s ultimate decision.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the more compelling inference is not fraudulent intent but that defendants (a) relied on the CMO relationship and remediation efforts, (b) believed manufacturing issues could be addressed in time or negotiated with FDA, and/or (c) engaged in typical biotech promotional language about manufacturing readiness while facing operational problems. The complaint’s scienter theory relies heavily on (i) the importance of Anktiva to the Company, (ii) defendants’ senior roles, (iii) the existence of quality agreements and meetings, and (iv) the severity of later FDA findings and the eventual CRL. Those are classic “core operations” and “fraud by hindsight” style allegations unless tied to contemporaneous, defendant-specific knowledge of falsity. The fact that FDA ultimately issued a CRL does not itself establish that defendants earlier intended to deceive. Nor does the existence of Form 483s and compliance gaps necessarily mean a facility is categorically non-compliant for securities-fraud purposes at all relevant times; companies often remediate observations and continue operations. The complaint does not plead particularized facts showing that defendants made the challenged statements while consciously disregarding known facts that made those statements misleading.\n\nAccordingly, the complaint fails to plead scienter with the specificity required by the PSLRA, and Count I is dismissed."

CW4’s account that Blair ‘yelled’ and said he and investor relations ‘made up’ better projections after the Q1 2022 call is not pleaded with sufficient detail to support knowledge of falsity of any specific public statement: the Complaint does not identify the particular projections discussed, the numbers proposed by subsidiaries, the numbers ‘made up,’ how they mapped to the specific public guidance later issued, or that the public statements were false as opposed to management’s selection among uncertain forecast inputs. Even crediting CW4, the allegation supports at most aggressive optimism or internal disagreement about forecasting, not a particularized showing that Blair (or McGrew/Ligner) knew specific public statements were false when made.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: Not adequately pleaded. Considering the allegations holistically and weighing competing inferences, the more compelling inference is nonfraudulent: Danaher faced an unusually volatile transition from pandemic-driven demand to endemic/post-pandemic normalization, with long lead times, backlog conversion, changing customer order cadence, and evolving inventory behavior. The Complaint itself describes plausible business reasons for guidance changes (e.g., customers repurposing inventory, funding tightening, China slowdown emerging during Q2 2023). Repeated downward revisions, standing alone, do not create scienter; they are at least as consistent with forecasting error, changing macro/industry conditions, and management learning more over time.\n\nThe insider-sales allegations (Blair and McGrew) and PSU/TSR incentives do not establish a strong inference of scienter. The Complaint does not plead facts showing the trades were unusual in timing or amount relative to prior trading history, were inconsistent with preexisting plans, or were made while Defendants possessed specific, contradictory nonpublic facts. Assertions that a 10b5-1 plan ‘may’ have been adopted during the class period are speculative. Motive and opportunity allegations cannot substitute for particularized contemporaneous knowledge.\n\nFinally, allegations framed as Item 303 ‘known trends’ omissions do not independently establish scienter absent particularized facts that Defendants actually knew of a specific, then-existing trend/uncertainty that made their statements misleading at the time. The Complaint pleads the trend (destocking/funding constraints) largely through later admissions and subsequent results, which risks impermissible fraud-by-hindsight.\n\nBecause Plaintiffs fail to plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter for any Defendant as to any actionable misstatement/omission, Count I is dismissed."

The complaint identifies alleged misstatements/omissions in the press release and proxy (e.g., “independent and disinterested,” “robust process,” “best value reasonably obtainable,” and alleged omissions regarding conflicts, banker fees, and bidder interactions). But the scienter allegations are largely generalized: defendants “knew or recklessly disregarded” because the transaction was important, they held senior positions, and they had access to information. Those are classic ‘must have known’/corporate-knowledge allegations and do not supply particularized facts showing that any specific defendant (e.g., Adolf, Kodialam, McGranahan, Shanahan, Chang, LeMieux, Neuhoff, Morganroth, Feliciani, Carey, Muhtadie) actually knew that a specific challenged statement was false at the time it was made. The complaint does not plead, for example, who drafted particular statements, who reviewed them, what exact contrary facts were presented to each speaker at the time, or contemporaneous communications demonstrating awareness that the disclosures were misleading.\n\nThe complaint’s strongest factual material concerns (i) committee minutes about discussions of bidder interest and process, (ii) the existence of TRA-related incentives, (iii) the timing/amount of committee and Jefferies fee increases, and (iv) Goldman’s concurrent KSFB/NKSFB engagement. Even accepting those as true, they do not, without more, establish that defendants subjectively understood that describing the committee as ‘independent’ or the process as ‘robust’ was false in the securities-fraud sense at the time of publication, rather than an arguable characterization, a materiality dispute, or (at most) negligence about what needed to be disclosed.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: No strong inference. The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that defendants pursued and defended a preferred transaction structure (private equity buyer, rollover, certainty of closing) and made disclosure judgments that plaintiffs contend were incomplete. That is an innocent/non-fraudulent explanation at least as plausible as an intent to deceive the market. The complaint’s ‘additional allegations of scienter’ rely heavily on motive/opportunity (TRAs, rollover, retention, fees) and the importance of the transaction, but motive and importance do not substitute for particularized contemporaneous facts of knowing falsity. The allegations also resemble fraud-by-hindsight: plaintiffs infer fraudulent intent from the later-revealed details and from the assertedly ‘better’ $55 indication, without pleading particularized facts that defendants knew their public statements were false when made.\n\nAccordingly, Count I is dismissed under the PSLRA for failure to plead scienter with particularity and failure to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter."

Although the complaint pleads extensive facts suggesting Walmart had serious CSA compliance problems and that DOJ/DEA activity existed, it largely fails to plead particularized facts showing that McMillon or Biggs actually knew specific SEC-filing statements were false when made (or were deliberately reckless as to their falsity). Much of the scienter theory rests on generalized “core operations,” committee membership, and assertions that it is “inconceivable” executives were unaware—precisely the type of speculation and corporate-knowledge pleading the PSLRA does not permit. The strongest scienter allegations concern McMillon’s consultation on the July 2018 DOJ presentation and the Company’s knowledge that indictment was contemplated; however, the complaint still does not tie those facts to particular challenged statements with the required specificity, nor does it plead facts making fraudulent intent at least as compelling as non-fraudulent explanations (e.g., disputed disclosure judgments about investigations, materiality, and confidentiality of investigative processes). Accordingly, Count I is dismissed for failure to plead a strong inference of scienter, and Count II is dismissed as derivative.",

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity when made: The complaint identifies categories of alleged misstatements/omissions (non-disclosure of investigations/MOA; ASC 450/Item 103/contingencies language; risk-factor boilerplate; opioid ‘stewardship’ statements; SOX certifications). But it does not plead, with the required particularity, facts showing that McMillon or Biggs actually knew that the specific statements in the cited 10-Ks/10-Qs/press release were false at the time of issuance. The pleading relies heavily on (a) their corporate roles, (b) membership on the Ethics, Compliance and Risk Committee, (c) assertions they ‘would have received’ compliance documents, and (d) conclusions that it is ‘inconceivable’ they were unaware. Those are generalized corporate-knowledge allegations, not particularized facts of contemporaneous awareness of falsity.\n\nThe complaint cites internal documents (e.g., 2013 risk assessment, 2014 portfolio scoring worksheet, 2015 proposal) and DOJ/MDL materials showing Walmart’s compliance issues and government scrutiny. But it does not plead who provided those documents to McMillon or Biggs, when they reviewed them, what they read, and how that knowledge rendered particular SEC disclosures knowingly false as opposed to arguably incomplete or framed at a higher level of generality. Similarly, allegations that Walmart produced documents and met with DOJ prosecutors do not, without more, establish that the Individual Defendants knew the precise disclosure language in SEC filings was false (as opposed to believing disclosure obligations were satisfied by generalized references to subpoenas/investigations or by existing litigation disclosures).\n\nThe July 2018 ‘reverse proffer’/planned indictment allegations and the assertion that McMillon was consulted on the DOJ presentation are the most concrete. Even so, the complaint does not connect those facts to a particular challenged statement with the required specificity (e.g., identifying a specific filing/statement after July 2018 and alleging facts showing McMillon/Biggs knew that statement’s wording was false, not merely that an investigation existed). The pleading also does not allege specific internal communications showing the Individual Defendants directed concealment of the investigations from investors or discussed the falsity of the disclosure language.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference that defendants acted with fraudulent intent is not as compelling as nonculpable inferences. A plausible innocent (or at least non-fraudulent) inference is that defendants made disclosure judgments about (i) whether investigative activity rose to the level requiring Item 103 disclosure as a ‘material legal proceeding’ or ‘contemplated’ proceeding, (ii) whether and when ASC 450 required specific disclosure versus generalized disclosure, and (iii) how to describe ongoing government inquiries without prejudicing the Company’s position. The complaint’s reliance on later DOJ allegations, later MDL findings/abatement orders, and post-class-period outcomes risks impermissible ‘fraud by hindsight’—using later-developed facts to infer earlier intent.\n\nMotive allegations (profit, driving sales, avoiding compliance costs) are generic and apply to many companies; they do not substitute for particularized facts of intent to deceive investors. The cited discovery disputes/sanctions in other litigation and assertions of non-cooperation with prosecutors may suggest adversarial litigation conduct, but they do not, without particularized linkage to the challenged investor statements at the time made, create a strong inference of securities-fraud scienter.\n\nBecause the complaint does not plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness as to the truth of the challenged statements when made, Count I is dismissed under the PSLRA."

          "scienter_analysis": "1) PARTICULARIZED KNOWLEDGE OF FALSITY: The Complaint pleads specific, contemporaneous documents and communications showing actual knowledge (not hindsight). It alleges that the Federal Reserve sent a May 7, 2018 rejection letter addressed to Sloan and Duke stating the Stage 1 plan was “materially incomplete” and “insufficient,” and a March 11, 2019 rejection letter again addressed to Sloan and Duke citing “pervasive inaccuracies” and “illogical timeframes,” and warning of “additional actions” upon a third failure. It further pleads OCC rejection letters (July 24, 2018; Nov. 21, 2018) and subsequent OCC communications (Feb. 15, 2019 email; March 4, 2019 report) describing “poor-quality action plans” and “unacceptable” response. These are pleaded as received by, discussed with, or directed to specific defendants (especially Sloan and Duke). The Complaint also pleads internal board emails (e.g., Craver’s “we totally biffed it”) and Duke’s meeting-summary email reporting the OCC said “all their input had been ignored,” supporting contemporaneous awareness.\n\nIt also pleads an affirmative concealment episode: Sloan and Duke allegedly agreed to “tone down” proxy disclosures and remove “substantial amount of work remaining,” with Sloan expressing concern that truthful disclosure would signal the bank was “not close to lifting of the asset cap.” This is a particularized allegation of intent to avoid disclosure.\n\n2) STRONG INFERENCE VS INNOCENT EXPLANATIONS: As to Sloan and Duke, the inference of scienter is strong and at least as compelling as nonculpable explanations. The alleged facts are not merely that compliance was difficult or that timelines slipped; rather, they allege that regulators repeatedly rejected plans as noncompliant while Sloan/Duke publicly represented the bank had “plans in place,” was “executing,” and was “in the midst of implementing,” and they allegedly edited disclosures to avoid admitting “substantial” remaining work. The alleged private apology by Sloan to the Federal Reserve for “mischaracterizations” further supports consciousness of wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, as to Shrewsberry and Parker, the Complaint’s scienter allegations are materially weaker. Although it alleges they spoke publicly and were senior executives, it pleads fewer particularized facts showing they personally received or reviewed the specific rejection letters or were present at the key meetings at the relevant times. Much of the pleading as to them relies on generalized ‘tone at the top’ and access-to-information assertions. Innocent explanations (e.g., reliance on compliance teams, imprecise phrasing about ‘execution’ as internal work rather than regulator-approved implementation) are comparatively more plausible absent particularized allegations tying them to the rejection communications contemporaneously.\n\nAccordingly, Count I is sustained as to Wells Fargo (corporate scienter adequately pleaded through alleged knowledge and conduct of senior leadership who made/approved statements) and as to Sloan and Duke; but the scienter requirement is not adequately pleaded as to Shrewsberry and Parker, and the claim is dismissed as to them."

The pleading largely relies on his CFO role and Operating Committee membership.\n\n2) STRONG INFERENCE: Without particularized contemporaneous facts tying Shrewsberry to the rejection letters/meetings, a nonculpable inference—miscommunication, reliance on subordinates, or imprecise characterization of internal work as ‘execution’—is at least as plausible as fraudulent intent.

          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity when made: Yes, as to the core alleged misstatements about (a) PINNACLE enrollment and (b) FDA “alignment.” The complaint pleads specific FDA interactions and dates (e.g., Dec. 13, 2021 pre–Phase 3 meeting; Feb. 7, 2022 End of Phase 2 meeting; May 18, 2022 midcycle; July 28, 2022 Type B; Sept. 8, 2022 late cycle) in which FDA allegedly told Riga and/or Lebel that dose-optimization data were inadequate, that FDA had not reached agreement on the 8 mg BID confirmatory design and that moving forward would be “at [Spectrum’s] risk,” and that enrollment was delayed and remained at zero. Those allegations are not merely “knew or should have known” assertions; they identify the who (Riga/Lebel), what (FDA non-agreement; inadequate data; no enrollment), when (specific meeting dates), and how (FDA communications during formal FDA meeting types). The complaint further alleges that, notwithstanding those communications, Riga and Lebel made present-tense, concrete statements on March 17, May 12, and August 11, 2022 that Spectrum had “learned to optimize” dosing, that “patients are being randomized,” and that Spectrum was “obviously aligned with FDA” on the confirmatory study. The allegation that, in fact, no patients had enrolled as of those dates directly contradicts the present-tense enrollment statements and supports knowledge/recklessness.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: The pleaded facts support a strong inference of at least recklessness for Riga and Lebel. It is more cogent than any innocent explanation that executives repeatedly warned by FDA about lack of agreement and zero enrollment nevertheless described the trial as enrolling (“patients are being randomized”) and represented FDA alignment. An innocent explanation (e.g., imprecise phrasing, misunderstanding of “initiated” vs. “enrolling,” or belief that alignment existed informally) is less plausible given the alleged repeated FDA warnings that there was no formal agreement and that proceeding was at Spectrum’s risk, and given the binary nature of the enrollment fact (zero patients). The ODAC/FDA briefing materials are alleged to corroborate that FDA had been communicating these concerns throughout development and review, which strengthens the inference that defendants’ contrary public statements were at least reckless.\n\nAs to Brennan, scienter is a closer question because the complaint attributes most FDA-meeting communications to Riga/Lebel. But Brennan is alleged to have signed the Q2 10-Q and participated in the August 11 call while the August 11 press release again stated “patients are being randomized,” and the complaint alleges the true contemporaneous fact was zero enrollment. At the pleading stage, that suffices to plead at least recklessness as to repeating a concrete, verifiable enrollment status in a public filing/press release, though Brennan’s scienter allegations are notably thinner than Riga/Lebel’s."

The Complaint pleads Capone repeatedly represented he held a graduate degree in computational learning theory / an M.S. from Clarkson and tied that credential to DocGo’s AI “backbone.” It further pleads a later public admission that he did not have any master’s degree and that Clarkson had no record of his enrollment. Those allegations support that Capone knew the credential statements were false when made because the truth of his own education is uniquely within his personal knowledge. Likewise, the Complaint pleads Capone stated DocGo had already signed up “over 3,000” asylum seekers for NY Medicaid through UnitedHealthcare and had the ability to enroll them in United’s managed care program, and later reporting quotes both a DocGo spokesperson that DocGo does not enroll anyone in Medicaid and a UnitedHealthcare representative that DocGo had no NY contract—supporting an inference Capone knew (or was reckless in not knowing) these operational facts when he made the statements.\n\nAs to the CBP contract value (“over $4 billion”), the Complaint pleads falsity primarily through a later news article citing a CBP spokeswoman and unnamed sources stating the contract was under $2 billion. It does not plead particularized contemporaneous facts showing what Capone actually knew at the time (e.g., specific bid documents, internal emails, board materials, pricing schedules, or witness accounts showing he was told the value was below $2B). On these allegations, knowledge is not pleaded with the required particularity.\n\nAs to DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer, the Complaint relies largely on their roles, “oversight,” access to information, and their signatures/participation in SEC filings, without particularized facts showing they actually knew Capone’s credentials were false (e.g., specific diligence steps they took/failed to take, specific documents contradicting the credentials that were presented to them, or particular meetings where the falsity was discussed). PSLRA does not permit scienter to be inferred from corporate position alone.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: For Capone’s credential statements, the inference of knowing falsity is cogent and compelling because an executive’s own degrees are not plausibly a matter of confusion over time; the more plausible inference is intentional misrepresentation. For the Medicaid/UHC statements, the inference of scienter is also strong because the statements were concrete (quantified sign-ups and a specific payer relationship) and later contradicted by statements attributed to the company and the payer; on the pleadings, it is at least as plausible Capone knowingly overstated or fabricated these facts to reassure investors amid HPD scrutiny.\n\nBy contrast, for the CBP contract valuation statements, innocent explanations (misunderstanding the total ceiling vs. expected award, reliance on preliminary/contested figures, or imprecision in describing a large multi-year solicitation) are at least as plausible as fraudulent intent given the absence of particularized contemporaneous facts showing Capone knew the true value when he spoke.\n\nDisposition: The claim is sustained only to the extent it is based on Capone’s alleged misstatements about his educational credentials and the Medicaid/UHC sign-up assertions. It is dismissed as to (a) the CBP contract valuation/‘credibility to win’ theory for failure to plead scienter with particularity, and (b) DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer for failure to plead particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter as to those defendants."

These allegations, if true, support actual contemporaneous knowledge that at least some statements about demand tracking, inventory stabilization, and shipment dependence on market conditions were misleading.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference that defendants intentionally (or with deliberate recklessness) misled investors about the demand/inventory dynamics is cogent and at least as compelling as an innocent inference of mere misforecasting. The alleged scheme is multi-year, involves core revenue driver (EyeQ ~90% of revenue), and includes alleged internal escalation to the CEO and customer objections. The complaint also pleads later admissions that the annual commitments constrained customers’ ability to adjust, undermining an innocent “we didn’t know” narrative. While defendants may ultimately argue benign explanations (e.g., customers voluntarily built inventory; management misread the data; macro volatility), at the pleading stage the witness accounts plus admissions and the described mechanics of forced year-end deliveries support a strong inference of scienter.\n\nIndividual-defendant nuance: The strongest scienter allegations are as to Shashua (FE2: decision ‘went up to Amnon’). Scienter is also plausibly pleaded as to Heller based on alleged quarterly executive meetings addressing unusual Tier 1 issues and the centrality of EyeQ revenue. Scienter allegations are weaker as to later CFO Rojansky (joined mid-2023) and communications officer Galves, but the complaint attributes multiple specific statements to them and pleads an overarching course of conduct; at this stage, the Court cannot parse liability with sufficient precision to dismiss them from Count I on scienter grounds alone given the collective factual narrative and their alleged involvement in making/approving the challenged statements."

          "ruling": "sustained",
          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity/illegality: The alleged scheme is not pleaded as mere “fraud by hindsight.” Plaintiffs plead specific operational conduct—imposing annual minimum commitments, refusing cancellations, shipping remaining committed quantities at year-end without purchase orders, and recognizing revenue—supported by FE1 and FE2. FE2 further alleges escalation to CEO Shashua. Those allegations support knowledge of the underlying conduct forming the purported deceptive scheme.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: The same facts supporting Count I support a strong inference of scienter for scheme liability. The alleged conduct (forcing excess product into the channel, then publicly attributing results to demand/market conditions and assuring inventory was stable) is plausibly deceptive rather than merely aggressive sales strategy, particularly given allegations of customer objections and the later admission that the commitment structure made demand adjustment “impossible.” Innocent explanations (ordinary supply-chain contracting, forecasting error, or customers’ unilateral inventory decisions) are less compelling at this stage because the complaint pleads that customers sought to cancel and Mobileye would not allow it, and that Mobileye could ‘push’ product into customers (including Magna CFO’s later statement that Mobileye could do what Magna could not)."

          "ruling": "dismissed",
          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity when made: The complaint pleads that internal tools (SalesLink/PRISM/IATA) showed NDC adoption lagging and corporate/agency share declining, and that CWs observed booking declines (e.g., 15% YoY decline at large agencies; corporate accounts “much lower”). But it does not plead with the required particularity that any Individual Defendant actually received, reviewed, or was presented those specific adverse metrics at the time of the challenged statements. The CW allegations describe CW1/CW2’s access and observations and, at most, assert in generalized fashion that “Defendants knew” because such data existed or was “available,” which is insufficient under the PSLRA. There are no dates, recipients, meeting materials, dashboards, emails, or report distributions alleged tying (i) specific negative figures, (ii) to a specific defendant, (iii) before or contemporaneous with the particular statements (July 2023 through April 2024). The complaint also relies on the defendants’ senior roles and the importance of distribution strategy (a “core operations” theory) to infer knowledge; that is not a substitute for particularized facts of actual knowledge.\n\nThe risk-factor theory (that risks were framed as hypothetical though “actualized”) likewise does not supply scienter. Even if the complaint plausibly pleads that the distribution initiative was causing headwinds, it does not plead that defendants knew, at the time of each filing, that the described risks had already materialized to a degree that made the statements misleading, as opposed to being within the range of expected transition volatility.\n\nThe Bain/Bloomberg allegations do not cure the defect. The complaint pleads that Bain performed a “critical review” and that Raja was fired after feedback. But it does not plead when Bain was retained, what Bain reported, when each Individual Defendant received the report, or what specific findings were known before the April 25, 2024 statements. Those allegations remain speculative as to timing and content.\n\nPost-class statements (May 29 and July 25, 2024) describing execution missteps and revenue impacts do not, without more, plead contemporaneous knowledge of falsity. They are consistent with later-learned information, evolving market conditions, or management’s reassessment and corrective action. Using later disclosures to infer earlier fraud risks “fraud by hindsight.”\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that American pursued an aggressive strategic transition (Modern Retailing/NDC), encountered stronger-than-expected resistance and operational/servicing frictions, and initially believed—perhaps overly optimistically—that adoption would accelerate and that revenue softness would reverse. The complaint itself quotes Isom’s later statement that management “thought that was going to reverse itself. It didn’t,” which supports non-fraudulent misjudgment rather than an intent to deceive. The challenged statements are largely optimistic assessments (e.g., being “encouraged,” “pleased,” “comfortable,” “on track,” “nothing that I see”), mixed with forward-looking guidance. Even assuming some statements could be actionable if knowingly false, the complaint does not plead particularized contemporaneous facts making it cogent and at least as compelling that defendants knew the opposite (e.g., that corporate revenues were not “coming back very materially” as of April 25, 2024).\n\nBecause the complaint does not plead scienter with the PSLRA-required particularity as to any defendant, the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed."
