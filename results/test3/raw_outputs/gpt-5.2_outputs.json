          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge of falsity: Not adequately pleaded. The complaint identifies many challenged statements (e.g., about scalable logistics, capital-light expansion, GPU, and title/registration issues) and alleges operational dysfunction and later regulatory sanctions. But it does not plead, for each specific statement, particularized contemporaneous facts showing the speaker actually knew the statement was false when made. The CW allegations largely describe lower-level observations (quality issues, missing titles, logistics inefficiencies) and generalized internal awareness (“everyone knew”), without identifying specific reports, dashboards, emails, meeting minutes, or metrics that were presented to (or reviewed by) the individual defendants at the time the challenged statements were made, and that directly contradicted those statements. For example: (a) statements about retail unit growth and sustainability are attacked as “unsustainable,” but unsustainability is largely inferred from later declines and later admissions—an impermissible hindsight theory absent contemporaneous contradictory facts; (b) the GPU “manipulation” theory is framed as a disagreement about cost classification (outbound logistics and title/registration in SG&A rather than cost of sales). The complaint does not plead particularized facts showing defendants believed the reported non-GAAP metric was false under the disclosed definition at the time, as opposed to plaintiffs’ view that it was misleading because it omitted other costs; and (c) as to title/registration, CWs describe pervasive delays and later state actions, but the complaint does not plead particularized facts that, when defendants made specific minimization statements (e.g., North Carolina being small/unusual; later progress statements), they possessed concrete data showing the contrary scope/illegality in a way that makes falsity obvious rather than debatable.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: Not met. The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that Carvana pursued aggressive growth and struggled operationally (especially during COVID-era disruptions), with compliance and logistics problems that management attempted to address over time. The complaint’s scienter theory rests substantially on motive/opportunity (insider sales; desire to maintain valuation), generalized “core operations” reasoning, SOX certifications, and later regulatory findings. Under the PSLRA, those allegations—without particularized contemporaneous facts showing actual knowledge of falsity—do not yield a strong inference of intent to deceive that is at least as compelling as innocent explanations. Insider selling, including under 10b5-1 plans, may contribute to an inference, but here it does not bridge the gap where the complaint fails to plead what each defendant knew and when, and the sales are also consistent with diversification/liquidity in a high-volatility growth stock. The allegations therefore do not satisfy the PSLRA’s strong-inference requirement."

The pleading ties falsity and contemporaneous knowledge to specific events (the July 31 PIF meeting; the absence of any discussion of $420 with funders; Musk’s own contemporaneous assessment of only ~50% likelihood; lack of term sheet/commitment/advisors; internal texts/emails reflecting surprise; and Musk’s later admissions/SEC allegations he agreed not to deny). These facts support a strong inference of at least deliberate recklessness, and the competing innocent inference (optimistic but good-faith belief that PIF interest equaled secured funding) is less compelling given the pleaded absence of any price/structure agreement and Musk’s alleged recognition of substantial uncertainty. The Section 20(a) claim against the Board is insufficiently pleaded because it rests on generalized assertions of board-level oversight and post hoc ability to influence communications, without particularized facts showing each director’s actual control over the specific alleged misstatements or culpable participation; moreover, the Complaint does not plead with particularity that the Board members themselves knew of the falsity at the time or exercised actual control over Musk’s tweets when made.

It alleges: (i) the July 31 meeting with the PIF was brief and preliminary, with no term sheet, no signed documents, and no discussion of key terms (including price, structure, amount, ownership, regulatory issues); (ii) Musk chose $420 unilaterally on Aug. 2 based on a premium and a joke, and did not discuss $420 with PIF or any financier before tweeting; (iii) Musk contemporaneously believed there was “a lot of uncertainty” and only ~50% likelihood of consummation; (iv) he had not retained advisors or obtained board approval for a formal proposal at the time; (v) contemporaneous internal/external reactions (IR director texting “Was this text legit?”; analysts asking about funding details; IR responses reflecting lack of knowledge) support the inference the tweet was not grounded in an actual commitment; and (vi) the pleading relies on Musk’s later admissions/SEC-alleged facts he agreed not to deny, including that the statements were “premised on a long series of baseless assumptions” and contrary to facts he knew. These are not merely “knew or should have known” allegations; they identify what Musk knew (no agreed terms/commitment; no $420 discussion; substantial contingencies) when he spoke.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference that Musk acted with intent or deliberate recklessness is at least as compelling as any nonfraudulent inference. The pleaded facts show Musk publicly stated “funding secured” and “only reason this is not certain is … shareholder vote” despite recognizing major unresolved contingencies and lacking any commitment at the stated price. An innocent inference (Musk genuinely believed PIF enthusiasm equaled secured funding) is weakened by the pleaded absence of any price discussion, the acknowledged uncertainty, and the magnitude/definitiveness of the public claims. At the pleading stage, these particularized allegations satisfy the PSLRA’s strong-inference requirement as to Musk.

These allegations do not identify, with particularity, any contemporaneous internal report, dashboard, memo, or meeting material that quantified account-sharing households (or UCAN penetration) during the class period, when it was generated, who received it, and that any specific Individual Defendant reviewed it before making the challenged statements (e.g., Neumann’s ‘roughly 60% penetrated’ UCAN remarks; ‘no structural change’ comments). FE2’s account of quarterly reviews is not anchored to dates, does not describe the specific metrics shown, and does not connect the content of any presentation to the precise allegedly false public statements. FE1’s memo allegation concerns pausing a crackdown during COVID for reputational reasons; it does not plead that the memo contained the later-disclosed quantitative figures or that any defendant read it. The complaint’s penetration calculations are plaintiffs’ reconstructions from later disclosures, which is insufficient under the PSLRA to plead that defendants knew the earlier statements were false when made.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: Not adequately pleaded. The more compelling inference is nonfraudulent: Netflix publicly acknowledged account sharing for years, disclosed it as a risk factor (including that abuse could hinder growth), and later—amid slowing growth and an evolving monetization strategy—publicly quantified its estimate and reframed its narrative. The complaint’s theory largely amounts to ‘they must have known’ because Netflix could monitor sharing and later disclosed estimates; that is the kind of speculation and hindsight pleading the PSLRA forbids. Allegations of testing paid-sharing features and monitoring account sharing support awareness of the issue, not intent to deceive about specific penetration levels. Absent particularized facts tying quantified internal knowledge to the speakers and the timing of the challenged statements, the allegations do not yield a strong inference that defendants acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness, as opposed to making optimistic/interpretive statements about growth drivers while lacking (or not treating as sufficiently reliable) a precise, reportable estimate until later."

          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge-of-falsity allegations: As to Rawlinson, the complaint pleads specific, time-bounded facts that he knew the production guidance was unattainable when publicly reaffirmed. Most notably, FE-2 alleges Rawlinson stated in an October 2021 or first-week-of-November 2021 meeting that Lucid would produce fewer than 10,000 vehicles in 2022 and instructed attendees to keep that information confidential (¶¶ 15, 289). The complaint also pleads repeated direct communications to Rawlinson from FE-1 in September and November 2021 that warehouse/logistics dysfunction made the targets impossible, coupled with Rawlinson’s frequent in-person visits to the warehouse/plant where the alleged conditions were visible (¶¶ 219-227, 285-286). In addition, the complaint pleads Rawlinson’s access to (and/or receipt of) recurring internal reports and meetings describing inventory-system failures, hot calls, line stoppages, and logistics bottlenecks (e.g., Daily AM/PM reports; end-of-shift meetings; ¶¶ 228-229). As to House, the complaint pleads fewer direct knowledge facts, but includes a July 2021 inventory meeting attended by House where inventory-control accuracy was discussed (¶ 168) and allegations that House received/was copied on emails seeking approval to scrap tens of millions of dollars of inventory to ‘start fresh’ (¶¶ 211-213), supporting awareness of severe internal logistics dysfunction while the company continued to attribute constraints largely to generalized industry supply-chain issues.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference that Rawlinson acted with at least deliberate recklessness is strong. The complaint alleges contemporaneous internal recognition of materially lower achievable production (<10,000) while Rawlinson publicly reaffirmed 20,000 (Nov. 15–16, 2021) and later 12,000–14,000 (Feb. 28, May 5, May 20–26, 2022), repeatedly framing the principal constraints as industrywide supply-chain/logistics issues being mitigated. The alleged instruction to keep the <10,000 figure confidential materially strengthens scienter and distinguishes the pleading from ‘fraud by hindsight.’ The pleaded facts also support that defendants’ repeated causal narrative (external supply-chain constraints) omitted known, severe, company-specific logistics breakdowns that were already causing frequent shutdowns and inability to move parts to the line. While defendants may argue nonfraudulent explanations (good-faith forecasting, rapidly changing conditions, prioritizing quality, pandemic disruption), those explanations are less plausible at this stage given the alleged internal admission of a sub-10,000 outcome months earlier and the detailed allegations of persistent, structural logistics failures known to senior leadership. The complaint therefore meets the PSLRA requirement to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter."

That is not the same as pleading that defendants knew their statements were false at the time—i.e., that they did not believe the Phase 1 results supported the chosen schedule or Phase 3 initiation, or that they knew the statements were objectively untrue rather than debatable scientific judgments.\n\nThe SEC-comment correspondence is not a particularized admission of falsity of the later challenged statements. The SEC letters (as quoted) primarily concern (a) characterizing Rain as ‘late-stage,’ (b) pipeline-table presentation implying progress, and (c) avoiding ‘best-in-class’/‘first-in-class’ inferences. They do not specifically state that Rain could not reasonably describe Phase 1 data as supporting Phase 3 initiation, nor do they show that Vellanki/Bryce knew such statements were false. Re-using ‘late-stage’ language after the SEC comments may support negligence or poor compliance, but the PSLRA requires particularized facts of intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness as to falsity.\n\nThe former employee allegations (FE1) are also insufficiently particularized. FE1 offers generalized opinions that Phase 2 is usually needed to ‘dial in’ dosing and that Phase 1 recommended a ‘Phase 2 dose.’ FE1 then asserts Vellanki and Bryce ‘were aware’ of limitations and ‘understood’ the Phase 1 data. But the complaint does not plead the required detail: what specific internal documents, meetings, emails, or contemporaneous statements show that either individual believed the public statements were false; when and how FE1 conveyed contrary information; what exactly was said; and how that contradicts the challenged statements. Under the PSLRA, such conclusory ‘they knew’ assertions and generalized corporate-knowledge allegations do not suffice.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: Not adequately pleaded; innocent explanations are at least as plausible. The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is that defendants made optimistic characterizations of early clinical data and pursued an aggressive development strategy typical of clinical-stage biotech companies seeking speed-to-market and capital efficiency—conduct that may be risky or even imprudent, but is not inherently fraudulent. The later MANTRA failure and analyst commentary that dosing ‘was too high’ are classic ‘fraud by hindsight’ allegations and do not establish that defendants knew, at the time of the challenged statements, that Phase 3 would fail or that the dosing schedule was not supportable. The complaint’s motive allegations (need to fundraise, desire to save time/money, first-to-market) are generalized and common to virtually all issuers; they do not create a strong inference of scienter absent particularized facts tying motive to knowing falsity.\n\nAccordingly, Count I is dismissed for failure to plead scienter with particularity and to allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter."

The complaint relies heavily on (a) confidential witnesses describing discount requests, churn, and internal discussions; (b) generalized allegations that the C-suite ‘knew’ because of all-hands meetings, internal tools, and weekly customer-ops meetings; (c) later disclosures in May/August 2024; and (d) insider sales and discontinuation of certain metrics.\n\n(1) Knowledge of falsity when made. The complaint does not plead with particularity that Nightingale or Kisling had contemporaneous, statement-specific knowledge contradicting what they said publicly. The all-hands allegations (Nov. 2023 discussion of ‘big customers’ throttling down) support that management knew of some traffic softness, but they do not plead the magnitude, duration, or financial impact necessary to show that statements like ‘we’re not seeing’ macro headwinds, ‘customer retention efforts were stable,’ or guidance assumptions about ‘continued expansion’ were knowingly false as stated, rather than debatable characterizations in a business where usage and traffic fluctuate and where retention/expansion metrics can remain positive despite pockets of weakness.\n\nCritically, the May 1, 2024 disclosures attribute the most acute guidance reset to dynamics that ‘arose really at the end of March and in early April’ (larger-than-expected rerate discounts without commensurate traffic expansion and reversal of consolidation). That timing undercuts an inference that, in November 2023 or February 2024, defendants necessarily knew the later-described rerate/traffic combination would materialize to the extent it did. Allegations that contract negotiations typically begin three months before renewal and thus defendants ‘should have known’ by January 2024 are precisely the kind of ‘knew or should have known’ and speculative corporate-knowledge pleading the PSLRA does not permit.\n\nThe CW allegations about cancellations (Indeed, USAA) and discount requests show sales headwinds, but they do not connect to what Nightingale or Kisling actually reviewed, when, and how that information rendered the specific public statements false. Nor do the CWs identify specific reports, dashboards, emails, board materials, or meeting minutes reviewed by Nightingale/Kisling that quantified enterprise retention deterioration or established that ‘retention efforts were stable’ was false at the time. Assertions that ‘anyone’ could see traffic in an internal app, or that executives ‘occasionally’ attended weekly meetings, do not plead that these defendants actually saw data contradicting their public statements.\n\n(2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations. Considering the allegations holistically, the competing nonfraudulent inferences are at least as compelling as fraudulent intent: (i) management optimism and/or imprecise public messaging about macro conditions and customer behavior; (ii) volatility and forecasting difficulty inherent in usage-based revenue and multi-CDN traffic allocation; (iii) a good-faith belief that engagement-model changes could stabilize large accounts; and (iv) a later-emerging, sharper-than-expected rerate/traffic dynamic crystallizing in late March/early April 2024.\n\nThe additional scienter indicators do not tip the balance. Insider sales are pleaded in gross share/proceeds terms without the context typically required to infer scienter (e.g., percentage of holdings sold, trading history, 10b5-1 plans, timing relative to specific statements). Discontinuation of DBNER/quarterly NRR is not, without more, a particularized fact showing intent to conceal fraud; companies may change metrics for multiple reasons, and the complaint does not plead internal communications showing the change was adopted to hide known falsity. The complaint’s repeated reliance on ‘known throughout the Company’ and ‘C-suite absolutely knew’ is generalized corporate knowledge, not the individualized, contemporaneous facts required.\n\nAccordingly, plaintiffs fail to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference that Nightingale or Kisling acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness.

Motive allegations are also insufficient: Vinciarelli’s large equity stake and options (¶¶ 97–99) describe a common executive incentive to see stock price rise, not particularized fraudulent intent. The complaint also alleges ‘certain Vicor insiders’ sold ‘well over $1 million’ (¶ 100) but does not identify who sold, whether Vinciarelli sold, whether sales were unusual in timing/amount, or how they support an inference that the July 25 statements were known false when made.

It further pleads a January 2023 mock inspection with results presented to Adcock/Sender, and real-time daily calls during the February 2023 FDA inspection, including that Soon‑Shiong demanded updates and Adcock traveled to the site. These allegations support that ImmunityBio leadership was aware of operational/manufacturing difficulties and heightened regulatory risk. But the Complaint does not plead with the required particularity that each Individual Defendant knew, at the time of each challenged statement, that the specific representations at issue were false—e.g., that statements touting ‘GMP manufacturing capacity at scale’ or describing the Anktiva manufacturer as having ‘multiple cGMP-compliant facilities’ were understood internally as false descriptions of AGC’s compliance status at the Bothell facility at the relevant times. The CW allegations are largely generalized (e.g., ‘leadership reviewed,’ ‘common knowledge,’ ‘very concerned’) and do not identify specific documents, emails, board materials, or contemporaneous reports provided to Adcock, Sachs, or Soon‑Shiong that directly contradicted the public statements when made.

Considering the allegations holistically, the inference of scienter is not ‘cogent and at least as compelling’ as nonculpable explanations.

Even after the February 2023 inspection, the Complaint does not plead particularized facts that Defendants actually knew the inspection outcome would necessarily preclude approval (as opposed to posing material risk) at the time they stated approval was ‘unclear’ or that they were preparing for ‘potential’ approval. The Complaint’s reliance on the later CRL and the severity of the Form 483/OAI classification to infer earlier intent risks impermissible fraud-by-hindsight.

It further alleges extensive internal remediation (nine process changes through Q4 2021) and regulatory interactions/root-cause analyses. Critically, it pleads Hayes’s own later admissions (July 25, 2023 and Sept. 11, 2023 calls) that the issue was uncovered in 2020, that the company knew the suspect population existed, and that the manufacturing-process changes occurred in 2021. Taking those pleaded admissions as true at the motion-to-dismiss stage, they support an inference that Hayes knew (or was at least deliberately reckless in not knowing) that public statements during 2021–2023 describing GTF issues as ‘addressed,’ ‘behind us,’ or fully accounted for were misleading insofar as they omitted the known contamination population and the likelihood of large-scale removals/inspections.\n• Mitchill / O’Brien / Calio / Eddy: The complaint identifies public statements by each, but does not plead comparably particularized facts showing what each actually knew at the time. The former-employee allegations describe internal awareness at engineering/operations levels and meetings (e.g., an August 2019 telcon; discussions in 2023 ‘coffee talks’; shifting cost estimates), but they are not tied with specificity to these speakers’ receipt of reports, attendance at identified meetings, contemporaneous emails, or other concrete channels of knowledge. Allegations that they were senior executives, that the GTF was a core operation, that they signed SEC filings, or that they ‘must have known’ are insufficient under the PSLRA.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations:\n• RTX / Hayes: The more compelling inference is at least recklessness (and plausibly intent) as to the omission/mischaracterization of a known manufacturing escape affecting a multi-year population of engines. Hayes’s alleged admissions that the issue was uncovered in 2020, that a suspect population existed, and that remediation took 18 months, when juxtaposed with repeated public assurances during the Class Period that issues were ‘addressed,’ ‘behind us,’ and fully contemplated in guidance, supports a strong inference that Hayes acted with scienter. Innocent explanations (e.g., evolving engineering understanding, uncertainty about scope, reliance on models) are less compelling at this stage because the pleading alleges contemporaneous knowledge of the suspect population timeframe and the need for significant process changes, plus subsequent disclosures describing the issue as requiring accelerated removals and multi-billion dollar impacts.\n• Mitchill / O’Brien / Calio / Eddy: As to these individuals, the inference of nonfraudulent conduct (optimistic but incomplete public messaging; reliance on subordinates; evolving understanding of scope/timing; compartmentalized knowledge) is at least as plausible as fraudulent intent because the complaint does not plead particularized contemporaneous knowledge of falsity. Under Tellabs and the PSLRA, that is insufficient to plead a strong inference of scienter as to each of them.\n\nDisposition: The claim is sustained as to RTX and Hayes only, and dismissed as to Mitchill, O’Brien, Calio, and Eddy for failure to plead scienter with the required particularity."

The core theory is that Danaher’s bioprocessing guidance and commentary proved overly optimistic and was repeatedly revised downward as market conditions evolved (COVID roll-off, customer destocking, biotech funding constraints, China weakness). That is not enough. Most allegations amount to fraud by hindsight and generalized assertions that defendants ‘must have known’ because bioprocessing was important, because Danaher had forecasting processes, and because analysts asked questions. The only arguably particularized scienter allegation—CW4’s claim that Blair ‘made up’ projections with IR—is not pleaded with sufficient detail and reliability to support a strong inference of intent to defraud, and in any event does not tie specific contemporaneous internal data to specific challenged public statements and explain why those statements were false at the time.

The complaint pleads that defendants issued optimistic forecasts and reassurances about bioprocessing demand, inventory/destocking, and COVID-related revenues, then later reduced guidance as conditions worsened. But it does not plead specific contemporaneous facts showing that, at the time of each statement, Blair, McGrew, or Ligner actually knew the statements were false. Allegations about Danaher’s general forecasting ‘rollup’ process, ‘customer intimacy,’ surveys, and the importance of bioprocessing are generalized corporate-knowledge allegations, not particularized facts of what each individual defendant learned, when, from whom, and how that information contradicted the public statements. The complaint also does not identify specific internal reports/metrics (e.g., customer-level order cancellations, inventory levels, backlog quality, China order trend, monthly FC forecasts for bioprocessing) presented to the individual defendants on specific dates that rendered the challenged guidance unattainable when issued.\n\nThe CW allegations largely do not bridge this gap. CW1 describes helping Blair prepare for town halls and reviewing operating results/metrics, but does not identify what metrics showed, when they showed it, and how they contradicted specific public claims. CW2 and CW3 concern forecasting mechanics in EAS/water-quality businesses, not bioprocessing, and do not supply defendant-specific knowledge about Cytiva/Pall orders or inventory. CW4’s allegation that Blair ‘yelled’ on a post–Q1 2022 call and said he and IR ‘made up’ better projections is conclusory and lacks the necessary particulars (date/time, who was present, what projections were changed, what the original subsidiary projections were, what the ‘made up’ figures were, and how they mapped onto specific public guidance). It also does not plead that McGrew or Ligner participated in or knew of that alleged conduct. Without those particulars, CW4 does not support a strong inference that any specific public statement was knowingly false when made.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is nonfraudulent—management made forward-looking judgments in a volatile post-pandemic demand environment, initially underestimated the magnitude/duration of destocking and funding headwinds, and updated guidance as visibility improved. The complaint’s narrative tracks a common pattern of forecast revisions in changing markets; that is at least as plausible as intentional deception. Assertions that defendants ‘denied’ stockpiling or overstated resilience are not enough absent particularized contemporaneous contradictory facts known to defendants. The insider trading allegations do not materially change the calculus: the complaint does not plead the context necessary to show the sales were unusual (e.g., 10b5-1 plan details, trading history, total holdings over time, percentage of compensation, or whether sales were pre-scheduled/consistent). The ‘core operations’ theory (bioprocessing’s importance) and analyst questioning are insufficient under the PSLRA to establish scienter without specific contradictory internal information.\n\nAccordingly, the complaint fails to plead scienter with the required particularity and fails to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of intent or deliberate recklessness."

But it does not plead with the required particularity that Diab, Jordan, or McKnight actually received or reviewed any specific report showing the allegedly true attrition figure contemporaneously with each challenged statement (e.g., Feb. 22 investor presentation; April/May proxy materials; May 20 statements; forecasts). Assertions that executives ‘had access’ to databases, that ‘leaders talked about attrition’ at all-hands meetings, or that decks were ‘intended for’ leadership are insufficient under the PSLRA without details tying particular documents, dates, recipients, and content to each defendant at the time of the statements. As to McKnight (a FVAC executive/director), the complaint pleads even less—no concrete facts showing he knew ATI’s actual attrition metrics when he signed/authorized statements.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: The pleaded facts support at least equally plausible non-fraud inferences: ATI faced a difficult post-COVID labor market and operational disruption; management may have been overly optimistic about retention, staffing, and projections; and the July/October guidance reductions reflect a rapid deterioration or belated appreciation of magnitude rather than intentional deception.

The scienter theory largely rests on (i) generalized assertions that defendants “must have known” given Phase 2a’s importance, (ii) hindsight from the March/June 2021 disclosures, and (iii) insider sales without the necessary context (e.g., trading plans, percentage of holdings, prior history, or suspicious timing tied to specific internal knowledge). Although CW1 alleges investigators raised screening/exam discrepancies to LeBel and that internal personnel were aware inclusion/exclusion criteria were circulating online, the Complaint does not plead specific, contemporaneous facts showing that, when defendants made the challenged statements (Oct. 29, 2020; Nov. 16, 2020; Jan. 11, 2021; Jan. 19, 2021), defendants actually knew the trial was so compromised that their representations were false or misleading, as opposed to recognizing a risk of some attempted gaming that sites could address through standard screening controls. Innocent explanations—ordinary clinical-trial variability, isolated protocol deviations, and later-learned placebo effects prompting a post hoc bias assessment—are at least as plausible as fraudulent intent.

But it does not plead with particularity the who/when/what necessary to show that, at the time of each challenged statement, LeBel (or Lucchino) actually knew the Company’s categorical statements (e.g., “all subjects have meaningful word recognition deficits,” “entrance criteria required,” and the suggestion that the deficit threshold was not disclosed) were false. Missing are specifics such as: dates of investigator communications; number/percentage of affected subjects; what LeBel was told; what internal reports, meeting minutes, emails, or monitoring logs showed; whether deviations were confirmed and escalated; and whether management concluded the trial was materially biased before March 23, 2021. Allegations that defendants ‘knew or recklessly disregarded’ and that the ‘exact date can only be uncovered through discovery’ are insufficient under the PSLRA.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: The competing inferences do not yield a strong inference of intent to deceive. The pleaded facts support, at most, that management was aware of a risk that some applicants might try to game subjective testing—an ordinary clinical-operations issue—rather than that defendants knew the enrolled cohort materially failed inclusion criteria or that the trial was ‘hopelessly biased’ at the time of the statements. The March 23, 2021 and June 30, 2021 disclosures more naturally support an inference that the Company assessed unexpected placebo-group changes and baseline unreliability after reviewing interim/final data and historical audiograms, then concluded bias ‘potentially’ affected the design—i.e., a later-learned problem rather than a contemporaneously concealed known falsity. The insider-sales allegations do not cure the deficiency: the Complaint provides aggregate monthly sales and profits but omits key context (10b5-1 plan allegations, percentage of holdings sold, prior trading patterns beyond a limited window, and linkage to specific nonpublic information). Core-operations allegations likewise cannot substitute for particularized facts of actual knowledge.

The dispositive issue on this motion, however, is scienter as to each defendant at the time of the challenged statements. The complaint’s scienter allegations are largely generalized (core-operations, “must have known,” access to metrics, board oversight, and widespread internal problems) and do not plead with particularity that most individual defendants actually knew their specific statements were false when made, as opposed to being overly optimistic, imprecise, or later shown wrong. By contrast, as to the October 2 crash-related communications, the complaint pleads detailed, time-stamped facts from the Quinn Report supporting actual knowledge by Cruise and Vogt (and, to a lesser extent, West) that Cruise’s public-facing narrative omitted the post-impact pullover/dragging and that Cruise chose not to correct that narrative. Those allegations support a strong inference of scienter for a narrower set of misstatements/omissions tied to the crash response. Accordingly, Count I is sustained only as to Cruise and Vogt (and limited to the October 2 crash-related misstatements/omissions and closely related public statements about cooperation with regulators), and otherwise dismissed. Count II is dismissed because, as pleaded, it impermissibly attempts to repackage misstatement claims as a “scheme” without particularized facts showing each defendant’s deceptive acts and scienter beyond the alleged misstatements.

These allegations support actual knowledge by Cruise and Vogt of the misleading omission at the time the crash-response statements were disseminated.\n\nAs to West, the complaint pleads he attended the 6:00 a.m. CMT meeting where dragging was discussed and that he messaged Vogt about continued travel after impact. That supports awareness of the omitted fact, but the complaint does not plead with comparable specificity that West authored, approved, or caused the challenged public statements to be issued after he learned the information.\n\nAs to GM, Barra, Jacobson, Ammann, and Parks, the complaint largely relies on (i) “core operations,” (ii) access to reports/metrics, (iii) board involvement, and (iv) the existence of internal safety issues and remote assistance. Those allegations do not, with the required particularity, identify what specific contradictory facts each of those defendants actually knew at the time of each challenged “Level 4/fully driverless/safer than human” statement, nor do they tie those defendants to specific internal documents, meetings, or admissions establishing contemporaneous knowledge of falsity. Assertions that executives “must have known” because the subject was important, or because metrics existed, are insufficient under the PSLRA.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: For Cruise and Vogt regarding the October 2 crash-response communications, the inference of intent to deceive (or at least deliberate recklessness) is strong: (a) time-stamped internal awareness of the dragging; (b) selective dissemination of an incomplete video cut; (c) continued provision of “complete stop” talking points after leadership discussion; and (d) alleged concern about “losing credibility” by correcting prior statements. That inference is at least as compelling as innocent explanations.\n\nFor the broader pre-crash “Level 4/fully driverless/safer than human” statements, innocent explanations are at least as plausible as fraudulent intent on this pleading record: e.g., defendants may have used non-technical marketing language, relied on regulatory permitting status, believed remote assistance did not negate “driverless” in their operational conception, or believed safety metrics supported comparative claims. Without particularized allegations of contemporaneous contradictory facts known to each speaker, the PSLRA strong-inference requirement is not met.\n\nDisposition: Sustained only as to Cruise and Vogt, and only as to the crash-related misstatements/omissions and closely related public statements about cooperation with regulators; dismissed as to GM, Barra, Jacobson, Ammann, Parks, and West, and dismissed to the extent based on the broader ‘Level 4/fully driverless/safer than human’ theory."

As pleaded, it does not particularize—defendant by defendant—what deceptive conduct (separate from speaking) each engaged in, when they engaged in it, and how it operated as a fraud.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations: Even assuming Cruise/Vogt’s crash-response conduct reflects culpable intent, Count II is pleaded as an omnibus scheme claim against all defendants and across the entire Class Period. For most defendants, the scienter allegations are generalized and permit equally plausible non-fraudulent explanations (corporate optimism, negligence, internal disagreement, or post hoc inference from later events).

          "scienter_analysis": "1) Particularized knowledge allegations: As to Riga and Lebel, yes. The Complaint pleads with date-and-content specificity multiple FDA interactions in which FDA allegedly communicated the very issues later revealed publicly: (i) pre-Class Period and during-Class Period meetings where FDA repeatedly said dose-optimization data were inadequate and additional data/studies were needed; (ii) FDA did not agree to the 8 mg BID confirmatory-trial design and warned proceeding was “at [Spectrum’s] risk”; and (iii) FDA repeatedly raised concerns about delayed confirmatory-trial enrollment. These allegations are tied to identified meetings (e.g., Dec. 13, 2021; Feb. 7, 2022; May 18, 2022; July 28, 2022; Sept. 8, 2022) and identify the participants as Riga and/or Lebel. The Complaint also pleads that, notwithstanding those communications, Riga and Lebel made specific present-tense statements (e.g., May 12 and Aug. 11: “Patients are being randomized”) and statements of FDA “alignment” on the 8 mg BID design. If those FDA communications occurred as alleged, Riga and Lebel would have known the “alignment” and “patients are being randomized” statements were false/misleading when made.\n\nAs to Brennan, no. The Complaint alleges she signed/approved SEC filings and participated in an Aug. 11 call, but it does not plead particularized facts showing she attended the FDA meetings, received the FDA feedback, or otherwise had contemporaneous access to the contrary information. Allegations that she was CFO/Audit Committee chair, certified filings, and participated in ATM financings are insufficient under the PSLRA to plead her actual knowledge.\n\n2) Strong inference of scienter: As to Riga and Lebel, yes. The most compelling inference from the pleaded chronology is that Riga and Lebel were repeatedly told by FDA that (a) FDA had not agreed to the 8 mg BID confirmatory-trial approach and (b) the confirmatory trial was not meaningfully underway, yet they publicly conveyed FDA “alignment” and that patients “are being randomized.” Those are not merely optimistic interpretations; they are alleged to be concrete, present-tense representations about trial status and regulator agreement. The competing innocent inference (miscommunication, misunderstanding, or mere corporate optimism) is less plausible given the alleged repetition and specificity of FDA feedback over multiple meetings and the binary nature of the enrollment fact (no patients enrolled). Motive allegations (cash needs/ATM sales) add some support but are not necessary.\n\nAs to Brennan, the more plausible inference from the pleaded facts is nonculpable: she signed filings and participated as a finance executive without particularized allegations that she actually knew the enrollment/‘alignment’ facts were false at the time. Under the PSLRA, that is insufficient.\n\nAccordingly, Count I is sustained as to Spectrum, Riga, and Lebel, and dismissed as to Brennan."

          "scienter_analysis": "PSLRA scienter requires particularized facts giving rise to a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or deliberate recklessness.\n\n(1) Particularized knowledge of falsity at the time:\n• Capone — Educational credentials: The Complaint pleads particularized facts supporting actual knowledge because the truth of whether Capone earned/enrolled in the claimed graduate program is uniquely within Capone’s personal knowledge. The Complaint also quotes multiple instances where Capone affirmatively represented he had a graduate degree in computational learning theory / AI. Those allegations support that Capone knew the statements were false when made.\n• Capone — Medicaid sign-ups: The Complaint pleads that Capone stated DocGo had “already signed up over 3,000” migrants “through UnitedHealthcare,” and later DocGo allegedly admitted it “does not enroll anyone in Medicaid programs,” and UnitedHealthcare purportedly stated DocGo had no NY contract. However, the Complaint does not plead internal reports, contemporaneous emails, meeting notes, or named witnesses showing what Capone actually knew on August 9, 2023. Still, given the operational nature of the claim (a specific enrollment number and asserted contractual channel), and Capone’s role as CEO speaking about an asserted completed operational accomplishment, the inference that he knew whether DocGo had enrolled “over 3,000” individuals is substantial.\n• Capone — CBP contract value: The Complaint alleges the contract was “worth under $2 billion” per sources and a CBP spokeswoman, and that Capone said “over $4 billion.” But it does not plead particularized facts showing Capone’s contemporaneous knowledge of the true valuation methodology, the solicitation’s ceiling/IDIQ structure, pricing assumptions, or that he had been told internally that the maximum/expected value was ≤ $2B. Absent such particulars, the allegation reads as an after-the-fact correction based on third-party sourcing.\n• DocGo, Vashovsky, Oberholzer — Educational credentials and other statements: As to these defendants, the Complaint largely relies on generalized assertions of access to information, senior positions, and “oversaw” SEC filings/proxies. It does not plead particularized facts showing Vashovsky or Oberholzer actually knew Capone’s degree claims were false when the proxy statements/8-K were issued, nor facts showing they received contrary information (e.g., due diligence results, background-check outputs, board materials). Allegations that the Board “did not verify” credentials sound in negligence, not fraudulent intent.\n\n(2) Strong inference of scienter vs. innocent explanations:\n• Capone — Educational credentials: A strong inference of scienter is adequately pleaded. Repeated, affirmative, self-referential statements about a degree he did not earn are not plausibly explained by mere mistake, particularly where the fact is binary and personal.\n• Capone — Medicaid sign-ups: The inference of scienter is plausible but not pleaded with the same particularity as the education claim because the Complaint lacks specific contemporaneous internal facts. Still, the allegation concerns a concrete number (“over 3,000”) and a specific asserted mechanism (“through UnitedHealthcare”) tied to a claimed business model shift; an innocent explanation (miscommunication, misunderstanding of what “sign up” meant) is possible and not foreclosed by particularized facts.\n• Capone — CBP contract value: Competing inferences are at least equally plausible. In government procurements, contract “value” can refer to ceiling value, potential maximum, or estimated spend; without particularized allegations about the solicitation terms and what Capone knew, an innocent inference (overstated estimate/optimism in describing pipeline) is as plausible as intentional fraud.\n• DocGo, Vashovsky, Oberholzer: The more compelling inference from the pleaded facts is inadequate diligence or internal controls regarding Capone’s résumé, not intent to deceive. The Complaint’s reliance on corporate roles, opportunity, and access to information is insufficient under the PSLRA.\n\nBecause Count I is pleaded collectively “against all defendants” and the Complaint does not plead a strong inference of scienter with particularity as to each defendant (and does not adequately plead contemporaneous knowledge for key statements as to DocGo/Vashovsky/Oberholzer, and as to Capone for the CBP valuation), the §10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed."

      "summary": "Applying the PSLRA’s heightened pleading standards, the Exchange Act claims turn on whether the Complaint pleads with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that each defendant acted with intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness at the time of the challenged statements. The Complaint alleges a multi-year channel-stuffing scheme tied to annual minimum-commitment arrangements and pleads two key confidential-witness accounts: (1) an Aptiv witness describing inability to cancel and year-end forced deliveries; and (2) a former Mobileye VP (FE2) alleging that excess inventory existed “across the board,” that the decision to push inventory “went up to Amnon” (Shashua), and that the CFO (Heller) would have been aware through quarterly executive meetings where out-of-the-ordinary customer/inventory issues were discussed. Those allegations, coupled with Mobileye’s later admissions about full-year commitments making it “impossible” for customers to adjust to demand and the disclosure of 6–7 million excess units, plausibly support scienter as to Shashua and Heller for core statements about shipment dependence on “market conditions,” inventory visibility, and the nature of customer commitments. However, as to Rojansky (CFO beginning mid-2023) and Galves (communications/IR), the Complaint largely relies on role-based “must have known” assertions and generalized corporate knowledge without particularized facts showing their actual contemporaneous knowledge of falsity when they spoke. The more compelling inference as to those defendants is negligence or post hoc awareness rather than intent or deliberate recklessness. Accordingly, the Court sustains the Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claims against Mobileye, Shashua, and Heller, but dismisses them as to Rojansky and Galves. Because Section 20(a) is derivative, it is sustained only to the extent an underlying Section 10(b) violation is adequately pleaded against the controlled person (Mobileye) and the particular control defendants (Shashua and Heller). The Securities Act claims (Sections 11 and 15) are not subject to PSLRA scienter pleading; the Complaint plausibly alleges material misstatements/omissions in the Offering Documents regarding the prevalence/impact of minimum-quantity commitments and demand/inventory trends, and thus those claims are sustained at the pleading stage.",

FE2 alleges excess inventory was significant by end of 2022, that pushing inventory to Tier 1s “went up to Amnon” (Shashua), and that executive management including the CFO attended quarterly meetings where out-of-the-ordinary Tier 1/customer report issues were discussed. FE1 describes Aptiv’s inability to cancel under minimum commitments and year-end forced deliveries, consistent with channel-stuffing. These allegations are tied to the challenged statements about shipments depending on “market conditions,” inventory monitoring/visibility, and the characterization of customer commitments as limited/exceptional. As to Rojansky and Galves, however, the Complaint does not plead comparable particularized facts showing their actual knowledge at the time of their specific statements; it largely relies on their positions, participation in communications, and later events.\n2) Strong inference: For Shashua and Heller, the inference of intent or deliberate recklessness is at least as compelling as innocent explanations because the alleged conduct involves deliberate structuring/enforcement of annual minimum commitments that (per later admissions) made it “impossible” to adjust to demand, while publicly reassuring the market that volumes depended on “market conditions” and that inventory was stabilized/being monitored. For Rojansky and Galves, innocent inferences (e.g., reliance on internal forecasts/processes, incomplete visibility, nonculpable misjudgment) are at least as plausible as fraudulent intent given the absence of particularized allegations of their contemporaneous knowledge. Therefore, Count I is sustained only as to Mobileye, Shashua, and Heller, and dismissed as to Rojansky and Galves."

The Complaint does not plead with comparable particularity that Rojansky or Galves devised, directed, or knowingly participated in the alleged channel-stuffing scheme.\n2) Strong inference: As to Shashua and Heller, the pleaded facts support a strong inference of intentional or deliberately reckless participation in a course of conduct that decoupled shipments from demand while presenting the opposite impression to investors. As to Rojansky and Galves, absent particularized facts of knowing participation in the scheme (as opposed to speaking roles), the competing inference of nonculpable conduct is at least as strong.

It further alleges Raja could ‘see the numbers’ via IATA reports and that revenue-management meetings reviewed IATA share data. Critically, it pleads an admission attributed to Isom that management ‘identified a deviation’ in revenue performance versus network peers in 1Q24 and ‘thought that was going to reverse itself’ but it did not—supporting contemporaneous awareness of underperformance during the period when the Company reaffirmed guidance and denied meaningful pushback. The April 25, 2024 earnings-call exchange (Raja stating ‘revenues are coming back very materially’ and tying that to the Q2/full-year guide; Isom denying pushback ‘at all’) is plausibly alleged to be contradicted by internal share/booking metrics and by management’s own later-described recognition of a peer deviation in 1Q24.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: Considering competing inferences, the allegations support a strong inference that at least Isom and Raja acted with at least deliberate recklessness in making specific assurances about corporate recovery, market-share retention, and guidance being ‘implicit’ in improving corporate revenues, while allegedly possessing internal metrics showing the opposite and while acknowledging internally (per later admissions) that the distribution strategy was causing softness and a peer deviation. An innocent inference—e.g., that executives merely misjudged a complex transition or believed declines were temporary—is less compelling at the pleading stage because the Complaint alleges sustained, quantified declines in key tracked metrics, repeated direct questions about corporate share/managed travel, and categorical denials/affirmations close in time to the guidance cut. The allegations are not merely ‘fraud by hindsight’; they plead contemporaneous internal indicators and a later admission that the deviation was identified during 1Q24. Accordingly, scienter is adequately pleaded as to at least some statements, and the claim survives as a whole.\n\nScope note: The Court does not hold that every challenged statement is actionable; rather, the Complaint pleads a viable 10b-5 theory based on specific late–Class Period statements (guidance reaffirmations; denials of pushback; claims corporate revenues were ‘coming back materially’) and related omissions about known adverse impacts of the distribution strategy."

It alleges, with specificity, that FE-1 (technical staff on Dominator) repeatedly raised to Defendant Giraud in meetings that Dominator and similar downspacing projects required materially higher risking; that Giraud nevertheless directed use of Concho’s historical “off the shelf” risk profile for Dominator (¶¶81–88, 360–368) and that those risk assumptions rolled into public production/financial forecasts (¶¶79–80, 90). It further alleges that once Dominator came online, Concho had “live” pressure-gauge data and daily production data showing underperformance and pressure degradation, and that “everyone at Concho knew immediately, including Defendant Giraud” (¶¶101–103, 392). These allegations are tied to specific challenged statements by Giraud/Leach about spacing being “baked into” forecasts (Oct. 31, 2018) and later statements that Concho was “seeing the results we expect” (Feb. 20, 2019) and that Dominator’s “returns look pretty good” (May 1, 2019). In addition, the complaint pleads a post-class admission attributed to Giraud that Dominator spacing was “bad” and “should’ve been caught a lot sooner” (¶¶149–152), which—while not alone sufficient—corroborates contemporaneous internal concerns.\n\nAs to Harper/Wright/Schroer, however, the complaint largely pleads scienter by virtue of titles, signing filings, and attendance at meetings, without particularized facts showing they personally received the key warnings or reviewed the specific live data at the time of their statements. PSLRA does not permit inferring knowledge solely from corporate position.\n\n2) Strong inference vs. innocent explanations: Considering the allegations holistically, the inference that Giraud (and plausibly Leach) acted at least recklessly is cogent and at least as compelling as nonfraudulent explanations. The complaint does not merely allege that Dominator later performed poorly (fraud by hindsight); it alleges contemporaneous internal warnings about improper risking and contemporaneous real-time data showing underperformance while defendants continued to represent that spacing/parent-child impacts were modeled and “baked into” forecasts and that results/returns were as expected. An innocent explanation (good-faith optimism, ordinary execution risk, or later-discovered technical failure) is weakened by the alleged directive to use legacy risk factors despite explicit internal objections and by the alleged immediate availability of contrary performance indicators. Accordingly, scienter is adequately pleaded as to Concho and, at minimum, Giraud and Leach. The claim is sustained, but only to the extent predicated on statements attributable to defendants for whom scienter is sufficiently pleaded; to the extent Count I is asserted against Harper, Wright, and Schroer as primary violators, it is dismissed for failure to plead particularized scienter."
