      "summary": "The complaint fails to plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the PSLRA. Allegations rely on confidential witness accounts of general trends known to lower-level employees, access to data (not specific contemporaneous knowledge by Individual Defendants), core operations theory, and post-Class Period admissions, which constitute fraud by hindsight, speculation, and group pleading. Innocent explanations—optimistic business judgment on an aggressive strategy with expected short-term disruptions—are at least equally plausible. Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim dismissed; Section 20(a) claim dismissed as derivative.",

          "scienter_analysis": "No particularized allegations that any Individual Defendant had actual contemporaneous knowledge of falsity at the time of specific statements. CW accounts describe declines observed by sales personnel with chain-of-command access to Raja, but no evidence Defendants personally reviewed adverse PRISM/SalesLink/IATA data showing statements false when made. Statements of being 'encouraged' are subjective puffery or forward-looking. Post-period admissions (e.g., Q1 2024 deviation 'hoped would reverse') show at worst poor judgment, not intent/recklessness. General access, core operations, evasive answers, and Bain review do not create strong inference over plausible non-culpable explanations."
