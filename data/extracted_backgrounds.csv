Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period, Defendant Jenkins sold 336,929 shares, nearly 34% of his holdings, at artificially inflated prices for proceeds of $79,246,195. (Id.) Defendant Ryan Keeton is a co-founder of Carvana and serves as its Chief Brand Officer. (Id. ¶ 24.) During the Class Period, Plaintiffs allege Keeton sold 180,007 shares of Carvana stock, or nearly 63% of his stock, at artificially inflated prices for proceeds of more than $42.3 million. (Id.) Defendant Benjamin Huston is a co-founder of Carvana and serves as its Chief Operating Officer. (Id. ¶ 25.)

Underwriter Defendants Plaintiffs allege Defendants Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as underwriters and/or underwriter representatives of, and as sellers in, Carvana’s 2022 Public Offering (collectively, the “Underwriter Defendants”). (Id. ¶ 416.) Plaintiffs allege that in connection with the 2022 Public Offering, the Underwriter Defendants marketed Carvana common stock to potential investors using materially false or misleading information about the Company, or omitted material information required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement. (Id. ¶ 417.) Plaintiffs also allege that the Underwriter Defendants caused the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC and to be declared effective in connection with the 2022 Public Offering. (Id.) Plaintiffs claim this conduct deems them liable under the Securities Act. (Id.) B. Carvana’s Founding & Business Model Plaintiffs allege that Garcia Senior and his son, Garcia Junior—along with Keeton and Huston—founded Carvana as a wholly owned subsidiary of DriveTime Automotive (“DriveTime”), which was Garcia Senior’s used car business. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 39, 41.) Carvana described itself as an “e-commerce company dealing in used cars” and “the Amazon of the used car industry.” (Id. ¶ 2.) In 2017, the Garcias took Carvana public on the NYSE and pitched it as “a disrupter and innovator in the used car market.” (Id. ¶ 41.) The Consolidated Complaint alleges Carvana marketed itself as a “seemingly limitless growth machine because the Company’s disruptive model was full of competitive advantages, such as a ‘capital-light’ expansion model, a scalable business model, and a groundbreaking logistics network that could readily deliver or pick-up cars nationwide.” (Id. ¶ 2.) The Exchange Act Defendants marketed to investors that Carvana’s “business gets better as it gets bigger.” (Id.) Garcia Junior advertised that “a unique attribute of our business model relative to automotive retail and then not unique relative to e-commerce is that all of our cars are available to customers everywhere” and “you’re increasing conversion across all of your markets . . . we feel really, really good about that model.” (Id. ¶ 55.) Carvana held its “first and only Analyst Day” on November 29, 2018. (Id. ¶ 53.) There, Garcia Junior broadcasted that Carvana’s “long-term goal was to sell two million- plus units a year to become the largest automotive retailer.” (Id.) Plaintiffs further allege the Exchange Act Defendants touted to analysts and investors that Carvana sought to become the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. (Id.) Jenkins then explained that Carvana’s goal—to be the largest and most profitable automotive retailer—was attainable. (Id.) Jenkins explained that “the scalability of the online sales model, we believe, will lead to being a larger industry player than we’ve historically seen in automotive retail and more profitable player than we’ve historically seen due to a long- term lower cost structure.” (Id. (cleaned up).) The Consolidated Complaint further alleges that the Exchange Act Defendants touted to investors that Carvana could achieve its “lofty goals” due to its innovative business model. (Id. ¶ 54.) Specifically, the Exchange Act Defendants explained that “unlike traditional dealerships, Carvana’s e-commerce model offered structural cost advantages that enabled the Company to become more profitable as it grew in scale.” (Id.) C. Carvana’s Stock Price Decline Leading up to the Class Period, Carvana’s growth slowed and its stock price declined. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 134.) The Consolidated Complaint alleges that analysts expressed alarm. (Id. ¶ 134.) On February 27, 2020, for example, Morgan Stanley reported that: “If the growth starts to slow significantly, and the company is still not profitable, there will be a transition away from growth investors, and we believe that how investors think about the valuation of the stock will change.” (Id.)

cand-3_21-cv-09767.pdf,cand,72862,16641,16369,"A. Overview 1. Robinhood Robinhood is a financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Docket No. 92 (“SAC”) ¶ 2. The company provides a trading platform wherein its customers engage with the financial markets through an application and user interface. SAC ¶¶ 2, 53. Robinhood’s primary customer base is retail investors, many of whom are first-time investors. Id. ¶ 53. Namely, Robinhood’s core product offerings include ability to trade in United States Stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (“EFTs”) and American Depository Receipts (“ADRS”) and to trade i cryptocurrencies. Id. Robinhood is a commission-free broker that earns revenue through a “payment for order flow” (“PFOF”) practice, where it primarily earns revenue by routing customer si r transactions on its app to market makers in exchange for payments. Id. ¶ 54. For cryptocurrency trading, the consideration Robinhood earns is called “Transaction Rebates.” Id. Collectively, these earnings are referred to as “transaction-based revenue.” Id. Transaction-based revenue accounted for the majority of Robinhood’s revenue (75% in FY 2020 and 80.5% in January through March (Q1) 2021). Id. 2. Robinhood’s IPO On July 30, 2021, Robinhood conducted an initial public offering (“IPO”) and offered million shares of common stock to the public at a price of $38 per share for proceeds of over $2 billion. SAC ¶ 3. Prior to the IPO, Robinhood released the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, the “Offering Documents”). SAC ¶ 1; MTD, Ex. 1 (Registration Statement); Ex. 2 (Prospectus). Plaintiffs allege that the Offering Documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omitted material information that was required by law to be disclosed in violation of §§11, 12, and of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Items 105 and 303 of applicable SEC Regulations (Reg. S-K). SAC ¶¶ 1, 131-. 3. The meme stock and Dogecoin events Robinhood’s IPO came on the heels of a series of events in early 2021 that have come to be publicly known as the “meme stock” and “Dogecoin” events. Specifically, from mid-January to early February, the prices of GameStop Corp. (“GME”), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“AMC”) and certain other stocks skyrocketed. SAC ¶ 72. The frenzy took off in part because of retail investors banding together in places like Reddit (under the subreddit r/WallStreetBets), to squeeze short-sellers who had bet against these companies. Id. To illustrate the extent of this event, the stock of AMC jumped 300% on one day alone, and Bed Bath & Beyond’s shares rose 43% the same day. Id. ¶ 75. The price of GME also skyrocketed. Id. Plaintiffs allege that the meme stock event ended, and the stocks “fell from their unprecedented January highs,” and trading volume declined below “extraordinary levels” seen during the event. Id. ¶ 77. By the time the meme stock event waned, the company began seeing a huge pick up in the trading of a cryptocurrency, the Dogecoin. Id. ¶ 79. Specifically, the price of Dogecoin skyrocketed in April after it gained “cult status” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets message board. Id. ¶¶ 79-80. The spike lasted from January to May 2021, wherein Robinhood experienced a large increase in cryptocurrency trading on the platform, increasing its revenue from trading of the currency alongside the Dogecoin event. Id. ¶¶ 78-82. To illustrate how substantial the Dogecoin event was, during that time, the value of the Dogecoin increased from half of a cent to cents at its height. Id. ¶¶ 79, 81. All in all, Robinhood experienced a 50% quarter-over- quarter increase in revenue from equities and options trading from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and an increase in revenue from cryptocurrency trading from $12 million in Q4 2020 to $87.5 million during the initial stage of the Dogecoin rally. Id. ¶ 82. Plaintiffs describe these amounts as “all- time highs” for the company. Id. However, these trading volumes in “meme stocks” fell after the unprecedented highs in early Q1 as the trading craze subsided, and the large spike in cryptocurrency trading surrounding Dogecoin likewise fell throughout Q2 2021. Id. ¶¶ 77, 84. B. Procedural History Plaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on December 17, 2021, under §§ 11, 12, and of the Securities Act. Docket No. 1. After the lead plaintiffs were appointed, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint. Docket No. 75 (“FAC”). Plaintiffs alleged that the Offering Documents filed in connection with Robinhood’s IPO contained materially false and misleading statements and material omissions. FAC ¶ 1. August 18, 2022, Robinhood filed a motion to dismiss the FAC. Docket No. 78 16 (“MTD”). Robinhood argued that none of its business strategy statements or risk factor statements ee were false or misleading, and that the Offering Documents accurately disclosed Robinhood’s N financial performance. MTD at 10–25. The Court granted Robinhood’s MTD with leave to amend. Docket No. 90. The Court determined that the Plaintiffs failed to plead a violation of Section or Section 12(a) of the Securities Act. Id. at 8-17, 19-20. Specifically, Plaintiffs did not allege inaccuracies in the Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) that Robinhood reported. Id. at 10. Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants had access to intra-quarterly results that showed a decline in its KPIs in months leading up to the company’s IPO that were inconsistent with the KPIs reported in the Offering Documents. Id. at 6. However, as a general matter, Defendants had no obligation to disclose incomplete intra-quarterly results (May to July 2021) because SEC regulations do not require the disclosure of interim quarterly results. Id. at 11 (citations omitted). Rather, disclosure would only be required where disclosing the intra-quarterly results would be “necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.” Id. at 11 (citations omitted). The Complaint did not “provide contextual information that would show the [out-of-quarter] declines to be unusual and indicative of larger future trends.” Id. at 11. “Without historical data to show that the May to July 2021 [KPI declines] were exceptional and out of line with past fluctuations, that data is not so extraordinary as to mandate specific out-of- quarter disclosure.” Id. at 12. And further, while the complaint alleged a large decline in trading of cryptocurrency, the allegations did not show that Robinhood suffered unique declines compared to a general trend in the industry which would have been known by the public and any reasonable investor. Id. Additionally, Robinhood disclosed future risks and downward trends of the metrics that they published, negating liability via omission. Id. Namely, Robinhood warned in its Offering Documents that historical data of KPI growth was not necessarily indicative of future performance; in fact, Robinhood reported that it expected growth rates of KPIs to decline significantly in future periods. Id. The Court also found that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Act based upon allegations that Robinhood mispresented its business strategies. The Court reasoned that such statements are vague statements of corporate optimism which are not ee actionable under the Act. Id. at 18. N Accordingly, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under §§ and of the Securities Act for omitting intra-quarterly reports showing downward trends in KPIs. Id. at 20. The Court granted leave to amend to add allegations stating a claim, for example: [A]llegations of specific contextual information demonstrating that the decline in KPI and cryptocurrency trading levels in the two to three months before the filing of the Offering Documents were extraordinary and indicative of larger future trends known to the management or through which management should have known would have a material impact on future performance and which were not adequately disclosed. Id. Thus, for Plaintiffs to have successfully amended their complaint, they needed to provide allegations giving specific contextual information demonstrating the decline in KPI and cryptocurrency trading levels for Robinhood specifically in the 2-months before the filing of the Offering Documents (May to July 2021) were extraordinary and indicative of a larger future trend sufficient to trigger out-of-quarter and intra-quarter reporting. C. Updated allegations in the SAC 1. First Amended Complaint As described above, in Plaintiffs’ (now dismissed) FAC they alleged that the company issued an IPO based upon a revolutionary strategy of focusing on young and non-traditional investors. FAC ¶¶ 3-13. The Registration Statement became effective on July 28, 2021, and the company’s IPO was priced at $38, and the final Prospectus for the IPO was filed on July 30, 2021 (the “Offering Documents”). FAC ¶¶ 88-91. Plaintiffs alleged that the company represented in the Offering Documents that it would focus on safety and reliability, needs of small investors, and radical feedback. Id. ¶¶ 3-13, 92-128. However, by the time the company issued its IPO, Plaintiffs alleged it had abandoned those principles and was failing to cater to the needs of its investors as shown in its security issues, failure to react to customer feedback, issues with fraud, and disruption to its platforms. Id. This failure in strategy, Plaintiffs argue, was reflected in Robinhood’s data, i.e., its declining KPI metrics from May to July 2021, in contrast to its steadily ee positive KPIs in the year prior. Id. ¶¶ 5-8, 129-139. Those KPIs were omitted from the Offering N Documents. Id. Namely, the FAC alleged that the Offering Documents reported positive KPIs from December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2020. FAC ¶¶ 5-8. Specifically, Robinhood’s Monthly Active Users (“MAU”) steadily increased. Id. ¶ 5. As did its total revenue, assets under custody (“AUC”) and net cumulative funded accounts. FAC ¶¶ 6-8. However, in the few months from May 2021 to July 2021, just before the IPO, these metrics started declining. Specifically: • MAU declined by 4.6 million users between May 2021 and July 2021 (a 19% decline), FAC ¶ 129; (11.62% between May and June and 8.45% between June and July 2021). • Total cryptocurrency trading volume declined by $97 billion in from May to June 2021 (a 76% decline) and $17 billion in July 2021 (an additional 56.67% decline), FAC ¶ 131–32. • AUC declined by $7.3 billion from June 2021 to July 2021 (a 7% decline), FAC ¶ 135. • ARPU (average revenues per user) declined from $137 to $65 between March 2021 and September 2021 (a 53% decline), FAC ¶ 134. The Court notes that September 2021 is beyond the effective date of the Offering Documents. Plaintiffs alleged that Robinhood had the ability to analyze its performance data immediately through the data platform Looker and that executives discussed the declining performance at the weekly all-hands meetings. FAC ¶¶ 12–13, 87, 108, 118–19. However, Robinhood did not disclose this data in its Offering Documents which included its company strategy that had since been abandoned, rendering the Offering Documents misleading. 2. Second Amended Complaint In Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, they allege that Robinhood’s Offering Documents were misleading because they misrepresented the company’s state of affairs as it existed at the time of the IPO. SAC ¶¶ 1–10. Namely, Robinhood allegedly represented the company was successfully executing a strategy of making investing available to an untapped market of small and non-traditional investors. Id. ¶¶ 1–7. To this end, Robinhood included historical performance data in its Offering Documents to evidence that it had been driving growth and was positioned to keep on growing. Id. However, by the time of the IPO, Robinhood’s “core ee fundamentals” allegedly changed. Id. ¶ 4. Specifically, in 2021 Robinhood’s largest source of N revenue “was no longer fees from its customers’ conventional trading in stocks and options, as it had been previously.” SAC ¶ 108. Rather, Robinhood’s revenue shifted to being driven by “speculative, fad-trading in meme stocks and the novelty cryptocurrency Dogecoin.” Id. This change in fundamentals was not viable, as was represented by its declining intra-quarterly reports. Id. In other words, its fundamentals changed in that: (1) Robinhood’s source of revenue shifted leading up to the IPO and this was not disclosed in the Offering Documents; and (2) the negative nature of this fundamental shift was evident from data available to Defendants in real time (intra- quarterly reports) that it did not disclose. Id. ¶¶ 4–6. In this vein, Plaintiffs allege that a chart identifying historical quarterly net and transaction- based revenue from Q1 2019 through Q1 2021, and statements made about that revenue, along with a chart identifying sources of transaction-based revenue through Q1 2021 are untrue or rendered misleading because they omitted material facts. SAC ¶¶ 110–13, 15. Plaintiffs also allege that tables included in the Offering Documents reflecting growth in Net Cumulative Funded Accounts (NCFA) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) from 2014 though Q1 2021 and 2017 through Q1, respectively, were rendered false or materially misleading because Robinhood’s core fundamentals had changed (i.e., its revenue composition changed and its KPIs were declining) and specifically because MAU, ARPU and AUC declined prior to the IPO. Id. ¶¶ 119, 122. Plaintiffs also allege that statements made regarding risk factors and/or warnings were inadequate or false and misleading. Id. ¶¶ 127-30. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the following information was known to Defendants but was not included in the Offering Documents, rendering the above misleading. a. Shift in composition of revenue Plaintiffs allege that revenue from cryptocurrency trades became the company’s main source of revenue by the time of the IPO, but investors were unaware of this because there was no breakdown of revenue type for the Q2 preliminary metrics, as opposed to prior quarters. SAC ¶ 6. Q1, revenue from cryptocurrency trading rose to 21% of all revenue. Id. ¶ 57. Prior to Q1 15 2021, a majority of the company’s revenue came from the conventional trading of stocks, equities, and options. Id. ¶ 56. ee 17 b. Intra-quarterly reports regarding revenue and trading volumes and KPIs N Plaintiffs allege that equities revenue and trading volume dropped significantly from Q1 to Q2. Specifically, equities trading revenue declined 61%, when before it was one third of all transaction-based revenue. SAC ¶ 5. And further, equities trading volume declined 33% from June 2021 to July 2021. Id. Further, cryptocurrency revenue and trading volume dropped 90% from Q2 to the beginning of Q3. SAC ¶¶ 6, 84. Plaintiffs allege that as to revenue, aside from one quarter in Q4 2019, revenue mostly grew quarter-over-quarter from Q1 2019 to Q1 2021. Id. ¶ 55. Plaintiffs allege that there were declines in KPIs, specifically in MAU, AUC, and ARPU, from Q2 to Q3 that were not disclosed in the Offering Documents and that these drops were “unusual” compared to historical financial information. SAC ¶ 7. Plaintiffs also allege that each of the KPIs when viewed in conjunction with the other drops in KPIs and alongside the reduction in revenue were material. SAC ¶¶ 7, 99, 103, 105. • MAU (Monthly Active Users): Plaintiffs allege that MAU dropped about 19% from May to July, including an 11.65% decline from May to June and an additional 8.45% decline from June to July. SAC ¶¶ 7, 98-99. Plaintiffs allege that the MAU drops were “highly material” because the decline was “considerable” and that they were “highly unusual” because Robinhood had “rarely, if ever, experienced back-to-back months of declining MAU of similar magnitude.” Id. ¶ 99. si r • AUC (Assets Under Custody), which is the sum of the fair value of equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, had declined 7% from June to July and, aside from a bump in June, had been declining since May. SAC ¶¶ 7, 103-104. Plaintiffs allege that this decline stood “in stark contrast to the unbroken string of rising AUC that occurred prior to July 2021.” Id. ¶ 103. • ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) dropped nearly 20% from Q1 to the end of Q2. Id. ¶¶ 7, 100. Although the Offering Documents provided preliminary estimates of KPIs for Q2, they did not do so for ARPU. Id. ¶ 101. • NCFA (Monthly Net Cumulative Funded Accounts): NCFA reflecting customer base and a usage remained largely flat from May through July 2021. Id. ¶¶ 7, 106.","A. Overview 1. Robinhood Robinhood is a financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Docket No. 92 (“SAC”) ¶ 2. The company provides a trading platform wherein its customers engage with the financial markets through an application and user interface. SAC ¶¶ 2, 53. Robinhood’s primary customer base is retail investors, many of whom are first-time investors. Namely, Robinhood’s core product offerings include ability to trade in United States Stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (“EFTs”) and American Depository Receipts (“ADRS”) and to trade i cryptocurrencies. Id. Robinhood is a commission-free broker that earns revenue through a “payment for order flow” (“PFOF”) practice, where it primarily earns revenue by routing customer si r transactions on its app to market makers in exchange for payments. For cryptocurrency trading, the consideration Robinhood earns is called “Transaction Rebates.” Id. Collectively, these earnings are referred to as “transaction-based revenue.” Id. Transaction-based revenue accounted for the majority of Robinhood’s revenue (75% in FY 2020 and 80.5% in January through March (Q1) 2021). Id. 2. Robinhood’s IPO On July 30, 2021, Robinhood conducted an initial public offering (“IPO”) and offered million shares of common stock to the public at a price of $38 per share for proceeds of over $2 billion. SAC ¶ 3. Prior to the IPO, Robinhood released the Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, the “Offering Documents”). SAC ¶ 1; MTD, Ex. 1 (Registration Statement); Ex. 2 (Prospectus). Plaintiffs allege that the Offering Documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omitted material information that was required by law to be disclosed in violation of §§11, 12, and of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Items 105 and 303 of applicable SEC Regulations (Reg. S-K). SAC ¶¶ 1, 131-. 3. The meme stock and Dogecoin events Robinhood’s IPO came on the heels of a series of events in early 2021 that have come to be publicly known as the “meme stock” and “Dogecoin” events. Specifically, from mid-January to early February, the prices of GameStop Corp. (“GME”), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“AMC”) and certain other stocks skyrocketed. SAC ¶ 72. The frenzy took off in part because of retail investors banding together in places like Reddit (under the subreddit r/WallStreetBets), to squeeze short-sellers who had bet against these companies. Id. To illustrate the extent of this event, the stock of AMC jumped 300% on one day alone, and Bed Bath & Beyond’s shares rose 43% the same day. The price of GME also skyrocketed. Id. Plaintiffs allege that the meme stock event ended, and the stocks “fell from their unprecedented January highs,” and trading volume declined below “extraordinary levels” seen during the event. By the time the meme stock event waned, the company began seeing a huge pick up in the trading of a cryptocurrency, the Dogecoin. Specifically, the price of Dogecoin skyrocketed in April after it gained “cult status” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets message board. The spike lasted from January to May 2021, wherein Robinhood experienced a large increase in cryptocurrency trading on the platform, increasing its revenue from trading of the currency alongside the Dogecoin event. To illustrate how substantial the Dogecoin event was, during that time, the value of the Dogecoin increased from half of a cent to cents at its height. , 81. All in all, Robinhood experienced a 50% quarter-over- quarter increase in revenue from equities and options trading from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and an increase in revenue from cryptocurrency trading from $12 million in Q4 2020 to $87.5 million during the initial stage of the Dogecoin rally. Plaintiffs describe these amounts as “all- time highs” for the company. Id. However, these trading volumes in “meme stocks” fell after the unprecedented highs in early Q1 as the trading craze subsided, and the large spike in cryptocurrency trading surrounding Dogecoin likewise fell throughout Q2 2021. , 84. B. Procedural History Plaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on December 17, 2021, under §§ 11, 12, and of the Securities Act. Docket No. 1. After the lead plaintiffs were appointed, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint. Docket No. 75 (“FAC”). Plaintiffs alleged that the Offering Documents filed in connection with Robinhood’s IPO contained materially false and misleading statements and material omissions. FAC ¶ 1. August 18, 2022, Robinhood filed a motion to dismiss the FAC. Docket No. 78 16 (“MTD”). Robinhood argued that none of its business strategy statements or risk factor statements ee were false or misleading, and that the Offering Documents accurately disclosed Robinhood’s N financial performance. MTD at 10–25. The Court granted Robinhood’s MTD with leave to amend. Docket No. 90. The Court determined that the Plaintiffs failed to plead a violation of Section or Section 12(a) of the Securities Act. Id. at 8-17, 19-20. Specifically, Plaintiffs did not allege inaccuracies in the Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) that Robinhood reported. Id. at 10. Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants had access to intra-quarterly results that showed a decline in its KPIs in months leading up to the company’s IPO that were inconsistent with the KPIs reported in the Offering Documents. Id. at 6. However, as a general matter, Defendants had no obligation to disclose incomplete intra-quarterly results (May to July 2021) because SEC regulations do not require the disclosure of interim quarterly results. Id. at 11 (citations omitted). Rather, disclosure would only be required where disclosing the intra-quarterly results would be “necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.” Id. at 11 (citations omitted). The Complaint did not “provide contextual information that would show the [out-of-quarter] declines to be unusual and indicative of larger future trends.” Id. at 11. “Without historical data to show that the May to July 2021 [KPI declines] were exceptional and out of line with past fluctuations, that data is not so extraordinary as to mandate specific out-of- quarter disclosure.” Id. at 12. And further, while the complaint alleged a large decline in trading of cryptocurrency, the allegations did not show that Robinhood suffered unique declines compared to a general trend in the industry which would have been known by the public and any reasonable investor. Id. Additionally, Robinhood disclosed future risks and downward trends of the metrics that they published, negating liability via omission. Id. Namely, Robinhood warned in its Offering Documents that historical data of KPI growth was not necessarily indicative of future performance; in fact, Robinhood reported that it expected growth rates of KPIs to decline significantly in future periods. Id. The Court also found that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Act based upon allegations that Robinhood mispresented its business strategies. The Court reasoned that such statements are vague statements of corporate optimism which are not ee actionable under the Act. Id. at 18. N Accordingly, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under §§ and of the Securities Act for omitting intra-quarterly reports showing downward trends in KPIs. Id. at 20. The Court granted leave to amend to add allegations stating a claim, for example: [A]llegations of specific contextual information demonstrating that the decline in KPI and cryptocurrency trading levels in the two to three months before the filing of the Offering Documents were extraordinary and indicative of larger future trends known to the management or through which management should have known would have a material impact on future performance and which were not adequately disclosed. Id. Thus, for Plaintiffs to have successfully amended their complaint, they needed to provide allegations giving specific contextual information demonstrating the decline in KPI and cryptocurrency trading levels for Robinhood specifically in the 2-months before the filing of the Offering Documents (May to July 2021) were extraordinary and indicative of a larger future trend sufficient to trigger out-of-quarter and intra-quarter reporting. C. Updated allegations in the SAC 1. First Amended Complaint As described above, in Plaintiffs’ (now dismissed) FAC they alleged that the company issued an IPO based upon a revolutionary strategy of focusing on young and non-traditional investors. FAC ¶¶ 3-13. The Registration Statement became effective on July 28, 2021, and the company’s IPO was priced at $38, and the final Prospectus for the IPO was filed on July 30, 2021 (the “Offering Documents”). FAC ¶¶ 88-91. Plaintiffs alleged that the company represented in the Offering Documents that it would focus on safety and reliability, needs of small investors, and radical feedback. , 92-128. However, by the time the company issued its IPO, Plaintiffs alleged it had abandoned those principles and was failing to cater to the needs of its investors as shown in its security issues, failure to react to customer feedback, issues with fraud, and disruption to its platforms. Id. This failure in strategy, Plaintiffs argue, was reflected in Robinhood’s data, i.e., its declining KPI metrics from May to July 2021, in contrast to its steadily ee positive KPIs in the year prior. , 129-139. Those KPIs were omitted from the Offering N Documents. Id. Namely, the FAC alleged that the Offering Documents reported positive KPIs from December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2020. FAC ¶¶ 5-8. Specifically, Robinhood’s Monthly Active Users (“MAU”) steadily increased. As did its total revenue, assets under custody (“AUC”) and net cumulative funded accounts. FAC ¶¶ 6-8. However, in the few months from May 2021 to July 2021, just before the IPO, these metrics started declining. Specifically: • MAU declined by 4.6 million users between May 2021 and July 2021 (a 19% decline), FAC ¶ 129; (11.62% between May and June and 8.45% between June and July 2021). • Total cryptocurrency trading volume declined by $97 billion in from May to June 2021 (a 76% decline) and $17 billion in July 2021 (an additional 56.67% decline), FAC ¶ 131–32. • AUC declined by $7.3 billion from June 2021 to July 2021 (a 7% decline), FAC ¶ 135. • ARPU (average revenues per user) declined from $137 to $65 between March 2021 and September 2021 (a 53% decline), FAC ¶ 134. The Court notes that September 2021 is beyond the effective date of the Offering Documents. Plaintiffs alleged that Robinhood had the ability to analyze its performance data immediately through the data platform Looker and that executives discussed the declining performance at the weekly all-hands meetings. FAC ¶¶ 12–13, 87, 108, 118–19. However, Robinhood did not disclose this data in its Offering Documents which included its company strategy that had since been abandoned, rendering the Offering Documents misleading. 2. Second Amended Complaint In Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, they allege that Robinhood’s Offering Documents were misleading because they misrepresented the company’s state of affairs as it existed at the time of the IPO. SAC ¶¶ 1–10. Namely, Robinhood allegedly represented the company was successfully executing a strategy of making investing available to an untapped market of small and non-traditional investors. To this end, Robinhood included historical performance data in its Offering Documents to evidence that it had been driving growth and was positioned to keep on growing. Id. However, by the time of the IPO, Robinhood’s “core ee fundamentals” allegedly changed. Specifically, in 2021 Robinhood’s largest source of N revenue “was no longer fees from its customers’ conventional trading in stocks and options, as it had been previously.” SAC ¶ 108. Rather, Robinhood’s revenue shifted to being driven by “speculative, fad-trading in meme stocks and the novelty cryptocurrency Dogecoin.” Id. This change in fundamentals was not viable, as was represented by its declining intra-quarterly reports. Id. In other words, its fundamentals changed in that: (1) Robinhood’s source of revenue shifted leading up to the IPO and this was not disclosed in the Offering Documents; and (2) the negative nature of this fundamental shift was evident from data available to Defendants in real time (intra- quarterly reports) that it did not disclose. In this vein, Plaintiffs allege that a chart identifying historical quarterly net and transaction- based revenue from Q1 2019 through Q1 2021, and statements made about that revenue, along with a chart identifying sources of transaction-based revenue through Q1 2021 are untrue or rendered misleading because they omitted material facts. SAC ¶¶ 110–13, 15. Plaintiffs also allege that tables included in the Offering Documents reflecting growth in Net Cumulative Funded Accounts (NCFA) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) from 2014 though Q1 2021 and 2017 through Q1, respectively, were rendered false or materially misleading because Robinhood’s core fundamentals had changed (i.e., its revenue composition changed and its KPIs were declining) and specifically because MAU, ARPU and AUC declined prior to the IPO. , 122. Plaintiffs also allege that statements made regarding risk factors and/or warnings were inadequate or false and misleading. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the following information was known to Defendants but was not included in the Offering Documents, rendering the above misleading. a. Shift in composition of revenue Plaintiffs allege that revenue from cryptocurrency trades became the company’s main source of revenue by the time of the IPO, but investors were unaware of this because there was no breakdown of revenue type for the Q2 preliminary metrics, as opposed to prior quarters. SAC ¶ 6. Q1, revenue from cryptocurrency trading rose to 21% of all revenue. Prior to Q1 15 2021, a majority of the company’s revenue came from the conventional trading of stocks, equities, and options. ee 17 b. Intra-quarterly reports regarding revenue and trading volumes and KPIs N Plaintiffs allege that equities revenue and trading volume dropped significantly from Q1 to Q2. Specifically, equities trading revenue declined 61%, when before it was one third of all transaction-based revenue. SAC ¶ 5. And further, equities trading volume declined 33% from June 2021 to July 2021. Id. Further, cryptocurrency revenue and trading volume dropped 90% from Q2 to the beginning of Q3. SAC ¶¶ 6, 84. Plaintiffs allege that as to revenue, aside from one quarter in Q4 2019, revenue mostly grew quarter-over-quarter from Q1 2019 to Q1 2021. Plaintiffs allege that there were declines in KPIs, specifically in MAU, AUC, and ARPU, from Q2 to Q3 that were not disclosed in the Offering Documents and that these drops were “unusual” compared to historical financial information. SAC ¶ 7. Plaintiffs also allege that each of the KPIs when viewed in conjunction with the other drops in KPIs and alongside the reduction in revenue were material. SAC ¶¶ 7, 99, 103, 105. • MAU (Monthly Active Users): Plaintiffs allege that MAU dropped about 19% from May to July, including an 11.65% decline from May to June and an additional 8.45% decline from June to July. SAC ¶¶ 7, 98-99. Plaintiffs allege that the MAU drops were “highly material” because the decline was “considerable” and that they were “highly unusual” because Robinhood had “rarely, if ever, experienced back-to-back months of declining MAU of similar magnitude.” si r • AUC (Assets Under Custody), which is the sum of the fair value of equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, had declined 7% from June to July and, aside from a bump in June, had been declining since May.

Plaintiffs allege that this decline stood “in stark contrast to the unbroken string of rising AUC that occurred prior to July 2021.” • ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) dropped nearly 20% from Q1 to the end of Q2. , 100. Although the Offering Documents provided preliminary estimates of KPIs for Q2, they did not do so for ARPU. • NCFA (Monthly Net Cumulative Funded Accounts): NCFA reflecting customer base and a usage remained largely flat from May through July 2021. , 106."
cand-3_22-cv-00105.pdf,cand,112671,28483,27920,"I. Factual Background Talis is a biotechnology company that was founded in 2010 to develop point-of-care 16 (“POC”) diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. CC ¶ 27.1 Talis developed the Talis One System, ee 17 a diagnostic platform comprised of (1) single-use test cartridges that prepare and store patient N samples, (2) a box-shaped instrument that analyzes the samples, and (3) software. Id. ¶¶ 34-35; Defs’ Request for Judicial Notice Ex. B at 2-(Excerpts from Talis’s Final Amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2021).2 In 2018, Talis was developing rapid POC diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted infections (“STIs”) such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. CC ¶ 28. After the onset of the COVID-pandemic in early 2020, Talis abandoned its original focus on STI testing, and by summer 2020 started to Talis was originally named SlipChip LLC. POC testing “refers to medical diagnostic testing that takes place at or near the time and place of patient care, rather than in a central laboratory.” Id. As discussed infra, the Court grants defendants’ request for consideration of this document as well as several others under the “incorporation by reference” doctrine. develop a molecular test for COVID-19. Id. ¶¶ 28, 32.3 Talis’s COVID-test was slated to be the source of “[s]ubstantially all” of Talis’s initial revenue. Id. ¶ 216. A. IPO/Registration Statement By late 2020, Talis was moving to conduct an IPO. Plaintiffs allege that defendants were motivated to do so because Talis was required to issue a “going concern” warning in October 2020. Id. ¶ 38. Talis’s first draft registration statement, which was confidentially filed with the SEC on October 15, 2020, stated “Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” Id.4 Talis also sought to capitalize on a rapidly closing window to sell a new COVID-test before demand cooled due to the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-vaccines in December 2020, and before competing tests captured the market. Id. ¶ 40. Talis would need to persuade investors that its product provided fast, accurate, reliable results and could be ee manufactured at scale. Id. ¶¶ 35, 40-41. N Talis conducted its IPO on February 11, 2021. Id. ¶ 72. Shares of Talis common stock were offered at $16 per share, and the IPO raised $253.9 million. Id. Plaintiffs allege that the Registration Statement was false and misleading because (1) Talis was not capable of producing Talis One to scale; (2) the Talis One was non-functional due to design issues; and (3) Talis had botched its crucial application for an EUA from the FDA. The CC explains that there “are two basic types of COVID-diagnostic tests. Antigen tests (like those widely available at drugstores) detect specific viral proteins (antigens), but provide only a simple “yes” or “no” and sacrifice accuracy for speed. By contrast, molecular diagnostic tests amplify genetic material to detect viral nucleic acid (viral RNA), offering greater accuracy but generally lower speed than antigen tests.” Id. Talis temporarily staved off its auditor’s “going concern” warning by raising $126 million in private financing in November 2020. Id. ¶ 39. 1. Manufacturing Issues When Talis pivoted from its original focus on STI testing to COVID-testing, it substantially accelerated its timeline for bringing Talis One to market. Id. ¶ 43. According to FE- 1,5 a former Talis R&D engineer who worked at Talis from August 2016 to March 2021, “had COVID not happened, the original cartridge for STI testing was slated to go into production in 2022.” Id. Plaintiffs allege that Talis did not have a realistic timeline to manufacture the Talis One and that the process was plagued by production problems: 45. . . . FE-2—a senior scientist with a Ph.D. in molecular genetics—confirmed that Talis did not have a realistic timeline to manufacture its product, let alone bring it to market. Indeed, FE-explained that for much of the period when FE-worked at Talis (February to October 2020), Talis only had one person and a supporting technician working on the COVID-test, but was aggressively applying for grants. FE-described an amalgamation of incompetency at every level within the Company – marketing, alignment with R&D, and even creating a plan or timeline. 46. Similarly, FE-3—an engineer who worked at Talis for over four years before the a IPO—stated that Talis’s timelines were overly aggressive, citing company culture as one of the drivers. When FE-mentioned concerns about the overly aggressive timelines to a scientific advisor on Talis’s Board, the advisor responded that the t l a aggressive timelines were “inspirational.” FE-was infuriated and thought the timelines had no basis. 15 47. In the view of FE-1, a senior mechanical R&D engineer, Talis management t. - t d n r model. FE-further explained that to go from prototype to full production at th volume—a 100-fold increase—was not possible at the time of the IPO. 48. Overall, FE-said that the combination of manufacturing, design, and supply chain issues was like running without your pants pulled up all the way. In the second quarter of 2020, FE-raised flags, especially about an issue with leaking cartridges that only began to be fixed in December of 2020, after being known for a year. Management knew about the leaking cartridges, FE-stated, because Talis had conducted a user study and the feedback was given to all of management. 49. FE-also highlighted Tony Cunningham, the senior director of supply chain starting in July 2020. Starting around August 2020, FE-spoke directly about supply issues to Cunningham, who reported to CFO Roger Moody, but Cunningham ignored and downplayed FE-1’s concerns. FE-also explained that Talis’s executive team knew what was being purchased and they knew the testing results. 50. Talis was also significantly behind its internal deadlines shortly before the February 2021 IPO. FE-explained that Cunningham posted a weekly schedule of production that indicated a Q4 2020 goal of producing 1,000 instruments for beta The CC relies on five confidential witnesses who are former employees (“FE”) of Talis. testing and to prove Talis’s manufacturing capability, but Talis produced far fewer instruments in the quarter. 51. FE-1—who was responsible for sourcing component vendors for Talis’s cartridge manufacturing—indicated that it was not possible for Talis to produce million cartridges per month. There was no contingency planning due to the company’s fatal flaw of not building in a scheduling buffer to account for issues that might arise. FE-recalled that CEO Coe was notorious for not having any scheduling buffer, which failed to recognize that in the engineering and operations world, things happen. Plaintiffs allege that the Registration Statement misleadingly stated that concrete steps toward production of the Talis One had been taken and were scheduled in 2021. For example, it stated that Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” to be delivered beginning in “the first quarter of 2021” and stated that “automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month” were “scheduled to begin to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021” and expected to “scale to full capacity through 2021,” a year earlier than the original STI project. Id. ¶ 153. 2. Design Issues Plaintiffs allege that the Talis One suffered from serious design issues and a high invalid rate, meaning that the tests did not yield usable results. The CC alleges that these issues were known ee within the company before the IPO. For example, N 18 53. According to FE-2, it was known well before the Company submitted its first EUA application that the test had a high invalid rate. FE-indicated that this should have been no surprise, as the Talis One was not developed with the biology in mind, and was developed by engineering without much input from the assay department that developed the biological testing. 54. Specifically, FE-described poor communication between the engineering and assay teams, resulting in a lack of pretesting in the Talis One design and design issues such as the size of the cartridges. FE-indicated that the chamber sizes in the Talis One’s cartridges were created without sufficient volume for proper Limits of Detection (the lowest concentration that a test can consistently identify with high probability) because some of the chambers were too small. The CC alleges that notwithstanding these issues, the Registration Statement touted the Talis One as a “highly accurate” product with safety and convenience features, while advising that Talis’s “diagnostic tests may contain errors or defects or be subject to reliability issues,” omitting any mention of the high invalid rates already known to the company. Id. ¶¶ 158-62. 3. Emergency Use Authorization from FDA Talis was required to obtain an EUA from the FDA before marketing or selling the Talis One COVID-test.6 Id. ¶ 59. Obtaining and maintaining an EUA was also required under a contract Talis had received from the National Institutes of Health. Id. ¶ 60.7 Talis submitted its EUA application for “CLIA-moderate” authorization on January 29, 2021, shortly before the February 11, 2021 IPO. Id. ¶ 62; Defs’ Ex. B at 39.8 According to plaintiffs, “[b]y that time, the EUA process was well-established; the FDA had granted EUAs to other COVID- molecular diagnostic tests as early as April 2020, and authorized dozens of such tests by the end of the year.” Id. ¶ 62. “The FDA’s Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers (July 28, 2020) provided specific guidance to companies like Talis seeking EUAs. Applicants were required to submit various studies, some of which measure data about the percentages of specimens that the test correctly identifies as positive or negative relative to a prior test, known as a comparator assay.” Id. ¶¶ 63-64. Because the testing is comparative in nature, the resulting data is only valid if the benchmark comparator assay is reliable. Id. ¶ 65. Due to the importance of the comparator assay, the FDA stated that applicants should use “only” a “high sensitivity” comparator assay. Id. ¶ 67. The CC cites the FDA’s Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers (July 28, 2020), which stated: Under Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA “may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening disease.” This provides medical device manufacturers with an expedited, less costly mechanism for obtaining marketing authorization for their products. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services originally authorized the FDA to grant EUAs related to COVID-on February 4, 2020. CC ¶ 59 n.3. July 31, 2020, Talis issued a press release titled “Talis Awarded NIH RADx Contract to Launch Talis One™ System for Point-of-Care COVID-Testing and Further Strengthens Financial Position and Leadership Team,” announcing that Talis had been awarded a $25 million National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) contract through the NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (“RADx”) initiative (the “RADx Contract”). Id. ¶ 33. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) categorizes tests as waived, moderate complexity, or high complexity. Defs’ Ex. B at 39. The Registration Statement stated that Talis’s “regulatory strategy is to initially submit for the equivalent of CLIA-moderate authorization to be followed shortly thereafter with a subsequent filing for the equivalent of CLIA- waived authorization for use in non-laboratory settings.” Id. at 18. a) “We recommend using only a high sensitivity EUA RT-PCR assay which uses a chemical lysis step followed by solid phase extraction of nucleic acid (e.g., silica bead extraction).” b) “If available, FDA recommends selecting a comparator assay that has established high sensitivity with an internationally recognized standard or the FDA SARSCoV Reference Panel. Please contact CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov to discuss options to establish sensitivity.” Id. Plaintiffs do not allege that the FDA set additional criteria for what did or did not constitute a “high sensitivity” assay. Plaintiffs allege that contrary to the FDA’s guidance, “Talis used a weak comparator assay as a benchmark for its EUA submission.” Id. ¶ 212(i) (citing FE-2).9 However, the Registration Statement extensively touted positive information about the Talis One’s testing and the EUA submission, stating that the Talis One had been tested against an “FDA-authorized”10 comparator assay and that the Talis One displayed “high PPA and NPA [that] is suggestive of clinical sensitivity and specificity.” Id. ¶ 69. The Registration Statement also stated that the “Talis One test results exactly matched the central lab results with 100% positive percentage agreement (PPA) and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPA) for detection of COVID-19,” touted “the very low limits of detection possible on the Talis One platform,” and claimed that the Talis One “demonstrated a limit of detection for SARS-CoV-of ≤500 viral particles per milliliter.” Id. Plaintiffs do not claim that ee Talis misrepresented the test results, but rather that the submission “was deceptive because it N compared the Talis One’s performance to a useless benchmark.” Id. The Registration Statement also disclosed, under “Risk Factors,” that during the FDA’s “preliminary review” of Talis’s EUA submission, the FDA asked Talis to “provide it with additional information” regarding Talis’s test “prior to initiating its substantive review,” and that Talis expected to “promptly provide” that information. Id. ¶ 70. 4. Risk Disclosures Talis’s Offering Documents contained numerous risk disclosures. Defs’ Ex.

Plaintiffs do not allege that the comparator assay was not FDA-authorized. (“Summary of Risk Factors”); id. at 18-(“Risk Factors”). These included: • “There can be no assurance that the COVID-test we are developing for the detection of the SARS-CoV-virus will be granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . . . if we do not receive an EUA for our Talis One platform with COVID-test, the commercial launch of such products could be significantly delayed, which would adversely impact our business[.]” Id. at 18. • “We have no products approved for commercial sale.

B. Withdrawal of Initial EUA Application and Second EUA Application Talis’ IPO was conducted on February 11, 2021. March 8, 2021, Talis issued a press release disclosing that in late February, the FDA had informed the company that it “[could not] ensure the comparator assay used in [Talis’s] primary study has sufficient sensitivity to support Talis’s EUA application.” CC ¶ 75. The press release also announced that Talis had withdrawn its initial EUA application for CLIA-moderate classification and would focus on a new EUA for its previously planned CLIA-waived setting. Id. The press release also stated that “Talis intends to initiate its previously planned clinical validation study in a point-of-care environment, with plans ee to submit an EUA application . . . early in the second quarter of 2021” and “[t]he planned clinical N validation study was designed with a different comparator assay, which Talis believes will address the FDA’s concerns.” Id. Plaintiffs allege that this news drove a 12.3% decline in Talis’s share price, to $12.85 per share. Id. ¶ 76. July 23, 2021, Talis submitted a second EUA application. Defs’ Ex. H at 5. On an investor call held August 10, 2021, Talis reported that the data from its clinical validation study in support of the EUA application “exceed[ed] the FDA’s guidance for 95% concordance with the comparator test results, including both the positive and negative percent agreements.” Defs’ Ex. J at 4. Plaintiffs do not challenge any statements made by Talis regarding this second EUA application. November 8, 2021, Talis announced that the FDA had approved its EUA. CC ¶ 102. C. Post-IPO Plaintiffs’ Exchange Act claims are based on a number of statements that Talis and senior management made to investors between March 30, 2021 and March 15, 2022. Plaintiffs claim that throughout this period, Talis’s senior management continued to mislead the market by touting Talis’s progress towards manufacturing at scale and “terrific” results, when in reality Talis was not ready to begin manufacturing and the Talis One continued to suffer from design issues and a high invalid rate. For example, plaintiffs challenge as false then-CEO Coe’s answer during a May 11, 2021 earnings call to an analyst’s question asking “hypothetically, after [FDA approval of the EUA], how soon can you ship the product out to customers?” CC ¶ 190. Coe responded, “We feel we’ll be in a position to ship product in a very timely manner following an approval. We’re certainly spending quite an effort on commercial preparedness. And as we’ve already commented as well, we have commercial team in place. And we feel very much ready to go on our end.” Id. Plaintiffs allege that Coe’s May 2021 claim that Talis was “ready to go” into production upon receiving an EUA had no basis because Coe “knew there were serious issues with the manufacturing timelines for the Talis One, as FE-[who was working on the design of cartridges for testing] had briefed Coe on the topic over several weeks in May 2021.” CC ¶ 213(ii). In addition, FE-1, who also worked on the cartridge i nt r until his/her departure in March 2021, “recalled a rumor that in or around May 2021, then SVP-of R&D Ramesh Ramakrishnan had provided a new timeline to Coe, who rejected it; Ramakrishnan resigned within days.” CC ¶¶ 90; 211(vi). August 10, 2021, Talis reported its second quarter earnings and senior management held an earnings call with investors. Coe discussed Talis’s recent submission of its second EUA application and stated that “we cannot predict the FDA’s timing for authorization, and we still need to finalize validation of our automation lines,” and “our development timelines have been extended by delays in the launching of our COVID-test and manufacturing scale.” CC ¶ 92; Defs’ Ex. J at 4-5. Coe announced that Talis would be executing a “controlled launch, beginning with target customers to evaluate Talis One followed by a broader market launch,” and COO Liu stated that “[d]uring the second quarter, we modified and improved the first set of automated lines . . . At this time, we have completed installation and are in the final stages of validation. . . . We are making final adjustments and expect to have the cartridges from these lines for commercial launch upon receiving our EUA.” Defs’ Ex. J at 5-6. Liu also announced that while they were “pleased” with the progress on manufacturing, “we have decided to take a phased approach similar to our commercial launch for implementing the second and third sets of automation lines in order to ensure that our first line provides customers with exceptional product quality and to align production with sales [and] [w]e will prepare and deploy additional lines as needed.” Id. at 6. Plaintiffs claim that defendants sought to blunt this negative information with misleading affirmations of progress. In response to an analyst’s question asking “what can you say to give us confidence that the longer-term opportunity is there?”, Coe responded “[Y]es, the timelines are later than we’d anticipated in the IPO model. And on the other hand, our results really look terrific. From a company perspective, we’re way ahead on our ability to produce product relative to almost any company our size historically.” CC ¶ 94. Plaintiffs allege that Talis did not have “terrific” results and was not “way ahead” because the Talis One continued to suffer from a high invalid rate that foreclosed and/or dramatically delayed commercial production. Plaintiffs also allege that the statements about the automated cartridge lines being in the r e 17 “final stages of validation”11 were false and misleading because “in the medical device industry, N 18 ‘validation’ is a technical term that indicates an extensive degree of scrutiny such that a successful result is practically assured.” Id. ¶ 97. Plaintiffs allege that Talis was nowhere near the “final stages of validation” on the automated cartridge manufacturing lines in August 2021 because Talis later admitted (at a March 15, 2022 earnings call, discussed infra) that Talis was “beginning to evaluate the performance of cartridges” in November 2021. Id. ¶ 110. Plaintiffs also cite FE-5, an associate director of technical implementation based in Dallas from September 2021 until March 2022, who “explained that Talis had not validated its production lines, which was significant and one of the major factors in not launching the Talis One” Id. ¶ 215(iii). August 30, 2021, Talis announced that CEO Coe had “stepped down” effective The 2Q21 quarterly report also stated that Talis was in the “final stages of validation for the first set of automated cartridge production lines.” Id. ¶ 96. immediately. Id. ¶ 101. Plaintiffs allege that “Coe’s unplanned departure just six months after the IPO signaled that Talis’s production problems and delays were potentially much more serious than Defendants’ public statements had revealed.” Id. November 15, 2021, one week after announcing that the FDA had approved Talis’s second EUA application, Talis filed a Form 8-K with the SEC and announced that Brian Blaser had been appointed as President, CEO and Director of Talis, effective December 1, 2021. Id. ¶ 103. At an earnings call the same day, Interim CEO Popovits stated that Talis would execute a “controlled product rollout” using a “measured approach.” Id. ¶ 104. Chief Commercial Officer Rob Kelley reiterated that Talis had “decided to take a phased approach for rolling out the Talis One System” with a “limited rollout” to being “in the first quarter of 2022” that would involve “a small number of sites representative of the customers we are targeting . . . .” Id. Plaintiffs allege that this delayed timeline and small-scale commercial introduction was a recognition that Talis was unprepared and unable to manufacture the Talis One at scale. Id. Plaintiffs allege that at this time, the Talis One “was little more than a ‘dummy box’ that sales representatives were instructed not to turn on in meetings at doctors’ offices and hospitals.” Id. ¶ 214(iv). December 1, 2021, Brian Blaser replaced Coe as CEO. Id. ¶ 105. December 8, 2021, ee Talis announced that Blaser had “stepped down” from his positions as President, CEO and Director N effective immediately. Id. Plaintiffs allege, “While Talis publicly claimed that Blaser’s departure was due to ‘personal matters,’ FE-later learned from a contact at another company that Blaser left Talis because there was major fraud.” Id. The Exchange Act class period ends on March 15, 2022, when Talis reported “a barrage of new, negative information” in its first financial reporting under its new CEO Rob Kelley. Id. ¶ 106. On that day, Talis revealed that it “has not started its phased launch of the Talis One COVID-Test System due to challenges with manufacturing” and that the company “has engaged in a manufacturing review process to determine appropriate next steps and undertaken initiatives to align resources and preserve cash.” Id. ¶ 107. Talis’s Form 10-K also stated that Talis had “ordered components for up to 5,000 instruments from our instrument contract manufacturing partners,” which plaintiffs claim is a “materially different truth” from Talis’s previous statements about having ordered “5,000 instruments.” Id. ¶ 111. Talis further disclosed that the company had engaged external consultants “to assess product design for manufacturing at scale, evaluate current processes and partners, and determine appropriate next steps and timing for bringing the Talis One system to market,” that the company was laying off approximately percent of its workforce, and that COO Liu was stepping down. Id. ¶ 112 At a conference call held the same day, CEO Kelley admitted that “the yield and consistency of our current manufacturing process is not yet sufficient to support commercialization” and that “our current process is not yet optimized to produce a minimum monthly yield [of instruments] to support a commercial launch.” Id. ¶ 108. Kelley also stated that “the rate of invalid or failed tests remains higher than what we believe is acceptable”; plaintiffs allege that Kelley misleadingly implied that this was a recent development where, “[i]n reality, the high invalid rates had plagued the device since before the IPO (FE-2) and continued thereafter (FE-4, FE-5).” Id. ¶ 109. Plaintiffs also allege that Kelley conceded that Talis had not been in the “final stages of validation” of Talis’s cartridge production in August 2021 when he said, during the March 15, 2022 conference call, 15 “When we spoke with you back in November, we were beginning to evaluate the performance of cartridges coming off our high-yield lines.” Id. ¶ 110. ee On May 10, 2022, CEO Kelley stated during an earnings call that the company did not expect N the Talis One to make a “significant revenue contribution “ in 2022. Id. ¶ 114. Plaintiffs allege that “after months of false promises with no commercially available product, the market has essentially given up on Talis as a viable company.” Id. ¶ 117. As of June 2022, Talis common stock traded at $0.81 per share. Id. ¶ 118.","I. Factual Background Talis is a biotechnology company that was founded in 2010 to develop point-of-care 16 (“POC”) diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. CC ¶ 27.1 Talis developed the Talis One System, ee 17 a diagnostic platform comprised of (1) single-use test cartridges that prepare and store patient N samples, (2) a box-shaped instrument that analyzes the samples, and (3) software. ; Defs’ Request for Judicial Notice Ex. B at 2-.2 In 2018, Talis was developing rapid POC diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted infections (“STIs”) such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. CC ¶ 28. After the onset of the COVID-pandemic in early 2020, Talis abandoned its original focus on STI testing, and by summer 2020 started to Talis was originally named SlipChip LLC. POC testing “refers to medical diagnostic testing that takes place at or near the time and place of patient care, rather than in a central laboratory.” Id. As discussed infra, the Court grants defendants’ request for consideration of this document as well as several others under the “incorporation by reference” doctrine. develop a molecular test for COVID-19. , 32.3 Talis’s COVID-test was slated to be the source of “[s]ubstantially all” of Talis’s initial revenue. A. IPO/Registration Statement By late 2020, Talis was moving to conduct an IPO. Plaintiffs allege that defendants were motivated to do so because Talis was required to issue a “going concern” warning in October 2020. Talis’s first draft registration statement, which was confidentially filed with the SEC on October 15, 2020, stated “Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” Id.4 Talis also sought to capitalize on a rapidly closing window to sell a new COVID-test before demand cooled due to the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-vaccines in December 2020, and before competing tests captured the market. Talis would need to persuade investors that its product provided fast, accurate, reliable results and could be ee manufactured at scale. , 40-41. N Talis conducted its IPO on February 11, 2021. Shares of Talis common stock were offered at $16 per share, and the IPO raised $253.9 million. Id. Plaintiffs allege that the Registration Statement was false and misleading because (1) Talis was not capable of producing Talis One to scale; (2) the Talis One was non-functional due to design issues; and (3) Talis had botched its crucial application for an EUA from the FDA. The CC explains that there “are two basic types of COVID-diagnostic tests. Antigen tests (like those widely available at drugstores) detect specific viral proteins (antigens), but provide only a simple “yes” or “no” and sacrifice accuracy for speed. By contrast, molecular diagnostic tests amplify genetic material to detect viral nucleic acid (viral RNA), offering greater accuracy but generally lower speed than antigen tests.” Id. Talis temporarily staved off its auditor’s “going concern” warning by raising $126 million in private financing in November 2020. 1. Manufacturing Issues When Talis pivoted from its original focus on STI testing to COVID-testing, it substantially accelerated its timeline for bringing Talis One to market. According to FE- 1,5 a former Talis R&D engineer who worked at Talis from August 2016 to March 2021, “had COVID not happened, the original cartridge for STI testing was slated to go into production in 2022.” Id. Plaintiffs allege that Talis did not have a realistic timeline to manufacture the Talis One and that the process was plagued by production problems: 45. . . . FE-2—a senior scientist with a Ph.D. in molecular genetics—confirmed that Talis did not have a realistic timeline to manufacture its product, let alone bring it to market. Indeed, FE-explained that for much of the period when FE-worked at Talis (February to October 2020), Talis only had one person and a supporting technician working on the COVID-test, but was aggressively applying for grants. FE-described an amalgamation of incompetency at every level within the Company – marketing, alignment with R&D, and even creating a plan or timeline. 46. Similarly, FE-3—an engineer who worked at Talis for over four years before the a IPO—stated that Talis’s timelines were overly aggressive, citing company culture as one of the drivers. When FE-mentioned concerns about the overly aggressive timelines to a scientific advisor on Talis’s Board, the advisor responded that the t l a aggressive timelines were “inspirational.” FE-was infuriated and thought the timelines had no basis. 15 47. In the view of FE-1, a senior mechanical R&D engineer, Talis management t. - t d n r model. FE-further explained that to go from prototype to full production at th volume—a 100-fold increase—was not possible at the time of the IPO. 48. Overall, FE-said that the combination of manufacturing, design, and supply chain issues was like running without your pants pulled up all the way. In the second quarter of 2020, FE-raised flags, especially about an issue with leaking cartridges that only began to be fixed in December of 2020, after being known for a year. Management knew about the leaking cartridges, FE-stated, because Talis had conducted a user study and the feedback was given to all of management. 49. FE-also highlighted Tony Cunningham, the senior director of supply chain starting in July 2020. Starting around August 2020, FE-spoke directly about supply issues to Cunningham, who reported to CFO Roger Moody, but Cunningham ignored and downplayed FE-1’s concerns. FE-also explained that Talis’s executive team knew what was being purchased and they knew the testing results. 50. Talis was also significantly behind its internal deadlines shortly before the February 2021 IPO. FE-explained that Cunningham posted a weekly schedule of production that indicated a Q4 2020 goal of producing 1,000 instruments for beta The CC relies on five confidential witnesses who are former employees (“FE”) of Talis. testing and to prove Talis’s manufacturing capability, but Talis produced far fewer instruments in the quarter. 51. FE-1—who was responsible for sourcing component vendors for Talis’s cartridge manufacturing—indicated that it was not possible for Talis to produce million cartridges per month. There was no contingency planning due to the company’s fatal flaw of not building in a scheduling buffer to account for issues that might arise. FE-recalled that CEO Coe was notorious for not having any scheduling buffer, which failed to recognize that in the engineering and operations world, things happen. Plaintiffs allege that the Registration Statement misleadingly stated that concrete steps toward production of the Talis One had been taken and were scheduled in 2021. For example, it stated that Talis had “ordered 5,000 instruments” to be delivered beginning in “the first quarter of 2021” and stated that “automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month” were “scheduled to begin to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021” and expected to “scale to full capacity through 2021,” a year earlier than the original STI project. 2. Design Issues Plaintiffs allege that the Talis One suffered from serious design issues and a high invalid rate, meaning that the tests did not yield usable results. The CC alleges that these issues were known ee within the company before the IPO. For example, N 18 53. According to FE-2, it was known well before the Company submitted its first EUA application that the test had a high invalid rate. FE-indicated that this should have been no surprise, as the Talis One was not developed with the biology in mind, and was developed by engineering without much input from the assay department that developed the biological testing. 54. Specifically, FE-described poor communication between the engineering and assay teams, resulting in a lack of pretesting in the Talis One design and design issues such as the size of the cartridges. FE-indicated that the chamber sizes in the Talis One’s cartridges were created without sufficient volume for proper Limits of Detection (the lowest concentration that a test can consistently identify with high probability) because some of the chambers were too small. The CC alleges that notwithstanding these issues, the Registration Statement touted the Talis One as a “highly accurate” product with safety and convenience features, while advising that Talis’s “diagnostic tests may contain errors or defects or be subject to reliability issues,” omitting any mention of the high invalid rates already known to the company. 3. Emergency Use Authorization from FDA Talis was required to obtain an EUA from the FDA before marketing or selling the Talis One COVID-test.6 Obtaining and maintaining an EUA was also required under a contract Talis had received from the National Institutes of Health. 7 Talis submitted its EUA application for “CLIA-moderate” authorization on January 29, 2021, shortly before the February 11, 2021 IPO. ; Defs’ Ex. B at 39.8 According to plaintiffs, “[b]y that time, the EUA process was well-established; the FDA had granted EUAs to other COVID- molecular diagnostic tests as early as April 2020, and authorized dozens of such tests by the end of the year.” “The FDA’s Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers (July 28, 2020) provided specific guidance to companies like Talis seeking EUAs. Applicants were required to submit various studies, some of which measure data about the percentages of specimens that the test correctly identifies as positive or negative relative to a prior test, known as a comparator assay.” Because the testing is comparative in nature, the resulting data is only valid if the benchmark comparator assay is reliable. Due to the importance of the comparator assay, the FDA stated that applicants should use “only” a “high sensitivity” comparator assay. The CC cites the FDA’s Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers (July 28, 2020), which stated: Under Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA “may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening disease.” This provides medical device manufacturers with an expedited, less costly mechanism for obtaining marketing authorization for their products. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services originally authorized the FDA to grant EUAs related to COVID-on February 4, 2020. CC ¶ 59 n.3. July 31, 2020, Talis issued a press release titled “Talis Awarded NIH RADx Contract to Launch Talis One™ System for Point-of-Care COVID-Testing and Further Strengthens Financial Position and Leadership Team,” announcing that Talis had been awarded a $25 million National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) contract through the NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (“RADx”) initiative (the “RADx Contract”). The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) categorizes tests as waived, moderate complexity, or high complexity. Defs’ Ex. B at 39. The Registration Statement stated that Talis’s “regulatory strategy is to initially submit for the equivalent of CLIA-moderate authorization to be followed shortly thereafter with a subsequent filing for the equivalent of CLIA- waived authorization for use in non-laboratory settings.” Id. at 18. a) “We recommend using only a high sensitivity EUA RT-PCR assay which uses a chemical lysis step followed by solid phase extraction of nucleic acid (e.g., silica bead extraction).” b) “If available, FDA recommends selecting a comparator assay that has established high sensitivity with an internationally recognized standard or the FDA SARSCoV Reference Panel. Please contact CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov to discuss options to establish sensitivity.” Id. Plaintiffs do not allege that the FDA set additional criteria for what did or did not constitute a “high sensitivity” assay. Plaintiffs allege that contrary to the FDA’s guidance, “Talis used a weak comparator assay as a benchmark for its EUA submission.” (i) (citing FE-2).9 However, the Registration Statement extensively touted positive information about the Talis One’s testing and the EUA submission, stating that the Talis One had been tested against an “FDA-authorized”10 comparator assay and that the Talis One displayed “high PPA and NPA [that] is suggestive of clinical sensitivity and specificity.” The Registration Statement also stated that the “Talis One test results exactly matched the central lab results with 100% positive percentage agreement (PPA) and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPA) for detection of COVID-19,” touted “the very low limits of detection possible on the Talis One platform,” and claimed that the Talis One “demonstrated a limit of detection for SARS-CoV-of ≤500 viral particles per milliliter.” Id. Plaintiffs do not claim that ee Talis misrepresented the test results, but rather that the submission “was deceptive because it N compared the Talis One’s performance to a useless benchmark.” Id. The Registration Statement also disclosed, under “Risk Factors,” that during the FDA’s “preliminary review” of Talis’s EUA submission, the FDA asked Talis to “provide it with additional information” regarding Talis’s test “prior to initiating its substantive review,” and that Talis expected to “promptly provide” that information. 4.

B. Withdrawal of Initial EUA Application and Second EUA Application Talis’ IPO was conducted on February 11, 2021. March 8, 2021, Talis issued a press release disclosing that in late February, the FDA had informed the company that it “[could not] ensure the comparator assay used in [Talis’s] primary study has sufficient sensitivity to support Talis’s EUA application.” CC ¶ 75.

Post-IPO Plaintiffs’ Exchange Act claims are based on a number of statements that Talis and senior management made to investors between March 30, 2021 and March 15, 2022. Plaintiffs claim that throughout this period, Talis’s senior management continued to mislead the market by touting Talis’s progress towards manufacturing at scale and “terrific” results, when in reality Talis was not ready to begin manufacturing and the Talis One continued to suffer from design issues and a high invalid rate.

We are making final adjustments and expect to have the cartridges from these lines for commercial launch upon receiving our EUA.” Defs’ Ex. J at 5-6. Liu also announced that while they were “pleased” with the progress on manufacturing, “we have decided to take a phased approach similar to our commercial launch for implementing the second and third sets of automation lines in order to ensure that our first line provides customers with exceptional product quality and to align production with sales [and] [w]e will prepare and deploy additional lines as needed.” Id. at 6. Plaintiffs claim that defendants sought to blunt this negative information with misleading affirmations of progress. In response to an analyst’s question asking “what can you say to give us confidence that the longer-term opportunity is there?”, Coe responded “[Y]es, the timelines are later than we’d anticipated in the IPO model. And on the other hand, our results really look terrific. From a company perspective, we’re way ahead on our ability to produce product relative to almost any company our size historically.” CC ¶ 94. Plaintiffs allege that Talis did not have “terrific” results and was not “way ahead” because the Talis One continued to suffer from a high invalid rate that foreclosed and/or dramatically delayed commercial production. Plaintiffs also allege that the statements about the automated cartridge lines being in the r e 17 “final stages of validation”11 were false and misleading because “in the medical device industry, N 18 ‘validation’ is a technical term that indicates an extensive degree of scrutiny such that a successful result is practically assured.” Plaintiffs allege that Talis was nowhere near the “final stages of validation” on the automated cartridge manufacturing lines in August 2021 because Talis later admitted (at a March 15, 2022 earnings call, discussed infra) that Talis was “beginning to evaluate the performance of cartridges” in November 2021. Plaintiffs also cite FE-5, an associate director of technical implementation based in Dallas from September 2021 until March 2022, who “explained that Talis had not validated its production lines, which was significant and one of the major factors in not launching the Talis One” (iii). August 30, 2021, Talis announced that CEO Coe had “stepped down” effective The 2Q21 quarterly report also stated that Talis was in the “final stages of validation for the first set of automated cartridge production lines.” immediately. Plaintiffs allege that “Coe’s unplanned departure just six months after the IPO signaled that Talis’s production problems and delays were potentially much more serious than Defendants’ public statements had revealed.” Id. November 15, 2021, one week after announcing that the FDA had approved Talis’s second EUA application, Talis filed a Form 8-K with the SEC and announced that Brian Blaser had been appointed as President, CEO and Director of Talis, effective December 1, 2021. At an earnings call the same day, Interim CEO Popovits stated that Talis would execute a “controlled product rollout” using a “measured approach.” Chief Commercial Officer Rob Kelley reiterated that Talis had “decided to take a phased approach for rolling out the Talis One System” with a “limited rollout” to being “in the first quarter of 2022” that would involve “a small number of sites representative of the customers we are targeting . . . .” Id. Plaintiffs allege that this delayed timeline and small-scale commercial introduction was a recognition that Talis was unprepared and unable to manufacture the Talis One at scale. Id. Plaintiffs allege that at this time, the Talis One “was little more than a ‘dummy box’ that sales representatives were instructed not to turn on in meetings at doctors’ offices and hospitals.” (iv). December 1, 2021, Brian Blaser replaced Coe as CEO. December 8, 2021, ee Talis announced that Blaser had “stepped down” from his positions as President, CEO and Director N effective immediately. Id. Plaintiffs allege, “While Talis publicly claimed that Blaser’s departure was due to ‘personal matters,’ FE-later learned from a contact at another company that Blaser left Talis because there was major fraud.” Id. The Exchange Act class period ends on March 15, 2022, when Talis reported “a barrage of new, negative information” in its first financial reporting under its new CEO Rob Kelley. On that day, Talis revealed that it “has not started its phased launch of the Talis One COVID-Test System due to challenges with manufacturing” and that the company “has engaged in a manufacturing review process to determine appropriate next steps and undertaken initiatives to align resources and preserve cash.” Talis’s Form 10-K also stated that Talis had “ordered components for up to 5,000 instruments from our instrument contract manufacturing partners,” which plaintiffs claim is a “materially different truth” from Talis’s previous statements about having ordered “5,000 instruments.” Talis further disclosed that the company had engaged external consultants “to assess product design for manufacturing at scale, evaluate current processes and partners, and determine appropriate next steps and timing for bringing the Talis One system to market,” that the company was laying off approximately percent of its workforce, and that COO Liu was stepping down. At a conference call held the same day, CEO Kelley admitted that “the yield and consistency of our current manufacturing process is not yet sufficient to support commercialization” and that “our current process is not yet optimized to produce a minimum monthly yield [of instruments] to support a commercial launch.” Kelley also stated that “the rate of invalid or failed tests remains higher than what we believe is acceptable”; plaintiffs allege that Kelley misleadingly implied that this was a recent development where, “[i]n reality, the high invalid rates had plagued the device since before the IPO (FE-2) and continued thereafter (FE-4, FE-5).” Plaintiffs also allege that Kelley conceded that Talis had not been in the “final stages of validation” of Talis’s cartridge production in August 2021 when he said, during the March 15, 2022 conference call, 15 “When we spoke with you back in November, we were beginning to evaluate the performance of cartridges coming off our high-yield lines.” ee On May 10, 2022, CEO Kelley stated during an earnings call that the company did not expect N the Talis One to make a “significant revenue contribution “ in 2022. Plaintiffs allege that “after months of false promises with no commercially available product, the market has essentially given up on Talis as a viable company.” As of June 2022, Talis common stock traded at $0.81 per share."

cand-4_22-cv-02672.pdf,cand,42429,16943,16460,"ee Lead Plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, as a trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, brings this action N individually and on behalf of all other persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Netflix common stock between January 19, 2021 and April 19, 2022, inclusive (“Class Period”). ECF No. 30 ¶¶ 1, 25 . Pirani alleges that Netflix and certain of its officers—Hastings (co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer), Sarandos (co-Chief Executive Officer), Neumann (Chief Financial Officer), and Peters (Chief Operating Officer) (collectively “Individual Defendants”)— violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 10b-by making false and misleading statements and omissions about Netflix’s business, operations, and prospects that artificially inflated the price of Netflix stock during the Class Period. Id. ¶¶ 213–223. For purposes of resolving the present motion, the Court accepts as true the factual allegations in the CAC, ECF No. 30. Netflix is an entertainment company that primarily operates a subscription-based streaming service offering a wide array of television, film, and mobile games in over 190 countries. Id. ¶ 36. Netflix derives its revenue principally from its streaming service’s monthly membership fees. Id. ¶ 38. Unlike some of its competitors, Netflix does not derive its subscription-based streaming service’s revenue from advertisers. Id. ¶ 47. Thus, its revenue depends on its ability to acquire and retain subscribers. Id. During the Class Period, Netflix would issue quarterly guidance regarding the expected “paid net membership additions or ‘paid net adds.’” Id. ¶ 39. The paid net adds were calculated by subtracting the memberships that were cancelled during a quarter from the number of paid new memberships added during a quarter, “or more simply acquisition minus churn.” Id. Netflix also reported information regarding user engagement with its service. Until the end of 2021, Netflix measured user engagement “by the number of accounts that viewed a title.” Id. In 2022, Netflix measured engagement by “the number of hours viewed per title.” Id. Netflix “considered acquisition, churn, and engagement important metrics to gauge the health of the business.” Id. 15 ¶ 40. During and before the Class Period, Netflix’s guidance and reports categorized its ee members into four geographic regions: (1) the United States and Canada (“UCAN”); (2) Europe, N the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); (3) Latin America (“LATAM”); and (4) Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). Id. ¶ 41. Additionally, during the Class Period, Netflix estimated that its total addressable market (“TAM”) outside of China was approximately 800 million to 900 million broadband households, and “the TAM in the UCAN was estimated to be approximately 125 million broadband households.” Id. Pirani’s allegations center around account sharing, which occurs when a paying Netflix member shares their account credentials (username and password) with a non-paying user who does not reside in the subscriber’s household so that the non-paying user can access and use Netflix’s platform. Netflix’s members engaged in account sharing before and during the Class Period. Id. ¶ 48. Between 2013 and 2018, Hastings, Peters, and other Netflix officers dismissed analysts’ concerns regarding account sharing and its impact on Netflix’s revenue and potential growth. See, e.g., id. ¶ 49 (Hastings stating in 2013 that Netflix “really [did not] think that there[] [was] much going on of the ‘I’m going to share my password with a marginal acquaintance’”); id. ¶ 50 (then-CEO David Wells stating in 2013 that account “sharing is not quite as large as has been 4 . . . floated out there”); id. ¶ 55 (Wells stating in 2016 that Netflix did not “feel like [account sharing was] a material inhibitor to [its] growth” (emphasis omitted)); id. ¶ 59 (Peters stating in 2017 that “password sharing isn’t a huge issue for us right now” (emphasis omitted)). January 2019, Cybersecurity Insiders reported that “Netflix has decided to use Synamedia’s Credential Sharing behavioral analytics and machine learning software to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services.” Id. ¶ 62. Synamedia’s product was believed to be capable of differentiating between “legitimate” account sharing (sharing within a household) and “illegitimate” account sharing (sharing with people outside of the member’s household). Id. ¶ 63. Cybersecurity Insiders’ article also stated that this product was “capable of viewing habits and location habits of a user to identify when non-paying viewers log into an account”; “detect[ing] whether a user is ‘viewing at their main home’ or a ‘holiday home’”; and “detect[ing] if a subscriber has ‘grown-up children who live away from home’ so streaming services won’t punish the wrong people for account sharing.” Id. Netflix never publicly confirmed that it was ee using this product, but in October 2019, Peters did state that Netflix “continue[s] to monitor” N account sharing, but it has “no big plans to announce at this point in time in terms of doing something differently there.” Id. ¶ 64 (emphasis omitted). Additionally, a former employee (“FE2”), who worked at Netflix as a narrative and product designer from 2019 until 2022, stated that “Netflix was tracking the various IP addresses used to determine the location of different users on the same account,” which allowed Netflix “to determine password sharing was happening.” Id. ¶ 191. In 2019 and 2020, analysts and market observers estimated how pervasive account sharing was, as well as its impact on streaming services’ revenue. Id. ¶ 61 (January 2019 Yahoo! Finance article stating that “[f]reeloading off other people deprives Netflix (NFLX) of at least $2.3 billion in revenue each year”); id. ¶ 65 (July 2019 MoffetNathanson research indicating that “about 14% of Netflix users report they are using a password from ‘someone outside of my household’”); id. (June 2020 Wall Street Journal article reporting that “[o]ne-third of subscribers to services like Netflix share their password with someone outside their household, according to a February survey of 2,235 subscribers by Magid, a market-research company”). Netflix purported to have “created guardrails to prevent abuse,” but the only apparent “guardrail” it had implemented was curbing the number of simultaneous streams allowed per member. Id. ¶ 66. A former employee (“FE1”), who served as the Director of Program Management from January 2018 to March 2021, stated the problem of account sharing was discussed during his tenure at the Company. Id. ¶¶ 32, 67. However, any efforts to “crack[]down” on the problem were paused during early 2020 because of the COVID-pandemic. Id. ¶ 67. FE1 recalled that this approach was outlined in a Company-wide internal memorandum, id., and that Hastings stated that Netflix “did not want to appear as if they were taking something away” during the pandemic “when people were losing so much at that time (e.g., health, jobs, housing),” id. ¶ 68 (emphasis omitted). Netflix’s 2020 Form 13 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021 described “account sharing” as “multi-household usage” and added language discussing “efforts to restrict multi-household usage,” specifically adding the phrase to its risk disclosure regarding account sharing: “if our efforts to restrict multi- household usage are ineffective.” Id. ¶ 82 (emphasis omitted) . But Netflix “did not disclose any ee new measures that it was taking to restrict account sharing or discuss the impact account sharing N was having on its acquisition efforts.” Id. ¶ 83. FE2 also attended “company-wide quarterly business review meetings where presentations about password sharing were shown” that were hosted by Hastings. Id. ¶ 189. FE2 also attended “design team meetings where password sharing was discussed, which were held either monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly.” Id. At these meetings account “sharing was characterized as ‘lost revenue’ and was seen as limiting the Company’s ability to meet its subscriber goals.” Id. ¶ 190. FE2 stated that “these discussions made it clear that the Company had significant data about password sharing and were analyzing the data and quantifying it.” Id. And “the size of the problem was noted in order to justify embarking on efforts to limit or ‘crack down’ on account sharing.” Id. Additionally, in March 2021, the Washington Post reported that some Netflix members received a message that stated “[i]f you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.” Id. ¶ 84. The article included the following statement from a Netflix spokesperson, “[t]his test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so,” but it also noted that Netflix “did not answer questions about the size of the test or if the company would adopt it more widely[.]” Id. The Bank of America, Benchmark Company, and J.P. Morgan issued reports that discussed Netflix’s “crackdown” on account sharing. Id. ¶¶ 85–87. Netflix experienced higher-than-expected membership growth during the first half of 2020, which the Company termed the “COVID pull-forward” because government stay-at-home orders issued in the early days of the pandemic “caused a substantial number of new subscribers to sign up for Netflix earlier than the Company had projected.” Id. ¶ 70. Netflix correctly predicted that this growth would slow in the second half of 2020 “as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions.” Id. ¶¶ 71, 73. During the October 20, 2020 earnings call, Hastings stated that “the pull-forward into next year [would be] relatively modest,” and explained that there would “probably [be] a little bit of the effect in Q1 from the pull-forward, maybe a little bit less in 16 Q2, but it will wash out.” Id. ¶ 74 (emphasis omitted). ee At the beginning of the Class Period, Netflix forecasted paid net adds of six million in Q1 N 18 2021, which was lower than paid net adds for Q1 2020 because Q1 2020 “included the impact from the initial COVID-lockdowns.” Id. ¶ 75. In the event, Netflix missed this guidance by two million. Id. ¶ 89. Netflix did exceed its guidance for Q2 2021 and Q3 2021, but that guidance was well below what was expected by analysts and market observers. Id. ¶¶ 94, 98. Defendants assured analysts and shareholders that business metrics remained healthy; that the Company had ample room for growth in all its geographical regions, including those regions with higher penetration like UCAN and LATAM; and attributed any slow growth to the COVID pull-forward. Id. ¶¶ 95–96, 99–102. During the October 19, 2021 earnings call, Neumann stated that the paid net adds results indicated that Netflix had reached the “tail end of the COVID choppiness, the pull-forward of sub growth into 2020 and those production delays that [Netflix was] working through as well.” Id. ¶ 99. January 20, 2022, Netflix announced that it had missed its guidance for Q4 2021 and issued weak guidance for Q1 2022, which was lower than that of Q1 2021, because its “acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels.” Id. ¶ 105 (emphasis omitted). During the earnings call that same day, an analyst asked Defendants whether the low guidance for the next quarter “raise[d] any concerns for [Netflix] about anything structural, whether it’s competition or saturation?” Id. ¶ 109 (emphasis omitted). Neumann responded there was “[n]o structural change in the business that [they saw],” and that Netflix was “trying to pinpoint what” the problem is, but it was “tough to say exactly why [its] acquisition hasn’t kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Hastings added that “COVID has introduced so much noise,” but Netflix’s “execution is steady and getting better.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Additionally, in response to an analyst’s concerns regarding Netflix’s “flattish” paid net adds in the fourth quarter of 2021, Sarandos stated that COVID “created a lot of bumpiness . . . , which makes it a little tougher to predict, but all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.” Id. ¶ 110 (emphasis omitted). Finally, in response an analyst’s question about whether LATAM’s 15 “maturing at a lower level of penetration than . . . the U.S.” was “due to competition, affordability 16 . . . [a]ccount sharing [o]r something else,” Neumann replied that he “wouldn’t necessarily read ee through that it’s maturing faster,” the “business [was] still growing there,” and “there’s a long N runway of growth there.” Id. ¶ 111 (emphasis omitted). After this news, the Company’s stock price fell “21.7%, to close at $397.50 per share on January 21, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume.” Id. ¶ 176. During a Morgan Stanley Conference on March 8, 2022, Neumann stated that the UCAN market was roughly 60% penetrated, and Netflix was “not done growing in the U.S.” Id. ¶ 112. Shortly after, on March 16, 2022, Netflix announced that paid account sharing features would be tested in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru “before making changes anywhere else in the world.” Id. ¶ 113. Specifically, Netflix stated that its plans allowing multiple simultaneous streams “‘created some confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared,’ and ‘[a]s a result, accounts are being shared between households – impacting [its] ability to invest in great new TV and films for [its] members.’” Id. Netflix also stated that it had been “working on ways to enable members who share outside their household to do so easily and securely, while also paying a bit more.” Id. (emphasis omitted). However, Defendants knowingly withheld adverse facts during the Class Period. Specifically, during the Class Period, between approximately 91.7 million and 100 million households globally were using Netflix’s platform through account sharing, including between approximately 29.7 million and 30.3 million in UCAN. Id. ¶¶ 132a, 134a, 136a, 138a, 140a, 143a, 145a, 147a, 149a, 151a, 153a, 155a, 157a, 159a, 161a, 163a, 165a, 167a, 169a, 171a, 173a.

N April 19, 2022, Netflix reported its financial results for the Q1 2022, and announced that it did not meet its paid net add guidance and that for Q2 2022 it expected that paid net adds would be “-2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter.” Id. ¶¶ 115 (emphasis omitted).

Netflix claimed that the issue of account sharing “was obscured by [its] COVID growth.” Id. ¶ 117(emphasis omitted).

In response to this news, analysts and investors expressed surprise at the extent of the issue of account sharing. Id. ¶ 125. And Netflix’s stock price fell “over 35%, to close at $226.19 per share on April 20, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume.” Id. ¶ 126. Multiple shareholders filed class action complaints, which were consolidated into a single action. ECF No. 37. Pirani filed the operative CAC on December 12, 2022. ECF No. 30. Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss on February 10, 2023. ECF No. 31. Pirani filed an opposition, ECF No. 39, and Defendants filed a reply, ECF No. 41.","ee Lead Plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, as a trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, brings this action N individually and on behalf of all other persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Netflix common stock between January 19, 2021 and April 19, 2022, inclusive (“Class Period”). ECF No. 30 ¶¶ 1, 25 . Pirani alleges that Netflix and certain of its officers—Hastings (co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer), Sarandos (co-Chief Executive Officer), Neumann (Chief Financial Officer), and Peters (Chief Operating Officer) (collectively “Individual Defendants”)— violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 10b-by making false and misleading statements and omissions about Netflix’s business, operations, and prospects that artificially inflated the price of Netflix stock during the Class Period. For purposes of resolving the present motion, the Court accepts as true the factual allegations in the CAC, ECF No. 30. Netflix is an entertainment company that primarily operates a subscription-based streaming service offering a wide array of television, film, and mobile games in over 190 countries. Netflix derives its revenue principally from its streaming service’s monthly membership fees. Unlike some of its competitors, Netflix does not derive its subscription-based streaming service’s revenue from advertisers. Thus, its revenue depends on its ability to acquire and retain subscribers. Id. During the Class Period, Netflix would issue quarterly guidance regarding the expected “paid net membership additions or ‘paid net adds.’” The paid net adds were calculated by subtracting the memberships that were cancelled during a quarter from the number of paid new memberships added during a quarter, “or more simply acquisition minus churn.” Id. Netflix also reported information regarding user engagement with its service. Until the end of 2021, Netflix measured user engagement “by the number of accounts that viewed a title.” Id. In 2022, Netflix measured engagement by “the number of hours viewed per title.” Id. Netflix “considered acquisition, churn, and engagement important metrics to gauge the health of the business.” Id. 15 ¶ 40. During and before the Class Period, Netflix’s guidance and reports categorized its ee members into four geographic regions: (1) the United States and Canada (“UCAN”); (2) Europe, N the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); (3) Latin America (“LATAM”); and (4) Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). Additionally, during the Class Period, Netflix estimated that its total addressable market (“TAM”) outside of China was approximately 800 million to 900 million broadband households, and “the TAM in the UCAN was estimated to be approximately 125 million broadband households.” Id. Pirani’s allegations center around account sharing, which occurs when a paying Netflix member shares their account credentials (username and password) with a non-paying user who does not reside in the subscriber’s household so that the non-paying user can access and use Netflix’s platform. Netflix’s members engaged in account sharing before and during the Class Period. Between 2013 and 2018, Hastings, Peters, and other Netflix officers dismissed analysts’ concerns regarding account sharing and its impact on Netflix’s revenue and potential growth. See, e.g., id. ¶ 49 (Hastings stating in 2013 that Netflix “really [did not] think that there[] [was] much going on of the ‘I’m going to share my password with a marginal acquaintance’”); id. ¶ 50 (then-CEO David Wells stating in 2013 that account “sharing is not quite as large as has been 4 . . . floated out there”); id. ¶ 55 (Wells stating in 2016 that Netflix did not “feel like [account sharing was] a material inhibitor to [its] growth” (emphasis omitted)); id. ¶ 59 (Peters stating in 2017 that “password sharing isn’t a huge issue for us right now” (emphasis omitted)). January 2019, Cybersecurity Insiders reported that “Netflix has decided to use Synamedia’s Credential Sharing behavioral analytics and machine learning software to keep a tab on the sharing activity across its streaming services.” Synamedia’s product was believed to be capable of differentiating between “legitimate” account sharing (sharing within a household) and “illegitimate” account sharing (sharing with people outside of the member’s household). Cybersecurity Insiders’ article also stated that this product was “capable of viewing habits and location habits of a user to identify when non-paying viewers log into an account”; “detect[ing] whether a user is ‘viewing at their main home’ or a ‘holiday home’”; and “detect[ing] if a subscriber has ‘grown-up children who live away from home’ so streaming services won’t punish the wrong people for account sharing.” Id. Netflix never publicly confirmed that it was ee using this product, but in October 2019, Peters did state that Netflix “continue[s] to monitor” N account sharing, but it has “no big plans to announce at this point in time in terms of doing something differently there.” (emphasis omitted). Additionally, a former employee (“FE2”), who worked at Netflix as a narrative and product designer from 2019 until 2022, stated that “Netflix was tracking the various IP addresses used to determine the location of different users on the same account,” which allowed Netflix “to determine password sharing was happening.” In 2019 and 2020, analysts and market observers estimated how pervasive account sharing was, as well as its impact on streaming services’ revenue. (January 2019 Yahoo! Finance article stating that “[f]reeloading off other people deprives Netflix (NFLX) of at least $2.3 billion in revenue each year”); id. ¶ 65 (July 2019 MoffetNathanson research indicating that “about 14% of Netflix users report they are using a password from ‘someone outside of my household’”); id. (June 2020 Wall Street Journal article reporting that “[o]ne-third of subscribers to services like Netflix share their password with someone outside their household, according to a February survey of 2,235 subscribers by Magid, a market-research company”). Netflix purported to have “created guardrails to prevent abuse,” but the only apparent “guardrail” it had implemented was curbing the number of simultaneous streams allowed per member. A former employee (“FE1”), who served as the Director of Program Management from January 2018 to March 2021, stated the problem of account sharing was discussed during his tenure at the Company. , 67. However, any efforts to “crack[]down” on the problem were paused during early 2020 because of the COVID-pandemic. FE1 recalled that this approach was outlined in a Company-wide internal memorandum, id., and that Hastings stated that Netflix “did not want to appear as if they were taking something away” during the pandemic “when people were losing so much at that time (e.g., health, jobs, housing),” id. ¶ 68 (emphasis omitted). Netflix’s 2020 Form 13 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021 described “account sharing” as “multi-household usage” and added language discussing “efforts to restrict multi-household usage,” specifically adding the phrase to its risk disclosure regarding account sharing: “if our efforts to restrict multi- household usage are ineffective.” (emphasis omitted) . But Netflix “did not disclose any ee new measures that it was taking to restrict account sharing or discuss the impact account sharing N was having on its acquisition efforts.” FE2 also attended “company-wide quarterly business review meetings where presentations about password sharing were shown” that were hosted by Hastings. FE2 also attended “design team meetings where password sharing was discussed, which were held either monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly.” Id. At these meetings account “sharing was characterized as ‘lost revenue’ and was seen as limiting the Company’s ability to meet its subscriber goals.” FE2 stated that “these discussions made it clear that the Company had significant data about password sharing and were analyzing the data and quantifying it.” Id. And “the size of the problem was noted in order to justify embarking on efforts to limit or ‘crack down’ on account sharing.” Id. Additionally, in March 2021, the Washington Post reported that some Netflix members received a message that stated “[i]f you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.” The article included the following statement from a Netflix spokesperson, “[t]his test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so,” but it also noted that Netflix “did not answer questions about the size of the test or if the company would adopt it more widely[.]” Id. The Bank of America, Benchmark Company, and J.P. Morgan issued reports that discussed Netflix’s “crackdown” on account sharing. Netflix experienced higher-than-expected membership growth during the first half of 2020, which the Company termed the “COVID pull-forward” because government stay-at-home orders issued in the early days of the pandemic “caused a substantial number of new subscribers to sign up for Netflix earlier than the Company had projected.” Netflix correctly predicted that this growth would slow in the second half of 2020 “as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions.” , 73. During the October 20, 2020 earnings call, Hastings stated that “the pull-forward into next year [would be] relatively modest,” and explained that there would “probably [be] a little bit of the effect in Q1 from the pull-forward, maybe a little bit less in 16 Q2, but it will wash out.” (emphasis omitted). ee At the beginning of the Class Period, Netflix forecasted paid net adds of six million in Q1 N 18 2021, which was lower than paid net adds for Q1 2020 because Q1 2020 “included the impact from the initial COVID-lockdowns.” In the event, Netflix missed this guidance by two million. Netflix did exceed its guidance for Q2 2021 and Q3 2021, but that guidance was well below what was expected by analysts and market observers. , 98. Defendants assured analysts and shareholders that business metrics remained healthy; that the Company had ample room for growth in all its geographical regions, including those regions with higher penetration like UCAN and LATAM; and attributed any slow growth to the COVID pull-forward. , 99–102. During the October 19, 2021 earnings call, Neumann stated that the paid net adds results indicated that Netflix had reached the “tail end of the COVID choppiness, the pull-forward of sub growth into 2020 and those production delays that [Netflix was] working through as well.” January 20, 2022, Netflix announced that it had missed its guidance for Q4 2021 and issued weak guidance for Q1 2022, which was lower than that of Q1 2021, because its “acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels.” (emphasis omitted). During the earnings call that same day, an analyst asked Defendants whether the low guidance for the next quarter “raise[d] any concerns for [Netflix] about anything structural, whether it’s competition or saturation?” (emphasis omitted). Neumann responded there was “[n]o structural change in the business that [they saw],” and that Netflix was “trying to pinpoint what” the problem is, but it was “tough to say exactly why [its] acquisition hasn’t kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Hastings added that “COVID has introduced so much noise,” but Netflix’s “execution is steady and getting better.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Additionally, in response to an analyst’s concerns regarding Netflix’s “flattish” paid net adds in the fourth quarter of 2021, Sarandos stated that COVID “created a lot of bumpiness . . . , which makes it a little tougher to predict, but all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.” (emphasis omitted). Finally, in response an analyst’s question about whether LATAM’s 15 “maturing at a lower level of penetration than . . . the U.S.” was “due to competition, affordability 16 . . . [a]ccount sharing [o]r something else,” Neumann replied that he “wouldn’t necessarily read ee through that it’s maturing faster,” the “business [was] still growing there,” and “there’s a long N runway of growth there.” (emphasis omitted). After this news, the Company’s stock price fell “21.7%, to close at $397.50 per share on January 21, 2022, on unusually heavy trading volume.” During a Morgan Stanley Conference on March 8, 2022, Neumann stated that the UCAN market was roughly 60% penetrated, and Netflix was “not done growing in the U.S.” Shortly after, on March 16, 2022, Netflix announced that paid account sharing features would be tested in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru “before making changes anywhere else in the world.” Specifically, Netflix stated that its plans allowing multiple simultaneous streams “‘created some confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared,’ and ‘[a]s a result, accounts are being shared between households – impacting [its] ability to invest in great new TV and films for [its] members.’” Id. Netflix also stated that it had been “working on ways to enable members who share outside their household to do so easily and securely, while also paying a bit more.” Id. (emphasis omitted). However, Defendants knowingly withheld adverse facts during the Class Period. Specifically, during the Class Period, between approximately 91.7 million and 100 million households globally were using Netflix’s platform through account sharing, including between approximately 29.7 million and 30.3 million in UCAN. a, 134a, 136a, 138a, 140a, 143a, 145a, 147a, 149a, 151a, 153a, 155a, 157a, 159a, 161a, 163a, 165a, 167a, 169a, 171a, 173a.

Overview of Facts Alleged in the Amended Complaint For the purpose of resolving the present motion, the Court accepts as true the factual ee allegations in the AC, ECF No. 53. N Lead Plaintiff Olger Guri and named plaintiff Ken Kula (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) bring this securities fraud proposed class action against Defendants Fastly, Inc. (“Fastly” or “the Company”), Todd Nightingale (Fastly’s Chief Executive Officer), and Ronald Kisling (Fastly’s Chief Financial Officer), alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a proposed class of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Fastly securities between November 15, 2023, and August 7, 2024 (“Class Period”). Fastly operates an edge cloud platform for processing, serving, and securing customers’ applications. Id. ¶ 2. Fastly’s customers pay the Company to deliver web experiences, whether in the form of applications, websites, or streaming services. Id. Fastly charges customers based on their usage of the Company’s platform and typically enters into contracts that include a monthly minimum billing commitment in exchange for more favorable pricing terms. Id. ¶ 4. The bulk of Fastly’s revenue is derived from its existing customers’ “traffic” or usage of its platform, although the Company generates some revenue from additional products and other services, such as account management and customer support. Id. ¶¶ 3, 58, 62. Historically, the Company’s revenue has been driven “primarily” by its enterprise customers, id. ¶ 64, which are the Company’s large customers by revenue, see id. ¶ 6.1 Thus, a decline in revenue from the Company’s existing enterprise customers, or a decline in retention of such customers, could create volatility in the Company’s revenue and materially impact Fastly’s business. Id. ¶ 8. Plaintiffs allege that, beginning on November 15, 2023, and throughout the Class Period, Defendants misled investors about the customer pullback and macroeconomic impacts that Fastly was experiencing. For example, on November 15, 2023, Defendant Nightingale allegedly misrepresented to investors that Fastly was not seeing the “slowing in growth” that its competitors were seeing at that time, even though several days earlier he had informed all Fastly employees at an all-hands meeting that the Company’s revenue was “down” because its large customers were reducing their usage and thus were generating less revenue for the Company. See AC ¶¶ 89-91. Plaintiffs allege that this decline in revenue was associated with macroeconomic forces that were ee negatively impacting the Company throughout 2023, which were causing Fastly’s large customers N to become price conscious. See id. ¶¶ 79-80. The Company’s macroeconomic concerns were discussed at all-hands meetings throughout 2023, which typically occurred a week after the Company’s earnings call for each quarter and were attended by all employees and the Company’s C-Suite, including Defendants Nightingale and Kisling (collectively, “individual Defendants”). See id. ¶¶ 79-80, 91. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of Defendants’ misleading statements, Fastly’s stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, which is when they and members of Fastly previously defined “enterprise customers” as those customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the trailing 12-month period, but it currently defines them as those customers with annualized current quarter revenue in excess of $100,000, which is calculated by taking the revenue recognized in the current quarter and multiplying it by four. See AC ¶ 6. the proposed class purchased Fastly securities. Id. ¶¶ 219-27. Plaintiffs further allege that they and members of the proposed class suffered losses when the price of Fastly’s stock decreased following the materialization of certain risks that Defendants concealed from investors, which occurred on February 14, 2024, and when corrective disclosures were made on May 1, 2024, and August 7, 2024. See id. Specifically, on February 14, 2024, Fastly announced its financial results for Q4 2023 and fiscal year 2023 and reported Q4 2023 revenue that was on the lower side of the Company’s guidance for that quarter and missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1%. See id. ¶ 14. The day after the announcement of the Q4 2023 results, Fastly’s stock price fell 30.59%. Id. ¶ 14. Plaintiffs allege that the lower-than-expected revenue for Q4 2023 and resulting plunge in the price of Fastly’s stock were caused by the materialization of the risks of the decreased usage and revenues from the Company’s large customers in Q4 2023 that Defendants had concealed from investors in November 2023. During the earnings call for Q4 2023, Defendant Nightingale allegedly misled investors by attributing the lower-than-expected revenue for Q4 2023 to “weaker than anticipated international traffic” without revealing that it was also due to the decline in usage and revenue from the Company’s large customers in Q4 2023. See id. ¶¶ 20, 130-31. During the ee same call, Defendant Nightingale also allegedly denied that the Company had experienced any N significant macroeconomic impacts during Q4 2023 beyond “deal elongation” even though the Company had experienced reduced usage and revenue from its large customers associated with macroeconomic impacts. Id. ¶ 132. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made additional misleading statements in the annual report for fiscal year 2023, which they issued on February 22, 2024. Id. ¶ 135. May 1, 2024, Defendants released Fastly’s financial results for Q1 2024 and lowered the Company’s revenue guidance for the remainder of 2024 in part because of decreased usage and pricing pressure from the Company’s largest customers. Id. ¶¶ 152-55. Plaintiffs allege that this partially revealed the declines in usage and revenues from Fastly’s large customers and macroeconomic impacts that Defendants had previously concealed and thus constitutes a partial corrective disclosure. Id. ¶¶ 14, 219-27. Plaintiffs allege that, during the earnings call for Q1 2024, Defendants continued to misleadingly tout customer retention and the Company’s efforts to continue to expand existing customers’ usage of Fastly’s services even though the Company was experiencing continued customer pullback and a lack of progress in increasing existing customers’ usage of Fastly’s services. Id. ¶¶ 167-78. The day after the earnings call, analysts downgraded Fastly’s stock, citing the decelerating growth of revenue from its largest customers, and the price of the Company’s stock declined by 32.02%. Id. ¶¶ 163-66. August 7, 2024, Fastly released its financial results for Q2 2024 and decreased for the second time in 2024 Fastly’s revenue guidance for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Id. ¶ 191. During the earnings call for Q2 2024, Defendants disclosed that the Company continued to experience a decline in demand and revenue from its largest customers, and that it was shifting its focus to acquiring new business. Id. ¶¶ 180-90. Plaintiffs allege that this disclosure constituted a corrective disclosure of the revenue and usage declines and macroeconomic impacts that Defendants had previously concealed. See id. ¶¶ 219-27. The day after the earnings call, the price of Fastly’s stock fell 14.33%. Id. ¶ 192. 15 B. Procedural History This action was filed on May 24, 2024, by Plaintiff Ken Kula.

Plaintiffs aver that, starting in 2022, Vicor’s stock slid 20% in value when it was revealed that Nvidia, another tech company, would not be using Vicor’s designs in its new artificial intelligence (“AI”) computer chips. Previously, Vicor’s two largest customers had been Nvidia and Google. May 2023, the company was reporting decreased net revenues and accounts receivable—leading Plaintiffs to take short positions on the company’s stock.

The same 4G Chipset will support a more adept Lateral-Vertical PDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy workloads and superior processor performance.

casd-3_23-cv-01216.pdf,casd,52825,15831,15821,"The Court recites the relevant facts as provided in the complaint and corroborated by a number of confidential witnesses, taking them to be true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. Anktiva is a biologic drug, which means that it is produced from living organisms. Because the process can involve microorganisms, plant cells, or even animal cells, manufacturing biologic products is an especially sensitive process, and producing biologic products “at scale requires a series of highly-technical steps . . . to ensure a consistent end product free from impurities.” AC at ¶ 5. Due to the sensitivity of this process, “even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes can result in significant changes in product composition.” Id. at ¶ 69. Any deviation must “be recorded and justified.” See id. (citing 21 C.F.R. § 211.100). The FDA will not approve a biologic product if its production fails to comply with the FDA’s minimum standards for drug manufacturing, otherwise known as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”). Thus, in order to introduce a biologic drug to the market, a company must file a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). A BLA is composed of “data and supporting materials collected in clinical trials, along with other . 26 . . information on the manner in which the product is manufactured.” This includes 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> “proposed process and protocols for manufacturing at scale, [and] also must include data generated in connection with previously-produced process performance qualification (‘PPQ’) batches using the stated manufacturing processes and equipment.” Id. at ¶ 43. These qualification studies serve “to validate that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of reproducing results within predetermined specifications at commercial scale.” Id. These studies are further corroborated by an FDA inspector’s pre-approval visit to the manufacturing facility. The inspector “observ[es] the site in operation but also [reviews] appropriate records at the facility reflecting past activities.” Id. at ¶ 46. At the conclusion of an inspection, the inspector may issue a “Form 483,” which “memorialize[s] significant deficiencies observed during the inspection that, in the judgment of the inspector[], constitute violations of FDA regulations, including cGMP.” Id. ¶ 64. “After completing its review, the FDA will either approve the BLA or send the sponsor a complete response letter (‘CRL’). A CRL outlines any issues identified by the FDA during the review that prevent approval of the BLA in its current form and, where possible, recommend actions that a sponsor may take to remedy the issues or otherwise position the application for approval.” Id. at ¶ 48 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 601.3(a)). ImmunityBio “was formed in connection with a merger between two clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies controlled by Defendant Soon-Shiong on March 9, 2021,” id. at ¶ 2, and submitted its BLA for Anktiva to the FDA on May 23, 2022, id. at ¶ 7. On May 11, 2023, the FDA rejected the BLA. Id. at ¶ 14. Which came as a surprise to most of the company’s shareholders. Anktiva’s Phase 3 clinical trials had been “impressive,” and in the year leading up to the rejection, ImmunityBio had repeatedly touted its manufacturing capabilities. For instance, ImmunityBio had asserted numerous times in press releases and SEC-mandated disclosures that “[t]he company ha[d] established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale.” See, e.g., id. at ¶ 108. It asserted that for its “Anktiva 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> product candidate, [it had] contracted with a multi-national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities.” See, e.g., id. at ¶ 102. And it asserted that those “facilities ha[d] robust process development and validation and quality oversight.” Id. But shareholders learned on May 11, 2023, that the FDA had rejected Anktiva’s BLA because of deficient manufacturing practices. To shareholders, the news was shocking. But to company executives, the rejection was nothing more than “business disappointment.” ECF No. 50 at 39. For the signs of manufacturing woe had appeared to leadership more than two years prior, as early as March of 2021. ImmunityBio learned of these deficiencies from its contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”), AGC Biologics, Inc., which manufactured the active ingredient in Anktiva. AGC had originated the technique for producing the active ingredient, and ImmunityBio had continued to entrust the process to AGC, as “it would [have] be[en] exceedingly expensive and risky to transfer th[e] technology in-house, particularly with Phase 3 clinical trials . . . .” AC at ¶ 60. Despite its use of a CMO, ImmunityBio remained “ultimately responsible for the manufacture” of Anktiva, a fact it reminded investors of in its SEC disclosures. ECF No. 50-10 at 6. ImmunityBio maintained a “Quality Agreement” with AGC, whereby AGC notified the company of the “findings of any inspection by a government agency,” including any deviations. AC at ¶ 168. Three times, in the two years preceding the BLA’s rejection, ImmunityBio learned that FDA inspectors had observed conditions at the Anktiva facility that violated federal law. ECF No. 50-3 at 2. AGC was first cited for manufacturing deficiencies in March of 2021 during a non-routine FDA inspection. The inspection resulted in a sixteen-item Form 483 that identified numerous deficiencies in Anktiva’s production, including failures “on the part of AGC’s quality unit to adequately investigate deviations, inadequate oversight of manufacturing procedures on the part of the quality unit, lack of adequate documentation for quality control testing, poorly qualified and validated 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> manufacturing processes, and gaps in record keeping such that inspectors could not determine whether manufacturing was operating in a state of control.” Id. at ¶ 65. In response, AGC “committed to implement a CAPA,” a corrective and preventative action, to address the concerns raised in the Form 483. Id. AGC was cited again for manufacturing deficiencies four months later, in July of 2021. The inspection, which was routine, resulted in a three-item Form 483. Id. at ¶ 66. The inspector observed that “the firm either had deficient procedures or failed to follow existing procedures for sanitation, cleaning, and maintenance.” Id. Additionally, the FDA inspector again “condemned AGC’s failure to document conclusions or follow up actions in response to deviations.” Id. Following the receipt of the two Forms 483, ImmunityBio bolstered its Quality Agreement with AGC, requiring that AGC notify ImmunityBio as to any deviation, “even those classified as minor.” Id. at ¶ 169. Through the modified Quality Agreement, ImmunityBio learned that “AGC suffered from myriad cGMP problems, including a recurring inability to timely release batch records, close deviations, [or] conduct stability testing, and [a history of] running out of critical reference material needed for testing.” Id. at ¶ 171. ImmunityBio “began to ‘remind’ AGC at each test window to perform the testing because of the known buildup of misses before the Anktiva BLA,” but “AGC was consistently unable to provide batch records, deviation reports, and stability tests on schedule throughout the Class Period.” Id. at ¶¶ 171–72. These records were “especially ‘important’ to ImmunityBio leadership in 2021 because the results were needed for the Anktiva BLA,” so Defendant Richard Adcock, the CEO of ImmunityBio, began meeting monthly with AGC executives to discuss the delays and other manufacturing deficiencies. Id. at ¶¶ 171–73. Despite leadership’s attention, the issues continued. Even with the addition of costly contract workers, hired and placed by ImmunityBio, AGC “regularly failed” to document departures from written procedures and “regularly failed” to conduct 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> quality control tests. Id. at ¶¶ 67–71, 175. These issues resulted in frequent supply delays for the company’s flagship product that lasted for months. Id. at ¶ 72. ImmunityBio nonetheless forged ahead with its plan to submit the Anktiva BLA, which included AGC’s quality control documentation. The FDA notified AGC on November 1, 2022, that in February 2023, it planned to hold a pre-license inspection at the facility used to manufacture Anktiva. The inspection would last “two weeks and involve six inspectors,” which was far more intense than the typical inspection “conducted by one or two inspectors over several days.” Id. at ¶ 178. ImmunityBio leadership became nervous “upon learning about the scope of the inspection.” Id. Accordingly, they planned a mock inspection for AGC, with extensive involvement from Defendant Adcock. The results were poor. ImmunityBio’s representatives identified several deficiencies in cGMP compliance, including persistent concerns about AGC’s repeated testing delays. These results were presented directly to Defendant Adcock, and ImmunityBio’s leadership was soon “engaged ‘on a very technical level’ with prep for the FDA inspection.” Id. at ¶ 181. The FDA’s pre-license inspection took place from February 2, 2023, to February 10, 2023. ImmunityBio sent at least six representatives to attend the inspection and settled on a plan to update leadership as to the inspection’s progress. Id. at ¶ 182. That plan changed, however, when the FDA observed a number of deficiencies on the very first day of the inspection. Id. at ¶ 183. Overnight, Defendant Adcock flew up to Washington to be present for the next several days of the inspection. Id. Defendant Soon-Shiong demanded a personal call at the end of each day to debrief. Id. He further demanded that ImmunityBio employees be allowed in the room with the inspectors, and AGC eventually agreed to have an employee feed information back to ImmunityBio’s leadership in real time. Id. at ¶ 184. 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> On February 10, 2023, the FDA issued a five-item Form 483. The FDA again cited multiple instances of inadequate deviation management, beginning as early as January 2021. Id. at ¶ 80. Specifically, the FDA observed that AGC failed to promptly address deviations and that most deviations were closed without documenting any conclusions or the implementations of any CAPA. Id. “[L]ess than forty percent of all deviations since July 2021 were closed on schedule, and eighty investigations remained open at the time of the inspection, including several that were open for two years.” Id. FDA inspectors further identified “deficiencies in data integrity, missing validation for computer systems, and lack of reliability of audit trails.” Id. at ¶ 81. They concluded that the site “failed in critical sanitation and contamination-management practices,” finding “violations in pest control in the warehouse area, deficient filtration in a clean corridor, and a pool of standing liquid on the solution prep room floor.” Id. at ¶ 82. And they found that AGC did not follow its own standard operating procedures and that its quality unit failed to adequately oversee manufacturing operations, observing that “for ‘such a critical deviation to occur, quality oversight failed at multiple steps in the process.’” Id. at ¶ 84. On May 11, 2023, the FDA issued a CRL rejecting the Anktiva BLA based on “deficiencies relat[ing] to the FDA’s pre-license inspection of the Company’s third-party contract manufacturing organizations,” and ImmunityBio common stock fell $3.43 per share, or 55.14%. Id. at ¶ 158–59 (emphasis removed). STATEMENTS On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant suit under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, alleging that Defendants misled investors as to ImmunityBio’s compliance with cGMP in its production of Anktiva. Plaintiff challenges two categories of highly repetitive statements, consisting of sixty-two statements in total, issued at regular intervals between March 10, 2021, and May 10, 2023. 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> The first category involves non-risk-factor statements about GMP manufacturing capacity. Plaintiff argues that these statements were misleading because they suggested that Anktiva was not experiencing GMP difficulties, even though Defendants knew from FDA inspectional observations and Quality Agreements that it was. Those statements, with some variation, are as follows: We have established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise and ready-to- scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations and development teams. . . . . For our Anktiva product candidate, we have contracted with a multinational biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and future commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors. . . . . “We are pleased the FDA has begun its review, and ImmunityBio is prepared to move rapidly to manufacturing and marketing should the Agency approve our therapeutic for this indication,” said Richard Adcock, President and CEO of ImmunityBio. See, e.g., AC at ¶¶ 120, 122, 133. The second category involves risk-factor statements. Plaintiff argues that these statements were misleading because they portrayed the risk of production difficulties as merely hypothetical, when in fact that risk had already materialized. Those statements, with some variation, are as follows: The manufacture of our product candidates is complex, and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development, quality control, or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If we or our related parties, or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide adequate supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure. 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> 1 . . . . If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or in accordance with the strict regulatory requirements, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such products. . . . . Our or our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities may be unable to comply with our specifications, cGMP, and with other FDA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements, and there is no guarantee that we or our CMOs will be able to successfully pass all aspects of a pre-approval inspection by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. . . . . As the Company remains focused on preparing for the potential approval of the BLA by the FDA as described above, it intends to continue to explore opportunities to engage in incremental financing transactions to raise the working capital needed to fund the Company’s ongoing operations through the anticipated May 23, 2023 PDUFA date and execute the Company’s business strategy and initiatives. . . . . It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at all. See, e.g., AC at ¶¶ 106, 114, 133, 144.","The Court recites the relevant facts as provided in the complaint and corroborated by a number of confidential witnesses, taking them to be true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. Anktiva is a biologic drug, which means that it is produced from living organisms. Because the process can involve microorganisms, plant cells, or even animal cells, manufacturing biologic products is an especially sensitive process, and producing biologic products “at scale requires a series of highly-technical steps . . . to ensure a consistent end product free from impurities.” AC at ¶ 5. Due to the sensitivity of this process, “even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes can result in significant changes in product composition.” Id. at ¶ 69. Any deviation must “be recorded and justified.” See id. (citing 21 C.F.R. § 211.100). The FDA will not approve a biologic product if its production fails to comply with the FDA’s minimum standards for drug manufacturing, otherwise known as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”). Thus, in order to introduce a biologic drug to the market, a company must file a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). A BLA is composed of “data and supporting materials collected in clinical trials, along with other . 26 . . information on the manner in which the product is manufactured.” This includes 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> “proposed process and protocols for manufacturing at scale, [and] also must include data generated in connection with previously-produced process performance qualification (‘PPQ’) batches using the stated manufacturing processes and equipment.” Id. at ¶ 43. These qualification studies serve “to validate that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of reproducing results within predetermined specifications at commercial scale.” Id. These studies are further corroborated by an FDA inspector’s pre-approval visit to the manufacturing facility. The inspector “observ[es] the site in operation but also [reviews] appropriate records at the facility reflecting past activities.” Id. at ¶ 46. At the conclusion of an inspection, the inspector may issue a “Form 483,” which “memorialize[s] significant deficiencies observed during the inspection that, in the judgment of the inspector[], constitute violations of FDA regulations, including cGMP.” “After completing its review, the FDA will either approve the BLA or send the sponsor a complete response letter (‘CRL’). A CRL outlines any issues identified by the FDA during the review that prevent approval of the BLA in its current form and, where possible, recommend actions that a sponsor may take to remedy the issues or otherwise position the application for approval.” Id. at ¶ 48 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 601.3(a)). ImmunityBio “was formed in connection with a merger between two clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies controlled by Defendant Soon-Shiong on March 9, 2021,” id. at ¶ 2, and submitted its BLA for Anktiva to the FDA on May 23, 2022, id. at ¶ 7. On May 11, 2023, the FDA rejected the BLA. Id. at ¶ 14. Which came as a surprise to most of the company’s shareholders. Anktiva’s Phase 3 clinical trials had been “impressive,” and in the year leading up to the rejection, ImmunityBio had repeatedly touted its manufacturing capabilities. For instance, ImmunityBio had asserted numerous times in press releases and SEC-mandated disclosures that “[t]he company ha[d] established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale.” See, e.g., id. at ¶ 108. It asserted that for its “Anktiva 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> product candidate, [it had] contracted with a multi-national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities.” See, e.g., id. at ¶ 102. And it asserted that those “facilities ha[d] robust process development and validation and quality oversight.” Id. But shareholders learned on May 11, 2023, that the FDA had rejected Anktiva’s BLA because of deficient manufacturing practices. To shareholders, the news was shocking. But to company executives, the rejection was nothing more than “business disappointment.” ECF No. 50 at 39. For the signs of manufacturing woe had appeared to leadership more than two years prior, as early as March of 2021. ImmunityBio learned of these deficiencies from its contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”), AGC Biologics, Inc., which manufactured the active ingredient in Anktiva. AGC had originated the technique for producing the active ingredient, and ImmunityBio had continued to entrust the process to AGC, as “it would [have] be[en] exceedingly expensive and risky to transfer th[e] technology in-house, particularly with Phase 3 clinical trials . . . .” AC at ¶ 60. Despite its use of a CMO, ImmunityBio remained “ultimately responsible for the manufacture” of Anktiva, a fact it reminded investors of in its SEC disclosures. ECF No. 50-10 at 6. ImmunityBio maintained a “Quality Agreement” with AGC, whereby AGC notified the company of the “findings of any inspection by a government agency,” including any deviations. AC at ¶ 168. Three times, in the two years preceding the BLA’s rejection, ImmunityBio learned that FDA inspectors had observed conditions at the Anktiva facility that violated federal law. ECF No. 50-3 at 2. AGC was first cited for manufacturing deficiencies in March of 2021 during a non-routine FDA inspection. The inspection resulted in a sixteen-item Form 483 that identified numerous deficiencies in Anktiva’s production, including failures “on the part of AGC’s quality unit to adequately investigate deviations, inadequate oversight of manufacturing procedures on the part of the quality unit, lack of adequate documentation for quality control testing, poorly qualified and validated 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> manufacturing processes, and gaps in record keeping such that inspectors could not determine whether manufacturing was operating in a state of control.” Id. at ¶ 65. In response, AGC “committed to implement a CAPA,” a corrective and preventative action, to address the concerns raised in the Form 483. Id. AGC was cited again for manufacturing deficiencies four months later, in July of 2021. The inspection, which was routine, resulted in a three-item Form 483. Id. at ¶ 66. The inspector observed that “the firm either had deficient procedures or failed to follow existing procedures for sanitation, cleaning, and maintenance.” Id. Additionally, the FDA inspector again “condemned AGC’s failure to document conclusions or follow up actions in response to deviations.” Id. Following the receipt of the two Forms 483, ImmunityBio bolstered its Quality Agreement with AGC, requiring that AGC notify ImmunityBio as to any deviation, “even those classified as minor.” Id. at ¶ 169. Through the modified Quality Agreement, ImmunityBio learned that “AGC suffered from myriad cGMP problems, including a recurring inability to timely release batch records, close deviations, [or] conduct stability testing, and [a history of] running out of critical reference material needed for testing.” Id. at ¶ 171. ImmunityBio “began to ‘remind’ AGC at each test window to perform the testing because of the known buildup of misses before the Anktiva BLA,” but “AGC was consistently unable to provide batch records, deviation reports, and stability tests on schedule throughout the Class Period.” Id. at ¶¶ 171–72. These records were “especially ‘important’ to ImmunityBio leadership in 2021 because the results were needed for the Anktiva BLA,” so Defendant Richard Adcock, the CEO of ImmunityBio, began meeting monthly with AGC executives to discuss the delays and other manufacturing deficiencies. Id. at ¶¶ 171–73. Despite leadership’s attention, the issues continued. Even with the addition of costly contract workers, hired and placed by ImmunityBio, AGC “regularly failed” to document departures from written procedures and “regularly failed” to conduct 23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Case 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET Document Filed 06/20/24 PageID.<pageID> quality control tests. Id. at ¶¶ 67–71, 175. These issues resulted in frequent supply delays for the company’s flagship product that lasted for months. Id. at ¶ 72.

On September 21, 2023, BAM Trading and BAM Management filed one motion to dismiss, BAM Mot., and Binance and Zhao filed another. Binance Mot. The SEC filed a single opposition (“Mot. Hr’g Tr.”).","Defendant Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company that does business as Binance.com. Compl. ¶ 27. It has operated the internet-based Binance.com international crypto asset trading platform “[s]ince at least July 2017.” Compl. ¶ 27. Defendant Zhao founded, owns, and is the Chief Executive Officer of Binance. Compl. ¶¶ 27, 30. Also known as “CZ,” Zhao is a Canadian citizen who lives outside of the United States. Compl. ¶ 30. Defendant BAM Trading Services is a Delaware corporation that does business as Binance.US. Compl. ¶ 29. It has operated the Binance.US crypto asset internet-based trading platform since 2019. Compl. ¶¶ 7–8, 29. Defendant BAM Management, a Delaware corporation, is the parent of BAM Trading and other affiliated entities. Compl. ¶ 28. When the Binance.US platform launched in 2019, BAM Management was a Cayman Islands company, which was wholly owned by CPZ Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company that Zhao owned and controlled. Compl. ¶ 28. Zhao now owns eighty-one percent of BAM Management. Compl. ¶ 28. Zhao served as chairman of the boards of directors of both BAM Trading and of BAM Management until approximately March 2022. Compl. ¶ 30. Crypto Assets To understand this case, it is appropriate to begin with a description of the assets at issue and the crypto industry in general. A crypto currency is a digital, encrypted, and decentralized medium of exchange, and individual units are often referred to as coins or tokens. See Compl. ¶¶ 62–64. They are traded on electronic platforms such as the Binance.com and Binance.US platforms operated by defendants. Compl. ¶ 73. Crypto assets are transferred and secured using technology known as a “blockchain” or distributed ledger: a database spread across hundreds and even thousands of computer servers that records transactions in digitally recorded data packages called “blocks.” Compl. ¶ 63; Joint Mot. to Dismiss Claims Against Binance and Zhao [Dkt. # 118] (“Binance Mot.”) at 4. There are a number of different blockchain networks in existence, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being two of the most well-known. Binance Mot. at 4. Crypto asset trading platforms operate as a central depository for the crypto assets customers deposit or trade on the platforms. Compl. ¶ 73. Customers’ entitlements are “typically tracked and maintained on the crypto asset trading platform’s internal ledgers,” Compl. ¶ 73, and platforms usually settle transactions by updating internal records with each investor’s positions. Compl. ¶ 76. Because transactions on a blockchain are validated by consensus, rather than by a single entity such as a bank, the blockchains supply a decentralized location for recording transactions. See Compl. ¶¶ 67–68. As the complaint explains, defendants’ crypto asset trading platforms – Binance.com and Binance.US – “are marketplaces that generally offer a variety of services relating to crypto assets, often including brokerage, trading, and settlement services.” Compl. ¶ 71. Both platforms permit their customers to purchase and sell crypto assets using other crypto assets or fiat currency – that is, currency issued by a government. Compl. ¶ 72. One of the concerns underlying this action is that according to plaintiff, Binance.com and Binance.US did not segregate their customers’ crypto assets from other customers’ assets or the firm’s assets. Compl. ¶ 73. Blockchains use cryptographic techniques to secure the recording of transactions, and like many digital systems, they can be subject to hacks. Compl. ¶¶ 63, 65, 349; Notice of BAM Trading of the ledger, a blockchain will rely upon a “consensus mechanism,” the method or protocol that will be utilized to agree on which transactions are valid and when and how to update the blockchain. Compl. ¶¶ 66, 67. Independent users and “validators” apply the protocol to determine whether they agree if a particular transaction is valid, and if the requisite number of them agree, the transaction is processed and recorded on the blockchain. Compl. ¶¶ 66–68, 340; BAM Mot. at 6. The two primary consensus mechanisms that blockchains employ are “proof of work” and “proof of stake.” Compl. ¶ 68. Proof of work, used by the Bitcoin blockchain, involves computers, known as “validator nodes,” that attempt to “mine” a “block” of transactions, in part by solving a complex mathematical problem. Compl. ¶ 68. The first miner to successfully solve the problem earns the right to update the blockchain and is rewarded with the blockchain’s native crypto asset. Compl. ¶ 68. Proof of stake, used by the Ethereum blockchain, involves the selection of block validators from the crypto asset holders who have committed or “staked” a minimum number of crypto assets as part of the validation process. Compl. ¶ 68. Blockchain protocols compensate those participants who validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Compl. ¶¶ 67, 340. The compensation or “rewards” are usually paid in the form of new tokens, and they are funded by various sources, including fees charged to those engaged in transactions on the blockchain or through the blockchain’s creation or “minting” of additional quantities of its native crypto asset. Compl. ¶¶ 67, 340, 341; BAM Mot. at 6. Crypto assets “represented on” their own blockchain are considered “native” to that blockchain, although a blockchain may represent both native and non-native crypto assets. Compl. ¶ 64. Crypto assets are typically stored in a “crypto wallet” – software that enables owners to store and manage the cryptographic information necessary to identify and transfer their assets. Compl. ¶ 65. Crypto wallets allow asset owners to make transactions on the associated blockchains. Compl. ¶ 65. The wallets provide users with a “public key,” which is the user’s blockchain “address” that can be shared with others, and a “private key,” which operates as a password and is needed to transfer a crypto asset. Compl. ¶ 65. Transactions involving the transfer of a crypto asset from one blockchain address to another are called “on-chain” transactions, and those that are only tracked in the internal recordkeeping mechanisms of the platform and do not involve transferring crypto assets from one wallet to another are called “off-chain” transactions. Compl. ¶ 72. The complaint focuses on five of defendants’ crypto assets and programs: • “BNB,” which is also called “Binance Coin,” a crypto asset that was launched on the Binance.com platform in 2017. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 80–81. • “BUSD,” a Binance “stablecoin” that is “purportedly backed with cash (and cash equivalent) reserves and redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars.” Compl. ¶¶ 4, 317. It is “a Binance-branded U.S. Dollar denominated crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain.” Compl. ¶ 31. • Binance’s “Simple Earn,” which is marketed as set of “programs that pay interest to investors who lend their crypto assets to Binance for fixed or flexible lengths of time.” Compl. ¶ 327. • Binance’s “BNB Vault,” a program similar to Simple Earn that is limited to BNB holders and described on Binance.com as a “‘BNB yield aggregator’ whereby investors can lend their BNB to Binance to earn investment returns.” Compl. ¶¶ 4, 328, 331. • BAM Trading’s “Staking Program,” which allows crypto asset owners on the Binance.US platform to pool their assets to collateralize BAM Trading’s validation of transactions on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. See Compl. ¶¶ 4, 339–51. Procedural History On June 6, 2023, the SEC sued defendants for unlawfully soliciting U.S. investors to buy, sell, and trade crypto asset securities through their unregistered trading platforms Binance.com and Binance.US. Compl. ¶ 2.1 It asserts thirteen violations of federal securities laws: The SEC filed a motion for a temporary restraining order the following day. Mot. for TRO was resolved by a June 17, 2024 consent order governing the parties’ conduct and customers’ Count One: Binance violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling BNB without a registration statement. Count Two: Binance violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling BUSD without a registration statement. Count Three: Binance violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling Simple Earn and BNB Vault programs without registration statements. Count Four: BAM Trading violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling its Staking Program without a registration statement. Count Five: Binance violated Exchange Act Section 5 by operating the Binance.com platform without registering as an exchange. Count Six: Binance violated Exchange Act Section 15(a) by operating the Binance.com platform without registering as a broker-dealer. Count Seven: Binance violated Exchange Act Section 17A(b) by operating the Binance.com platform without registering as a clearing agency.

The Parties This case is a putative class action brought by five lead plaintiff investment funds: (i) AltShares Event-Driven ETF, (ii) AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF, (iii) Kryger Fund Ltd., (iv) Kryger Enhanced Fund Ltd. and (v) ODS Capital LLC (together, “Plaintiffs” or “Named Plaintiffs”). (D.I. 19 ¶¶ 26-30). Plaintiffs allege that they were beneficial owners of Focus common stock as of June 9, 2023, the Record Date for the merger at issue here. (Id.). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of “all sellers of Focus common stock who sold their shares from February 27, 2023 through the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2023 [], including those shareholders who held Focus common stock on the Record Date and were entitled to vote on the Merger.” (Id. ¶¶ 20, 233). Defendants are Focus Financial Partners Inc. (“Focus” or “the Company”) and three groups of individuals: (1) the Special Committee Defendants1; (2) the Board Defendants2; and (3) the The Special Committee Defendants are George LeMieux, Elizabeth R. Neuhoff, Greg S. Morganroth, and Joseph R. Feliciani. (D.I. 19 ¶ 36). The Board Defendants include four members of Focus’s Board: Rudy Adolf, Rajini Sundar Kodialam, James D. Carey, Fayez S. Muhtadie. (D.I. 19 ¶ 41). Officer Defendants (together, “the Individual Defendants”).3 Focus is a Delaware-incorporated, New York-headquartered financial services firm that “owns and partners with fiduciary wealth management firms in the Registered Investment Advisor sector.” (Id. ¶ 31). From 2018 to 2023, Focus traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “FOCS.” (Id.). B. The Merger This dispute arises from a merger agreement between Focus and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, a private equity firm (“CD&R”).4 On February 27, 2023, Focus announced it would be acquired by CD&R for approximately $7 billion dollars in a take-private transaction (“the Merger”). (Id. ¶ 1). The Merger, which closed on August 31, 2023, paid Focus shareholders $53 per share. (Id. ¶ 113). In early summer 2022, Focus began canvassing potential bidders on the terms of an acquisition. (Id. ¶ 11-13). Focus representatives contacted CD&R, among others, and by early September 2022, CD&R had proposed a first bid for Focus at $50 per share and entered into due diligence agreements for further information on the Company. (Id. ¶ 11; D.I. 28-2 at 26). On November 1, 2022, the Special Committee was formed, and the Special Committee Defendants began managing the work related to Focus’ acquisition efforts. (D.I. 19 ¶ 119). In later 2022, another bidder emerged: Wealth Enhancement Group (“WEG”). (Id. ¶ 14). By January 17, 2023, pursuant to continued negotiations with both firms, the Special Committee solicited offers at $51.50 and $51.75 per share from CD&R and WEG, respectively. (Id. ¶ 95). The Officer Defendants include Focus’s CEO (Adolf), CFO (James Shanahan), General Counsel (J. Russell McGranahan), and Senior Managing Director and Head of M&A (Leonard Chang). (D.I. 19 ¶ 45). The Complaint details a thorough chronology of many of the events surrounding the transaction in dispute. (See D.I. 19 ¶¶ 52-117). For brevity, the Court provides a summary of relevant facts and will later refer to facts not restated here but nonetheless alleged in the Complaint. CD&R’s bid was supported by months of prior diligence, but WEG’s offer required vetting. (Id. ¶¶ 13, 95-96). By January 30, 2023, after running the bids up to $53 and $55 per share, the Special Committee entered into an exclusivity agreement with CD&R on its offer. (Id. ¶ 97). On February 26, 2023, the Special Committee accepted CD&R’s offer, and, after announcing the Merger on CD&R’s $53 per share proposal, Focus filed a Definitive Proxy on June 12, 2023 (“the Proxy”). (Id. ¶ 123). On July 6, 2023, Focus filed a Supplemental Proxy, and, on July 14, 2023, Focus’ shareholders held a proxy vote approving the Merger. (Id. ¶¶ 114-17; D.I. 28-4 at 8). The Merger closed on August 31, 2023, effecting the $53 per share payout and delisting the Company’s stock consistent with the go-private part of the deal. (D.I. 119 ¶ 117). The Proxy and other pre-close public filings represented that the Merger was the product of a thorough diligence process, negotiated by an independent and disinterested Special Committee, and priced at the best value reasonably obtainable for Focus’ shareholders. (Id. ¶ 5). Plaintiffs claim these disclosures were false and misleading. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege, Defendants orchestrated an insider-preferential acquisition to benefit Defendants and Stone Point Capital (“Stone Point”) – a private equity firm and Focus’ single largest shareholder prior to the Merger. (Id. ¶¶ 7-8). Contrary to their public representations, Plaintiffs allege, Defendants took various steps to steer the Merger process towards CD&R, closing the door to other opportunities which could have garnered the Focus shareholders better value for their investment. (Id. ¶¶ 9, 11-13). To that end, Focus management supposedly “homed in” on CD&R as a partner, keeping other buyers at “arm’s- length.” (Id. ¶¶ 13-14). These efforts later allegedly included enlisting the aid of financial advisors Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman” or “Goldman Sachs”) and Jefferies, LLC (“Jefferies”), to restrict how many interested buyers would be canvassed and to furnish a positive fairness opinion of the Merger, respectively. (Id. ¶ 17). The ultimate effect, allege Plaintiffs, was to craft an “utterly deficient process” that would ensure CD&R succeeded on its $53 per share proposal, enriching the Defendants at the expense of the rest of Focus’ shareholders. (Id. ¶ 18). C. Procedural History On June 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Class Action Complaint. (Id.). The Complaint alleges that Defendants’ conduct in sourcing, negotiating, and executing the Merger violated three provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78(a) et seq. (“Exchange Act”), and attendant regulations: (i) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder; and (iii) Section 20(a). On July 30, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. (D.I. 26). Briefing on the motion was completed on October 29, 2024. (D.I. 27, 30, 32).

(“Goldman” or “Goldman Sachs”) and Jefferies, LLC (“Jefferies”), to restrict how many interested buyers would be canvassed and to furnish a positive fairness opinion of the Merger, respectively. (). The ultimate effect, allege Plaintiffs, was to craft an “utterly deficient process” that would ensure CD&R succeeded on its $53 per share proposal, enriching the Defendants at the expense of the rest of Focus’ shareholders. (). C. Procedural History On June 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Class Action Complaint. (Id.). The Complaint alleges that Defendants’ conduct in sourcing, negotiating, and executing the Merger violated three provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78(a) et seq. (“Exchange Act”), and attendant regulations: (i) Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder; and (iii) Section 20(a). On July 30, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. (D.I. 26). Briefing on the motion was completed on October 29, 2024. (D.I. 27, 30, 32). The Court heard argument on the motion on February 10, 2025. (D.I. 41)."

ilnd-1_20_cv_05593.pdf,ilnd,22983,5677,5677,"The following allegations are taken as true for purposes of this motion. GoHealth operates a technology-driven health insurance marketplace using a combination of websites and licensed agents to help consumers sign up for health insurance with third-party insurance carriers. Leading up to 2020, GoHealth’s revenue primarily came from commissions paid to GoHealth by insurance Consisting of Centerbridge Partners, L.P.; CCP III AIV VII Holdings, L.P; CB Blizzard Co-Invest Holdings, L.P.; Blizzard Aggregator, LLC; Centerbridge Associates III, L.P.; and CCP III Cayman GP Ltd. carrier partners. In particular, GoHealth concentrated on its partnerships with Humana, Inc. (“Humana”) and Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”), which made up for 74% of GoHealth’s total revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (“1Q2019”). (Dkt. 66, at ¶ 12.) GoHealth benefitted from its focus on these carriers because they subsidized GoHealth’s marketing costs, paid top-tier commission rates, and were deeply integrated with GoHealth’s technology platform. GoHealth’s internal metrics reflected the benefits of this strategy in part through a ratio representing commission revenue relative to customer acquisition cost (“LTV/CAC”). LTV is a metric consisting of aggregate commissions over the life of all commissionable approved submissions, based on numerous variables, which include commission rates, carrier mix, and policy persistency. The second portion of the ratio, CAC, represents the costs associated with retaining customers including marketing, advertising, customer care, and enrollment expenses. Plaintiffs contend that GoHealth experienced “best-in-class” LTV/CAC up to the first fiscal quarter of 2020 because its partnerships with Humana and Anthem decreased its direct marketing costs per policy. In July 2020, the Company filed its registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in advance of its initial public offering (“IPO”). In that statement, GoHealth asserted that it would “focus on strengthening the key drivers of LTV/CAC, including marketing costs…” and that its carrier partners “often supplement [its] marketing and technology investments.” (Dkt. 66, at ¶¶ 91–92.) GoHealth further stated that its business model would enable it to “rapidly scale while improving [its] unit economies, as measured by LTV/CAC.” (Id. at ¶ 97.) In addition, it included that “[a]ttracting new carriers” was “critical to the growth of the business,” and it was “strategically adding carriers,” allowing it to “market more efficiently[.]” (Id. at ¶ 98.) GoHealth also obtained revenue from Medicare Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), a type of Medicare Advantage plan for individuals falling into certain special needs categories. GoHealth asserted in its Registration Statement that “increasingly adding SNPs” would “maximize the value of [its] customer interactions and marketing spend[.]” (Id. at ¶ 99.) The Registration Statement also included forty-five pages of “Risk Factors” for investors. (Dkt. 74-2, at 46–91.) In particular, it warned potential investors that LTVs are estimates based on numerous factors, any one of which could negatively affect LTV and the Company’s revenue. Further, it cautioned that the Company relies heavily on carriers owned by Humana and Anthem. If GoHealth were to become dependent on fewer carrier relationships, it may become vulnerable to adverse changes in its relationship with carriers. In addition, it stated that carriers possessed the ability to reduce commission rates, which could affect the Company’s financial condition. Plaintiffs contend that at the time of the IPO, GoHealth suffered negative financial effects because it had maximized its growth with its partners Humana and Anthem. Therefore, before completion of the IPO, GoHealth decided to treat 2020 as an investment year. In effect, GoHealth substantially expanded its insurance carrier base for Medicare and increased its reliance on non- commissionable revenue through SNPs. Plaintiffs contend that these changes caused “significant disruptions to the Company’s critical LTV/CAC metric[.]” (Dkt. 66, at ¶ 88.) Shortly after GoHealth completed the IPO in July 2020, GoHealth officers made statements and released financial data that Plaintiffs assert signaled a shift from its Registration Statement. For example, co-founder, CEO, and Co-Chair of the board Clinton P. Jones (“Jones”) stated on an after-hours earnings call that the Company’s 2Q2020 poor financial results “came in largely as expected” and that the trends existed and were known prior to the IPO. (Id. at ¶ 119.) The call confirmed that decreased customer persistency was consistent with GoHealth’s expectations, including low customer retention and lower effectuation rates. The addition of new carriers also caused higher disenrollment rates, called “churn.” Jones also stated that there was “an initial ramp- up period for new carriers with forecasted lower LTVs as agents learn about the new plans.” (Id. at ¶ 120.) On March 16, 2021, GoHealth filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020 (the “2020 10-K”) with the SEC. (See Dkt. 74-2.) Defendants contend that the 2020 10-K shows that LTV per approved submission for Medicare Advantage increased from 2019 to 2020. Plaintiffs object to the Court’s consideration of the 2020 10-K in their motion to strike, but assert in the alternative that the document states that LTV/CAC for the Medicare Internal segment decreased in part due to “the implementation of new marketing strategies to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions[.]” (Id. at 613.)","The following allegations are taken as true for purposes of this motion. GoHealth operates a technology-driven health insurance marketplace using a combination of websites and licensed agents to help consumers sign up for health insurance with third-party insurance carriers. Leading up to 2020, GoHealth’s revenue primarily came from commissions paid to GoHealth by insurance Consisting of Centerbridge Partners, L.P.; CCP III AIV VII Holdings, L.P; CB Blizzard Co-Invest Holdings, L.P.; Blizzard Aggregator, LLC; Centerbridge Associates III, L.P.; and CCP III Cayman GP Ltd. carrier partners. In particular, GoHealth concentrated on its partnerships with Humana, Inc. (“Humana”) and Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”), which made up for 74% of GoHealth’s total revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (“1Q2019”). (Dkt. 66, at ¶ 12.) GoHealth benefitted from its focus on these carriers because they subsidized GoHealth’s marketing costs, paid top-tier commission rates, and were deeply integrated with GoHealth’s technology platform. GoHealth’s internal metrics reflected the benefits of this strategy in part through a ratio representing commission revenue relative to customer acquisition cost (“LTV/CAC”). LTV is a metric consisting of aggregate commissions over the life of all commissionable approved submissions, based on numerous variables, which include commission rates, carrier mix, and policy persistency. The second portion of the ratio, CAC, represents the costs associated with retaining customers including marketing, advertising, customer care, and enrollment expenses. Plaintiffs contend that GoHealth experienced “best-in-class” LTV/CAC up to the first fiscal quarter of 2020 because its partnerships with Humana and Anthem decreased its direct marketing costs per policy. In July 2020, the Company filed its registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in advance of its initial public offering (“IPO”). In that statement, GoHealth asserted that it would “focus on strengthening the key drivers of LTV/CAC, including marketing costs…” and that its carrier partners “often supplement [its] marketing and technology investments.” (Dkt. 66, at ¶¶ 91–92.) GoHealth further stated that its business model would enable it to “rapidly scale while improving [its] unit economies, as measured by LTV/CAC.” (Id. at ¶ 97.) In addition, it included that “[a]ttracting new carriers” was “critical to the growth of the business,” and it was “strategically adding carriers,” allowing it to “market more efficiently[.]” (Id. at ¶ 98.) GoHealth also obtained revenue from Medicare Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), a type of Medicare Advantage plan for individuals falling into certain special needs categories. GoHealth asserted in its Registration Statement that “increasingly adding SNPs” would “maximize the value of [its] customer interactions and marketing spend[.]” (Id. at ¶ 99.) The Registration Statement also included forty-five pages of “Risk Factors” for investors. (Dkt. 74-2, at 46–91.) In particular, it warned potential investors that LTVs are estimates based on numerous factors, any one of which could negatively affect LTV and the Company’s revenue. Further, it cautioned that the Company relies heavily on carriers owned by Humana and Anthem. If GoHealth were to become dependent on fewer carrier relationships, it may become vulnerable to adverse changes in its relationship with carriers. In addition, it stated that carriers possessed the ability to reduce commission rates, which could affect the Company’s financial condition. Plaintiffs contend that at the time of the IPO, GoHealth suffered negative financial effects because it had maximized its growth with its partners Humana and Anthem. Therefore, before completion of the IPO, GoHealth decided to treat 2020 as an investment year. In effect, GoHealth substantially expanded its insurance carrier base for Medicare and increased its reliance on non- commissionable revenue through SNPs. Plaintiffs contend that these changes caused “significant disruptions to the Company’s critical LTV/CAC metric[.]” (Dkt. 66, at ¶ 88.) Shortly after GoHealth completed the IPO in July 2020, GoHealth officers made statements and released financial data that Plaintiffs assert signaled a shift from its Registration Statement. For example, co-founder, CEO, and Co-Chair of the board Clinton P. Jones (“Jones”) stated on an after-hours earnings call that the Company’s 2Q2020 poor financial results “came in largely as expected” and that the trends existed and were known prior to the IPO. (Id. at ¶ 119.) The call confirmed that decreased customer persistency was consistent with GoHealth’s expectations, including low customer retention and lower effectuation rates. The addition of new carriers also caused higher disenrollment rates, called “churn.” Jones also stated that there was “an initial ramp- up period for new carriers with forecasted lower LTVs as agents learn about the new plans.” (Id. at ¶ 120.) On March 16, 2021, GoHealth filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020 (the “2020 10-K”) with the SEC. (See Dkt. 74-2.) Defendants contend that the 2020 10-K shows that LTV per approved submission for Medicare Advantage increased from 2019 to 2020. Plaintiffs object to the Court’s consideration of the 2020 10-K in their motion to strike, but assert in the alternative that the document states that LTV/CAC for the Medicare Internal segment decreased in part due to “the implementation of new marketing strategies to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions[.]” (Id. at 613.)"

The First Transaction On September 20, 2018, FirstFire loaned DarkPulse $225,000 in exchange for a convertible promissory note (the “2018 Note”) with a principal amount of $247,500 via a securities purchase agreement (the “2018 SPA”) (together with the 2018 Note, the “First Transaction”). ¶¶ 26–27; see Doc. 29-1. The 2018 Note provided an 8% interest rate per annum, a 10% original issue discount, and a nine-month maturity date.3 ¶ 27. The 2018 Note further gave FirstFire the right to convert any portion of the debt for company stock in DarkPulse, at a 30% discount to the market price, beginning 180 days after execution. ¶ 28. It also included a New York forum-selection clause and a Nevada choice-of-law clause.4 Doc. 29- at 16 § 4.6. A microcap company is a publicly traded business with a market capitalization between approximately $50 million and $300 million. An “over-the-counter” market is a decentralized market in which market participants trade stocks or other instruments directly between parties, without a central exchange or broker. A convertible promissory note is a type of debt security that gives the lender, here FirstFire, the right to take repayment of a loan either in cash or in newly-issued company stock. Like an option or warrant, the lender is given the right to purchase company stock at a particular strike price; at conversion, the lender “converts” the note, i.e., it uses the accrued debt to “purchase” the stock instead of receiving cash. See Doc. 29-1 at 3. Specifically, the 2018 Note provides: “This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Note or any other agreement, certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby shall be brought only in the state courts or federal courts located in the state and county of New York. [DarkPulse] hereby irrevocably waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non conveniens.” Id. at 16 § 4.6. <pageID> Pursuant to the conversion option, over a period of approximately one and one-half years, between June 7, 2019 and February 18, 2021, FirstFire effected 18 distinct conversions of debt into newly-issued DarkPulse common stock.5 ¶¶ 29–32. In all, FirstFire exchanged $247,500 worth of debt—the entirety of the principal amount of the 2018 Note—for 879,400,000 shares of stock. ¶ 33. Presently, the estimated open market value of the stock acquired by FirstFire from converting debt under the 2018 Note totals $10,738,900. ¶ 34. In the days following each FirstFire conversion, the average daily trading volume in DarkPulse stock increased dramatically. Id. Thirty days prior to FirstFire’s first conversion, for example, DarkPulse had a trading volume (i.e., the total number of shares traded during a given period) of 4,646,131. Id. Ten days following the June 7, 2019 conversion, that figure nearly doubled to 8,235,159 trades. Id. And ten days following the June 24, 2019 conversion, the figure rose to 12,059,811 trades. Id.

See Doc. 32-1.7 The August GHS Agreement granted DarkPulse the right to sell to GHS up to $45,000,000 worth of shares of DarkPulse common stock at variable rates from time to time at DarkPulse’s discretion. See Doc. 32-1 at 21. On November 9, 2021, DarkPulse entered into a second purchase agreement with GHS (the “November GHS Agreement,” together with the August GHS Agreement, the “GHS Agreements”) granting DarkPulse the right to sell to GHS up to an additional $30,000,000 worth of shares of DarkPulse common stock at variable rates from time to time at DarkPulse’s discretion.

Fireman presented O’Leary with a one-page “Amendment No. 1 to the Convertible Promissory Note Issued on April 26, 2021” (the “Amendment”), claiming that it would enable DarkPulse to complete future acquisitions without having to notify O’Leary. Id.; see Doc. 32-6.8 Fireman did not mention to O’Leary that the Amendment replaced both the New York choice-of- law and forum-selection provisions of the 2021 Note with Delaware provisions. ¶ 47. The Amendment consists of the following four provisions: 1. Remove from the Securities Purchase Agreement Section 4. Subsection d . . . . 2. Governing Law; Venue. The Transaction Documents shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Note, the Warrant, or any other agreement, certificate, instrument, or document contemplated hereby shall be brought only in the state courts of Delaware or in the federal courts located in the state of Delaware. The parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non conveniens. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY . . . . 3. The Parties have mutually agreed to the provisions set forth herein and are doing so without the exchange or any additional consideration . . . . 4. This Amendment shall be deemed part of, but shall take precedence over and supersede any provisions to the contrary contained in the Note. Except as specifically modified hereby, all of the provisions of the Note, which are not in conflict with the terms of this Amendment, shall remain in full force and effect. The Court takes judicial notice of the Amendment as incorporated into the FAC by reference. See ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d at 98. <pageID> Doc. 32-6 at 2–3.

nysd_23_cv_9476.pdf,nysd,83604,22893,22671,"A. Factual Background 1. The Parties Genesee is a public pension fund based in Flint, Michigan, with assets of about $250 million managed for the benefit of more than 1,000 participants. This Opinion draws its facts from the Amended Complaint (“AC” (Dkt. #43)), the well- pleaded allegations of which are taken as true for purposes of this Opinion. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). For ease of reference, the Court refers to Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss as “Def. Br.” (Dkt. #61); to Defendant Capone’s joinder to the motion to dismiss as “Capone Br.” (Dkt. #63); to Plaintiff’s memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants’ motions to dismiss as “Pl. Opp.” (Dkt. #65); to Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s reply memorandum of law in further support of their motion as “Def. Reply” (Dkt. #68); and to Defendant Capone’s joinder to the reply brief as “Capone Reply” (Dkt. #72). The Court also relies, as appropriate, on certain of the exhibits attached to the Declaration of Jason J. Mendro (“Mendro Decl., Ex. [ ]” (Dkt. #62)), submitted in concert with Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s motion to dismiss, as well as certain exhibits attached to the Declaration of Christopher M. Wood (“Wood Decl., Ex [ ]” (Dkt. #65-1)), submitted in concert with Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to dismiss. Nearly all documents relied upon in the Court’s analysis, including the aforementioned exhibits, are either documents incorporated by reference in the Amended Complaint or documents required by law to be filed — and actually filed — with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., 622 F.3d (AC ¶ 14). Genesee allegedly purchased DocGo common stock between November 5, 2021, and September 15, 2023 (the “Class Period”). (Id.). Defendant DocGo is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New York. (AC ¶ 15). DocGo offers medical transportation and mobile health services in the United States and the United Kingdom. (Id.). As of December 31, 2023, DocGo had 104,055,168 shares of common stock outstanding. (Id.). DocGo’s common stock trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DCGO.” (Id.). Defendant Vashovsky is the co-founder of DocGo, and served as DocGo’s CEO until January 2023. (AC ¶ 16). He has served as the Chairman of DocGo’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) since 2015. (Id.).3 Defendant Capone joined Ambulnz, Inc. (“Ambulnz”) in 2017, where he served as President, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Product Officer until Ambulnz’s merger with Motion Acquisition Corp. (“Motion”), to form DocGo, in 2021. (AC ¶ 17). Capone served as DocGo’s President until January 2023, and thereafter as its CEO until his resignation in September 2023. (Id.). 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining that on a motion to dismiss, courts may consider documents incorporated by reference in the complaint); Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991) (explaining that a court may take judicial notice of documents “required by law to be filed, and actually filed, with the SEC”). The exception is Exhibit 5 to the Declaration of Jason J. Mendro. However, the Court finds that it can still take judicial notice of the document because it is a screenshot from an official government website. See, e.g., Rynasko v. New York Univ., 63 F.4th 186, 191 n.4 (2d Cir. 2023) (“When considering a motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)[,] we may take judicial notice of documents from official government websites.” (quotation WL 4759737, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2018) (taking judicial notice of screenshots from websites when neither party questioned their authenticity). According to Defendants, Vashovsky has retired and stepped down as director and Chairman of the Board, effective March 31, 2024. (Def. Br. 4 n.2). Defendant Oberholzer served as DocGo’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) from 2015 until January 2023. (AC ¶ 18). In January 2023, Oberholzer became DocGo’s Treasurer and Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. (Id.). 2. DocGo’s Formation and Business Development DocGo began as Motion, a blank check company generated from a collaboration between executives in the transportation software and technology sectors. (AC ¶ 26). As is common for blank check companies, Motion did not initially have its own operations or business, but rather was used as a vehicle to raise money from investors ahead of an initial public offering (“IPO”), the proceeds of which Motion intended to use to acquire a business or operational assets. (Id.). Motion completed its IPO on October 19, 2020. (Id. ¶ 27). On January 6, 2021, Motion signed a letter of intent to combine with Ambulnz, which was then a private company. (AC ¶ 28). On March 8, 2021, Motion and Ambulnz entered into a business combination agreement, which was announced on March 9, 2021. (Id.). Several months later, on October 14, 2021, Motion filed a final proxy for the merger with the SEC, which proxy recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the business combination. (Id.). Motion’s shareholders approved the plan the following month, and the business combination’s completion was announced via press release on November 5, 2021. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29). The upshot of these transactions was that Ambulnz was merged with and into a subsidiary of Motion, with Motion as the surviving entity, and Motion’s name changed to DocGo Inc. (Id. ¶ 29). Motion, in turn, assumed the business and operations of Ambulnz, allowing Ambulnz to become publicly traded as DocGo. (Id.). Once formed, DocGo provided healthcare transportation and mobile services for hospitals and health systems, health plans, governments, and municipalities in the United States and the United Kingdom. (AC ¶ 25). DocGo is comprised of two operating segments: (i) Transportation Services, which includes emergency response and non-emergency transport services; and (ii) Mobile Health Services (“Mobile Health”), which includes “services performed at home and offices, testing, vaccinations, and event services.” (Id. ¶ 2). From its formation, DocGo sought to promote itself as a company positioned at the intersection of healthcare and technology. (AC ¶ 31). Simultaneous with DocGo’s development, the market was beginning to recognize artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities as an important differentiator among companies. (Id. ¶¶ 32-33). DocGo sought to capitalize on this momentum by emphasizing its own technological “backbone,” which included a “proprietary central AI system that managed the logistics behind DocGo’s scheduling, patient interactions, and resource allocation.” (Id. ¶ 34). DocGo also represented itself as one of the few public companies committed to bringing healthcare to underserved populations. (Id. ¶ 3). DocGo’s growth — and, particularly, the growth of its Mobile Health and Government segments (or “verticals”) — was initially aided by the surge of testing and other services related to the COVID-19 pandemic. (AC ¶ 50). However, as the pandemic wound down in late 2022 and early 2023, DocGo sought to transition its Mobile Health division away from COVID-19-centric business and into a broader array of population health services. (Id.). One way that DocGo did so was by seeking government contracts. (Id.). In May 2023, this effort bore fruit, as DocGo was awarded a $432 million no-bid contract with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (the “HPD”) to provide services to asylum-seeking migrants in conjunction with New York City’s practice of relocating such migrants. (Id. ¶ 55). This was the largest contract DocGo had ever received from a government body and nearly matched the Company’s total reported revenue for 2022. (Id.). Soon after the HPD contract began, however, reports surfaced of “DocGo’s disruptive behavior in the communities in which the Company had relocated migrants.” (AC ¶ 56). As a result, DocGo began receiving negative media attention. For instance, on July 18, 2023, the Times Union reported that hotel guests at a Super 8 in Rotterdam, New York, had been abruptly cleared out of their rooms without notice before DocGo transported migrants there. (Id.). And The New York Times reported on July 30, 2023, about issues with DocGo’s relocation program. (Id. ¶ 57). This media attention fueled public scrutiny of DocGo, and on August 8, 2023, elected officials in Albany called on DocGo to improve its operations. (Id. ¶ 59). 3. The Alleged Misrepresentations The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants made a series of misstatements during DocGo’s formation and development that negatively impacted shareholders. The Court briefly outlines each category of alleged misstatements. a. The Education Statements The first set of alleged misrepresentations relate to Capone’s educational background (the “Education Statements”). Even before DocGo was created, Capone claimed to have earned a “Masters of Computational Learning Theory from Clarkson University,” and to have graduated summa cum laude from SUNY College at Potsdam with degrees in computer science, philosophy, and law. (AC ¶ 37). However, Capone had earned no such graduate degree from Clarkson University — in fact, he had not earned a graduate degree from any university in any subject. (Id. ¶ 45). Nor had Capone graduated with a “triple summa cum laude undergraduate degree from SUNY Potsdam.” (Id.). Despite never attending graduate school, Capone routinely touted his non-existent graduate degree in computer science to prospective investors, thereby seeking to tie his experience (and, by extension, DocGo’s) with the burgeoning AI movement. The first such instance described in the Amended Complaint occurred on June 16, 2021, prior to the formation of DocGo. While working at Ambulnz, Capone submitted a “Proposal to the New Jersey Department of Health Office of the Commissioner” on the company’s behalf. (AC ¶ 37). This proposal included Capone’s resume, which stated that Capone had earned a Masters of Computational Learning Theory from Clarkson University in May 2014 and graduated triple summa cum laude from SUNY Potsdam in May 2009. (Id.). Also prior to the formation of DocGo, Capone had appeared on the “AI in Action” podcast, which was broadcast on YouTube on September 9, 2021. (Id. ¶ 70). During his interview, Capone discussed his longtime interest in coding, and explained that his academic career culminated in his “graduate degree in computational learning theory.” (Id.). Once at DocGo, Capone continued to perpetuate the falsehoods concerning his academic credentials. (AC ¶ 69). In particular, Capone touted his graduate degree in computational learning theory to investors, customers, and the public in service of his efforts to “boost DocGo’s prospects and capabilities.” (Id. ¶ 36). For example, on September 13, 2022, Capone presented at the H.C. Wainwright Global Investment Conference. When describing his background, he stated that his “graduate degree is in computational learning theory, which was a subset of artificial intelligence.” (Id. ¶ 73). The next day, when presenting at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference, Capone reiterated this falsehood as part of his introductory remarks. (Id. ¶ 74). And on October 19, 2022, Capone participated in one of Impetus Digital’s Fireside Chats and, when speaking about DocGo, stated: Well we built out our own software. It’s called Dara, which entirely focuses on utilization, it’s routing optimization, it really leverages that AI. It’s kind of the intellectual reason I guess that I joined the company was that I had the ability to apply my academic training to a very particular circumstance of how do we have the ability to make sure the ambulances are running? (Id. ¶¶ 75-76 (emphasis in original)). These false statements persisted well into 2023, as Capone continued to emphasize his non-existent degree(s) at various conferences, including: (i) the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, held on January 12, 2023; (ii) the Cowen Healthcare Conference, held on March 7, 2023; (iii) the Oppenheimer Healthcare Conference, held on March 15, 2023; and (iv) the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference, held on August 3, 2023. (AC ¶¶ 80-83, 85). Capone’s statements at the Oppenheimer Healthcare Conference are illustrative of the general tenor of these remarks: DocGo, when you look at its heart, is really a technology company. From day one when we built the company, that was going to be our focus. And that’s actually my background. My degree is in artificial intelligence. That’s what I went to graduate school for. And from day one, we built out all of our own technology in-house, and not just technology that sometimes you say I need to have as a service company. (Id. ¶ 83). As indicated by the quoted passages, Capone’s statements were frequently interwoven with comments about DocGo’s founding or the uniqueness of the Company’s technology. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 80-83). Capone’s misstatements also found their way into documents filed by DocGo with the SEC. (AC ¶ 72). For example, on April 29, 2022, DocGo filed a proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC in advance of the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. (Id.). The proxy statement included biographical information for each executive officer at the company, including Capone. Specifically, the document stated: “Mr. Capone earned his undergraduate degree from the State University of New York College at Potsdam and his M.S. in Computer Science from Clarkson University.” (Id.). On November 7, 2022, DocGo filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8- K, reporting that Vashovsky was retiring and announcing that Capone had been appointed by the Board to succeed Vashovsky as CEO. (Id. ¶ 77). The Form 8-K discussed Capone’s background, including his academic credentials, and once again represented that he earned a “M.S.” from Clarkson University. Finally, on April 26, 2023, DocGo filed a proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC in advance of the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, which statement included the same false biographical information. (Id. ¶ 84). b. The Interview Statements The Amended Complaint also alleges that Capone made a series of false and misleading statements at the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference, which was held on August 9, 2023. (AC ¶ 89). The first of these statements dealt with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) contract that DocGo wished to obtain (the “CBP Statements”). In the course of the interview, Capone stated: But even more confidence in the existing lines of business with just New York, New York City with multiple asylum seeking programs, we did this in large part because it gave us all of the credibility to win the border patrol RFP, which we’ve been working on for seven to eight months. And that’s a five-year contract worth o[ve]r $4 billion that contract is. Almost $1 billion a year, that contract is worth. And that one allows us to treat all the asylum seekers as soon as they come across the border and that 72 hour st[i]nt, and we’ve been working on that for a very long time. (Id. (emphasis omitted)). The Amended Complaint alleges that this statement was false for multiple reasons, including: (i) the contract with CBP was not valued at “o[ve]r $4 billion”; and (ii) given the criticism of DocGo regarding its administration of the HPD contract, Capone did not believe and had no reason to believe that the HPD contract gave DocGo “all of the credibility to win the border patrol RFP.” (Id. ¶ 90). At the same conference, Capone is also alleged to have made false representations regarding DocGo’s efforts to sign migrants up for New York State Medicaid (the “Medicaid Statements”). In particular, he stated: “We’ve already signed up over 3,000 asylum seekers onto New York State Medicaid through United Healthcare.” (AC ¶ 91).4 Capone went on to explain that “United Healthcare” has a contract with New York State, and so DocGo has “the ability to enroll [asylum seekers] in United’s managed care program.” (Id.). Capone underscored the significance of these enrollments, and of the contract with UnitedHealthcare, to DocGo’s post-pandemic business strategy: And now because we sign them up, now we have the ability to become their primary care provider and treat the preventable diseases on a long-term basis, being able to eventually get this per-member, per-month reimbursement because we are now comprehensively taking their care. United has that managed Medicaid contract with New York State. And so we have the ability to enroll [asylum seekers] in United’s managed care program. But in doing so, we become their attributed PCP and we can begin . . . to provide care for them on a long-term basis. So even post this municipal contract or this person’s existence in that municipal contract, we can see long term revenue streams that come from it. And this is the first time we’re really showing how the municipal sector Though the company’s name is UnitedHealthcare, it is presented in several forms in the relevant documents. has long term revenue opportunity in our payer vertical because it gives member attribution at no cost. (Id. ¶¶ 60-61). Plaintiff alleges that these statements were false because DocGo did not enroll anyone in New York State Medicaid programs, nor did DocGo have a contract with UnitedHealthcare in New York whereby it could enroll asylum seekers in UnitedHealthcare’s managed care program. (Id. ¶ 92). Of potential note, the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference was held on August 9, 2023, only one day after Albany legislators had held a press conference in which they publicly criticized DocGo’s operations. (AC ¶ 59). The Amended Complaint accordingly alleges that “[r]eeling from” the mounting public criticisms of DocGo, “Capone sought to reassure investors about the Company’s performance and future prospects” by inflating the value of the CBP contract and by making false statements about DocGo’s ability to sign asylum seekers up for Medicaid. (Id. ¶¶ 59, 66-68). Capone’s public statements, it turns out, had the opposite effect: In the wake of the conference, the Times Union published an article on September 10, 2023, titled: “DocGo CEO’s comments on migrant contracts appear inaccurate.” (AC ¶ 8). This article alleged that the CBP contract was worth far less than Capone had represented. (Id.). The Times Union also reported that Capone’s statements to investors about signing migrants onto Medicaid were false. (Id.). On that point, the article contained statements from: (i) representatives of DocGo’s own public relations firm, which confirmed that “DocGo does not enroll anyone in Medicaid programs, nor do we make any determinations regarding who qualifies for Medicaid programs,” and, further, that “DocGo does not ‘sign up’ anyone for Medicaid and assignment as a primary care provider is not a ‘byproduct’ of this process”; (ii) UnitedHealthcare, which confirmed that the company had no contract with DocGo in New York; and (iii) the New York State Department of Health, which confirmed that “a provider can only receive a per-member, per-month reimbursement from Medicaid through a contractual agreement with a managed care plan,” which DocGo lacked with UnitedHealthcare. (Mendro Decl., Ex. 4 at 3; see also id. ¶¶ 8, 68, 94). After the article was published, the price of DocGo’s common stock declined by more than 10%, from a close of $7.06 on September 8, 2023, to a low of $6.30 on September 11, 2023. (AC ¶ 95). On September 14, 2023, the Times Union published another article, this one titled: “No record that DocGo CEO Anthony Capone earned graduate degree.” (AC ¶ 96). In this article, Capone admitted that he did “not have a master’s degree from Clarkson University, nor from any other institution.” (Id.). On September 15, 2023, after the markets closed, DocGo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing Capone’s immediate resignation for “personal reasons.” (Id. ¶ 97). Upon this news, the price of DocGo common stock declined by more than 25%, from a high of $6.53 on September 14, 2023, to a low of $4.88 on September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶ 98). This action followed shortly thereafter, alleging securities fraud that resulted in losses for those who purchased DocGo common stock between November 5, 2021, and September 15, 2023. (Id. ¶ 1). B. Procedural Background The initial complaint in this action was filed on October 27, 2023, by Joe Naclerio, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated. (Dkt. #1). On November 3, 2023, this Court ordered that Naclerio advise in writing the date and manner in which he published notice of his suit, as required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). (Dkt. #7 (citing U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(A))). Naclerio filed a response on November 16, 2023. (Dkt. #8). The Court thereafter ordered that any motions to serve as lead plaintiffs be filed by December 26, 2023, and that any opposition to any motion for appointment of lead plaintiff be served and filed by January 11, 2024. (Dkt. #9, 10). In accordance with the Court’s schedule, on December 26, 2023, Naclerio and Genesee filed motions seeking appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of their selection of lead counsel. (Dkt. #11, 15). On January 11, 2024, Naclerio filed a notice of non-opposition in response to Genesee’s motion. (Dkt. #20). In light of Naclerio’s notice of non-opposition, the Court appointed Genesee as lead plaintiff and approved of its selection of lead counsel, determining that Genesee had satisfied the requirements for appointment of lead plaintiff pursuant to Section 21D(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the PSLRA. (Dkt. #29, 30). The parties proceeded to submit a proposed briefing schedule on Defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss, which schedule the Court endorsed. (Dkt. #33). In accordance with the parties’ briefing schedule, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint, the operative pleading in this action, on March 20, 2024. (Dkt. #43). On June 21, 2024, Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer filed their motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. #60-62). Defendant Capone filed a motion joining Sections I(B), II, III(B), and IV of his co-defendants’ memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss. (Dkt. #63). Plaintiff filed their opposition on August 20, 2024. (Dkt. #65). And on September 19, 2024, Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer filed their reply brief in further support of their motion to dismiss. (Dkt. #68). Defendant Capone also filed a reply in further support of his motion to dismiss and joined Sections I(B), I(C), I(D), II (except for the paragraphs captioned “Education Statements”), III, and IV of his co-defendants’ reply brief. (Dkt. #72).","A. Factual Background 1. The Parties Genesee is a public pension fund based in Flint, Michigan, with assets of about $250 million managed for the benefit of more than 1,000 participants. This Opinion draws its facts from the Amended Complaint (“AC” (Dkt. #43)), the well- pleaded allegations of which are taken as true for purposes of this Opinion. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). For ease of reference, the Court refers to Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss as “Def. Br.” (Dkt. #61); to Defendant Capone’s joinder to the motion to dismiss as “Capone Br.” (Dkt. #63); to Plaintiff’s memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants’ motions to dismiss as “Pl. Opp.” (Dkt. #65); to Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s reply memorandum of law in further support of their motion as “Def. Reply” (Dkt. #68); and to Defendant Capone’s joinder to the reply brief as “Capone Reply” (Dkt. #72). The Court also relies, as appropriate, on certain of the exhibits attached to the Declaration of Jason J. Mendro (“Mendro Decl., Ex. [ ]” (Dkt. #62)), submitted in concert with Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer’s motion to dismiss, as well as certain exhibits attached to the Declaration of Christopher M. Wood (“Wood Decl., Ex [ ]” (Dkt. #65-1)), submitted in concert with Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to dismiss. Nearly all documents relied upon in the Court’s analysis, including the aforementioned exhibits, are either documents incorporated by reference in the Amended Complaint or documents required by law to be filed — and actually filed — with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., 622 F.3d (AC ¶ 14). Genesee allegedly purchased DocGo common stock between November 5, 2021, and September 15, 2023 (the “Class Period”). (Id.). Defendant DocGo is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New York. (AC ¶ 15). DocGo offers medical transportation and mobile health services in the United States and the United Kingdom. (Id.). As of December 31, 2023, DocGo had 104,055,168 shares of common stock outstanding. (Id.). DocGo’s common stock trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DCGO.” (Id.). Defendant Vashovsky is the co-founder of DocGo, and served as DocGo’s CEO until January 2023. (AC ¶ 16). He has served as the Chairman of DocGo’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) since 2015. (Id.).3 Defendant Capone joined Ambulnz, Inc. (“Ambulnz”) in 2017, where he served as President, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Product Officer until Ambulnz’s merger with Motion Acquisition Corp. (“Motion”), to form DocGo, in 2021. (AC ¶ 17). Capone served as DocGo’s President until January 2023, and thereafter as its CEO until his resignation in September 2023. (Id.). 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining that on a motion to dismiss, courts may consider documents incorporated by reference in the complaint); Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991) (explaining that a court may take judicial notice of documents “required by law to be filed, and actually filed, with the SEC”). The exception is Exhibit 5 to the Declaration of Jason J. Mendro. However, the Court finds that it can still take judicial notice of the document because it is a screenshot from an official government website. See, e.g., Rynasko v. New York Univ., 63 F.4th 186, 191 n.4 (2d Cir. 2023) (“When considering a motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)[,] we may take judicial notice of documents from official government websites.” (quotation WL 4759737, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2018) (taking judicial notice of screenshots from websites when neither party questioned their authenticity). According to Defendants, Vashovsky has retired and stepped down as director and Chairman of the Board, effective March 31, 2024. (Def. Br. 4 n.2). Defendant Oberholzer served as DocGo’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) from 2015 until January 2023. (AC ¶ 18). In January 2023, Oberholzer became DocGo’s Treasurer and Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Strategy. (Id.). 2.

For example, on April 29, 2022, DocGo filed a proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC in advance of the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. (Id.). The proxy statement included biographical information for each executive officer at the company, including Capone. Specifically, the document stated: “Mr. Capone earned his undergraduate degree from the State University of New York College at Potsdam and his M.S. in Computer Science from Clarkson University.” (Id.). On November 7, 2022, DocGo filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8- K, reporting that Vashovsky was retiring and announcing that Capone had been appointed by the Board to succeed Vashovsky as CEO. (). The Form 8-K discussed Capone’s background, including his academic credentials, and once again represented that he earned a “M.S.” from Clarkson University. Finally, on April 26, 2023, DocGo filed a proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC in advance of the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, which statement included the same false biographical information. (). b. The Interview Statements The Amended Complaint also alleges that Capone made a series of false and misleading statements at the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference, which was held on August 9, 2023. (AC ¶ 89). The first of these statements dealt with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) contract that DocGo wished to obtain (the “CBP Statements”). In the course of the interview, Capone stated: But even more confidence in the existing lines of business with just New York, New York City with multiple asylum seeking programs, we did this in large part because it gave us all of the credibility to win the border patrol RFP, which we’ve been working on for seven to eight months. And that’s a five-year contract worth o[ve]r $4 billion that contract is. Almost $1 billion a year, that contract is worth. And that one allows us to treat all the asylum seekers as soon as they come across the border and that 72 hour st[i]nt, and we’ve been working on that for a very long time. (Id. (emphasis omitted)). The Amended Complaint alleges that this statement was false for multiple reasons, including: (i) the contract with CBP was not valued at “o[ve]r $4 billion”; and (ii) given the criticism of DocGo regarding its administration of the HPD contract, Capone did not believe and had no reason to believe that the HPD contract gave DocGo “all of the credibility to win the border patrol RFP.” (). At the same conference, Capone is also alleged to have made false representations regarding DocGo’s efforts to sign migrants up for New York State Medicaid (the “Medicaid Statements”). In particular, he stated: “We’ve already signed up over 3,000 asylum seekers onto New York State Medicaid through United Healthcare.” (AC ¶ 91).4 Capone went on to explain that “United Healthcare” has a contract with New York State, and so DocGo has “the ability to enroll [asylum seekers] in United’s managed care program.” (Id.). Capone underscored the significance of these enrollments, and of the contract with UnitedHealthcare, to DocGo’s post-pandemic business strategy: And now because we sign them up, now we have the ability to become their primary care provider and treat the preventable diseases on a long-term basis, being able to eventually get this per-member, per-month reimbursement because we are now comprehensively taking their care. United has that managed Medicaid contract with New York State. And so we have the ability to enroll [asylum seekers] in United’s managed care program. But in doing so, we become their attributed PCP and we can begin . . . to provide care for them on a long-term basis. So even post this municipal contract or this person’s existence in that municipal contract, we can see long term revenue streams that come from it. And this is the first time we’re really showing how the municipal sector Though the company’s name is UnitedHealthcare, it is presented in several forms in the relevant documents. has long term revenue opportunity in our payer vertical because it gives member attribution at no cost. (). Plaintiff alleges that these statements were false because DocGo did not enroll anyone in New York State Medicaid programs, nor did DocGo have a contract with UnitedHealthcare in New York whereby it could enroll asylum seekers in UnitedHealthcare’s managed care program. (). Of potential note, the Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference was held on August 9, 2023, only one day after Albany legislators had held a press conference in which they publicly criticized DocGo’s operations. (AC ¶ 59). The Amended Complaint accordingly alleges that “[r]eeling from” the mounting public criticisms of DocGo, “Capone sought to reassure investors about the Company’s performance and future prospects” by inflating the value of the CBP contract and by making false statements about DocGo’s ability to sign asylum seekers up for Medicaid. (, 66-68). Capone’s public statements, it turns out, had the opposite effect: In the wake of the conference, the Times Union published an article on September 10, 2023, titled: “DocGo CEO’s comments on migrant contracts appear inaccurate.” (AC ¶ 8). This article alleged that the CBP contract was worth far less than Capone had represented. (Id.). The Times Union also reported that Capone’s statements to investors about signing migrants onto Medicaid were false. (Id.). On that point, the article contained statements from: (i) representatives of DocGo’s own public relations firm, which confirmed that “DocGo does not enroll anyone in Medicaid programs, nor do we make any determinations regarding who qualifies for Medicaid programs,” and, further, that “DocGo does not ‘sign up’ anyone for Medicaid and assignment as a primary care provider is not a ‘byproduct’ of this process”; (ii) UnitedHealthcare, which confirmed that the company had no contract with DocGo in New York; and (iii) the New York State Department of Health, which confirmed that “a provider can only receive a per-member, per-month reimbursement from Medicaid through a contractual agreement with a managed care plan,” which DocGo lacked with UnitedHealthcare. (Mendro Decl., Ex. 4 at 3; see also id. ¶¶ 8, 68, 94). After the article was published, the price of DocGo’s common stock declined by more than 10%, from a close of $7.06 on September 8, 2023, to a low of $6.30 on September 11, 2023. (AC ¶ 95). On September 14, 2023, the Times Union published another article, this one titled: “No record that DocGo CEO Anthony Capone earned graduate degree.” (AC ¶ 96). In this article, Capone admitted that he did “not have a master’s degree from Clarkson University, nor from any other institution.” (Id.). On September 15, 2023, after the markets closed, DocGo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing Capone’s immediate resignation for “personal reasons.” (). Upon this news, the price of DocGo common stock declined by more than 25%, from a high of $6.53 on September 14, 2023, to a low of $4.88 on September 18, 2023. (). This action followed shortly thereafter, alleging securities fraud that resulted in losses for those who purchased DocGo common stock between November 5, 2021, and September 15, 2023. (). B. Procedural Background The initial complaint in this action was filed on October 27, 2023, by Joe Naclerio, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated. (Dkt. #1). On November 3, 2023, this Court ordered that Naclerio advise in writing the date and manner in which he published notice of his suit, as required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). (Dkt. #7 (citing U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(A))). Naclerio filed a response on November 16, 2023. (Dkt. #8). The Court thereafter ordered that any motions to serve as lead plaintiffs be filed by December 26, 2023, and that any opposition to any motion for appointment of lead plaintiff be served and filed by January 11, 2024. (Dkt. #9, 10). In accordance with the Court’s schedule, on December 26, 2023, Naclerio and Genesee filed motions seeking appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of their selection of lead counsel. (Dkt. #11, 15). On January 11, 2024, Naclerio filed a notice of non-opposition in response to Genesee’s motion. (Dkt. #20). In light of Naclerio’s notice of non-opposition, the Court appointed Genesee as lead plaintiff and approved of its selection of lead counsel, determining that Genesee had satisfied the requirements for appointment of lead plaintiff pursuant to Section 21D(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the PSLRA. (Dkt. #29, 30). The parties proceeded to submit a proposed briefing schedule on Defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss, which schedule the Court endorsed. (Dkt. #33). In accordance with the parties’ briefing schedule, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint, the operative pleading in this action, on March 20, 2024. (Dkt. #43). On June 21, 2024, Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer filed their motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. #60-62). Defendant Capone filed a motion joining Sections I(B), II, III(B), and IV of his co-defendants’ memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss. (Dkt. #63). Plaintiff filed their opposition on August 20, 2024. (Dkt. #65). And on September 19, 2024, Defendants DocGo, Vashovsky, and Oberholzer filed their reply brief in further support of their motion to dismiss. (Dkt. #68). Defendant Capone also filed a reply in further support of his motion to dismiss and joined Sections I(B), I(C), I(D), II (except for the paragraphs captioned “Education Statements”), III, and IV of his co-defendants’ reply brief. (Dkt. #72)."

Although the SAC is lengthy, it is necessary to describe only those allegations that are relevant to allegations on which the lead plaintiff relies in its opposition to this motion to dismiss. The SAC’s factual allegations are accepted as true for purposes of deciding this motion, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in the lead plaintiff’s favor. Mobileye, founded in 1999, is a technology company and industry leader in advanced driver-assistance systems (“ADAS”). ADAS refers to automated safety features such as lane departure or obstacle warnings. The individual defendants, Amnon Shashua, Moran Shemesh Rojansky, Anat Heller, and Daniel Galves are current and former Company executives. Approximately 90% of Mobileye’s revenue derives from sales of its “EyeQ” silicon chips, which contain hardware and software to implement ADAS in automobiles. Mobileye sells EyeQ chips to “Tier 1” suppliers of automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) such as Ford. In 2022 and 2023, three of Mobileye’s Tier 1 customers generated roughly 70% of Mobileye’s revenue. The events at issue here occurred in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2022, Mobileye held an initial public offering (“IPO”). In June 2023, Mobileye held a secondary public offering (“SPO”) for Mobileye’s then-largest shareholder to resell a portion of its shares. The central claim in this lawsuit concerns annual contracts (“Contracts”) that Mobileye required some of its Tier 1 customers, including its three largest such customers, to enter in 2022 and again in 2023. The Contracts required those customers to buy a minimum number of Mobileye’s EyeQ chips. Mobileye used the Contracts to help protect itself from the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular to mitigate some of the supply chain risk. The SAC characterizes the Contracts as a “channel-stuffing scheme”. Through the Contracts, the SAC asserts, Mobileye “shipped millions of units (and recognized hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) above true market demand for the product.” That “untethering” of supply from demand allowed Mobileye to engage in the successful SPO. The SAC alleges that, once Mobileye’s customers were freed of the Contracts at the end of 2023, they drastically reduced their orders until they worked through the excess inventory that Mobileye had forced them to buy. The SAC asserts that when the defendants revealed the truth about the excess inventory and its impact on its projected sales, in two corrective disclosures in January and August 2024, the stock price plummeted. In the wake of the first disclosure, Mobileye’s stock price dropped from $39.72 to $29.97, and following the August 2024 disclosure, the stock price declined from $21 to $16.28. In opposing the motion to dismiss, the lead plaintiff has organized its allegations around four themes: (1) the impact of the minimum-commitment contracts; (2) historical sales data; (3) market share estimates; and (4) following the first corrective disclosure in January 2024, a misrepresentation regarding the source of customers’ excess inventory. To support its claims, the lead plaintiff relies on statements made by the Company in annual and quarterly SEC filings, during earnings calls, and at conferences held during the Class Period, which runs from January 26, 2023 to August 1, 2024. The statements on which the parties principally rely in connection with this motion are presented below in chronological order. Certain passages contain the alleged misrepresentations to which the SAC points; other passages contain the contextual material on which the defendants rely in bringing their motion to dismiss. I. 2022 Disclosure of 2022 Contracts and Excess Inventory In its October 18, 2022 IPO Registration Statement, the Company discussed the impact of the pandemic on the automobile industry, its suppliers, and its customers, including the excess inventory phenomenon. Among other things, it explained that in prior periods, certain Tier 1 customers increased their orders . . . to counteract the impact of supply chain shortages . . . and we expect these Tier 1 customers will utilize accrued inventory on hand before placing new orders . . . . As a result, some demand for our solutions and corresponding revenue from these customers were shifted to earlier time periods than otherwise would have occurred absent a general supply chain shortage and inflationary environment. (Emphasis supplied.) Mobileye disclosed as well that its “top three Tier 1 customers” had committed to purchasing “minimum quantities of certain solutions in 2022.”","The following facts are drawn from the SAC and documents incorporated into the SAC by reference.
