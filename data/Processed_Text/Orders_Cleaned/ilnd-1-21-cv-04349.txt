I. Background At this stage, the Court accepts all well-pleaded allegations as true. Hayes v. City of Chicago, 670 F.3d 810, 813 (7th Cir. 2012). Even when “faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a § 10(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss 3Citations to the record are “R.” followed by the docket entry number and, if needed, a page or paragraph number. 4In the amended complaint, the Plaintiffs group McKnight with Diab and Jordan and identify the three, together, as the ATI Individual Defendants. R. 58, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31–34. But McKnight is more properly grouped with the former FVAC directors, namely Joshua Pack, Marc Furstein, Leslee Cowen, Aaron Hood, Carmen Policy, Rakefet Russak-Aminoach, and Sunil Gulati. for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allega- tions in the complaint as true.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A. Pre-Merger To repeat, ATI provides physical-therapy services across the U.S. in 24 states. Am. Compl. ¶ 46. The company is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois, and was formed in 1996. Id. FVAC was incorporated in Delaware as a SPAC on June 10, 2020. Id. ¶ 47. A SPAC is a shell company formed for the purpose of raising money through a public offering to acquire or merge with an existing company. Id. ¶ 5. A key feature of a SPAC is that if it fails to acquire a company, then it must return its funds to investors. Id. ¶ 184. Relatedly, employees of a SPAC will generally lose their employ- ment at the end of the life of the entity. Id. ¶ 51. But FVAC did specifically allow its personnel to take employment with or become consultants for the new company cre- ated following a successful merger or acquisition. Id. ¶ 51. FVAC completed its initial public offering on August 14, 2020, raising $345 million. Id. ¶ 52. Meanwhile, ATI—in its pre-merger form—was undergoing important manage- ment changes. Around February 6, 2019, Diab became the new CEO of ATI, replacing McKnight, who at some point afterward became the CEO of FVAC. Am. Compl. ¶ 56. A couple of months later, in April, Cedric Coco was named ATI’s new Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). Id. ¶ 57. Two years after those appointments, ATI and FVAC announced, on February 22, 2021, a proposed merger to take ATI public as a combined entity. Id. ¶ 58. Right before, on February 21, Diab, Coco, and then-CFO Jordan entered into new employment agreements with ATI. Id. ¶ 61. These guaran- teed that, in the event of the termination of their employment, each executive would receive a multiple of their annual salary—1.5 times for Diab and 1.25 times for Coco and Jordan—as well as a pro-rated annual bonus, and the immediate vesting of any unvested equity. Id. B. Merger Naturally, the announcement of the proposed merger between FVAC and ATI led to public filings and disclosures, starting with the February 22, 2021 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 8-K announcing the proposed combination. Am. Compl. ¶ 123. The 8-K included ATI’s full-year 2021 financial projections: $731 million in revenues and $119 million in adjusted EBITDA. Id. ¶ 125. Separately, and on the same day as the merger announcement, Diab spoke at a presentation for in- vestors to discuss the merger. Id. ¶ 123. During that presentation, Diab stated that ATI was “certified as a Great Place to Work,” with “very high retention” and “low turnover” of its physical therapists. Id. The materials that followed the proposed-merger announcement were ATI’s annual SEC Form 10-K, Am. Compl. ¶ 127, and a series of proxy statements soliciting votes in favor of the merger from the owners or holders of FVAC stock. Id. ¶ 60. On March 12, 2021, FVAC filed its first proxy on SEC Form Schedule 14A. Id. 129. It stated that ATI had “a competitive compensation model,” “historically been able to realize high retention rates across [the] organization,” “favorable clinician retention rates and engagement scores,” and “[a]ttractive recruiting and retention capabilities … which allows the Company to recruit and retain talent.” Id. ¶¶ 91, 129. It also explained that ATI faced hypothetical risks from competition to recruit and retain physical therapists. Id. ¶ 131. And finally, it included 2021 financial projec- tions, namely the same revenue and adjusted EBITDA projections included in the February Form 8-K, as well as estimates valuing ATI’s goodwill at $1,330,085,000 and its tradename and other intangible assets at $644,339,000. Id. ¶¶ 133, 136. Af- terward came the proxy materials filed on April 1, which included statements that ATI had “high retention” and “strong retention” of employees, as well as a “superior ability to recruit and retain physical therapists” being “the Employer of Choice for P[hysical] T[herapy] Clinicians” with “[b]est-in-class infrastructure” for retaining physical therapists. Id. ¶¶ 90, 138, 139. The proxy also again contained the 2021 rev- enue and adjusted EBITDA projections previously presented on February 22 and March 12. Id. ¶ 141. Relatedly, the next two proxy statements (filed on May 5 and May 14) included the same statements about ATI’s competitive advantages from the March 12 proxy, as well as the same hypothetical risks about competition to recruit and retain physi- cal therapists, the same revenue and adjusted EBITDA projections, and the same estimates valuing ATI’s goodwill and its tradename and other intangible assets. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 143, 145, 147, 150, 152, 154, 156, 159. Those same 2021 revenue and EBITDA projections were also included, unchanged, in an additional set of proxy- statement materials filed on May 24, along with a statement that ATI had “[s]ignifi- cant labor savings through [a] more productive staffing model.” Id. ¶¶ 167, 169. ATI released its financial results for the first quarter of 2021 on May 20. Id. ¶ 161. Those results touted the opening of 14 new clinics and stated that the Company was “on track to achieve [its] de novo development targets for [2021].” Id. The quarterly re- sults were also incorporated into another proxy from FVAC, which included a state- ment that beginning in the first quarter of 2021, ATI visit volumes rebounded from COVID-related declines, and that “the Company continues to match its clinical staff- ing levels accordingly.” Id. ¶ 163. Following all those filings, the merger was finally completed on June 16–17, 2021, and stock from the new combined entity began trading publicly. Am. Compl. ¶ 62; R. 70-2, July Form 8-K at 5. Post-merger, ATI then submitted a Form S-1 registration statement to the SEC that repeated—one last time—the 2021 financial projections along with the valuations of goodwill, tradename, and other intangibles. Id. ¶ 171. C. Attrition None of the public filings that preceded the merger mentioned actual problems with attrition and retention of physical therapists. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 124, 128, 135, 140, 149, 158. But several former employees of ATI—confidential sources for the Plain- tiffs—observed attrition and retention problems in the time leading up to the merger. Id. ¶ 67–69, 70, 72–74, 77–88. For instance, Source 1, an ATI talent acquisition spe- cialist from May 2019 to September 2021, noticed that, by early 2020, recruits were rejecting ATI’s employment offers almost 50% of the time, mainly because of concerns over compensation. Id. ¶ 74. This rejection rate accompanied a physical-therapist attrition rate of around 40% in late-2020 and early 2021. Id. ¶ 79. For context, Source 3, an ATI revenue cycle analyst until April 2020, observed that before late-2020 the attrition rate “hovered just above 20%.” Id. ¶ 67–68. Source 1 knew about the elevated physical-therapist attrition rate because of weekly reports distributed to her and oth- ers. Id. ¶ 79. Source 1 also attended quarterly all-personnel meetings. Id. ¶ 100. At one in 2020, Source 1 told Diab and Jordan that certain markets, like Washington D.C., were “really bad for attrition” in part because it was “so difficult to attract and retain clinicians.” Id. At another, Source 1 heard Diab give a “spiel” about “the need to recruit and retain clinicians to support the Company’s growth.” Id. Source 2, another talent acquisition specialist, worked at ATI from October 2020 to August 2021 and oversaw the onboarding of physical therapists. Am. Compl. ¶ 81. This source also noticed an elevated attrition rate of 41% in late-2020 and also in 2021, driven by worse pay and hours compared to other companies. Id. ¶¶ 81–82. Source 2 heard Coco (the then-Chief Human Resources Officer) acknowledge reten- tion problems at an HR department lunch in either November or December 2020 or January or February 2021. Id. ¶ 81. Relatedly, Source 7, an ATI talent acquisition manager from June 2015 to August 2020, also heard Coco say that hiring was a “crit- ical priority.” Id. ¶ 84. Source 4, a senior financial analyst from October 2017 to December 2020, was another former employee who noticed increased attrition in 2020. Am. Compl. ¶ 86. Source 4 prepared monthly slide-decks for ATI’s executive leadership that included a monthly scorecard, including a chart with a trend line that detailed climbing attrition rates throughout the whole year of 2020. Id. ¶¶ 103–04. Similarly, Source 5, a former sales director from March 2016 to March 2021, observed the physical-therapist attri- tion rate reaching around 40% because employees were overworked. Id. ¶¶ 70, 77– 78. And finally, Source 6, a former ATI clinic director, had monthly calls at the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021 with the then-Chief Operating Officer Ray Wahl who said that ATI needed to “hold onto people because employees were leaving at an alarming rate,” which was “starting to impact the service that ATI was able to provide to patients.” Id. ¶ 83. D. Post-Merger Disclosures Despite the observations of former employees, problems with ATI’s physical- therapist attrition and retention did not publicly surface until after the completion of the SPAC merger (the merger happened in June 2021). On July 26, 2021, post-merger ATI reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Am. Compl. ¶ 111. Those results revealed that “the acceleration of attrition among therapists in the sec- ond quarter and continuing into the third quarter, combined with the intensifying competition for clinicians in the labor market, prevented [ATI] from being able to meet the demand we have and increased our labor costs.” Id. That led, in turn, to a reduction of the Company’s 2021 full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA projections: from $731 million to $640–670 million and from $119 million to $60–70 million re- spectively. Id. It also resulted in a lowered estimate for 2021 new-clinic openings: from 90 to 55–60. Id. And finally, the July 26 disclosure was accompanied by the resignation of Coco as CHRO. Id. at 112. ATI’s stock dropped by $4.52 per share from July 26 to 27. Id. ¶ 113. Around two weeks later, on August 9, 2021, the post-merger ATI board of di- rectors terminated Diab as CEO. Am. Compl. ¶ 116. The press release accompanying the termination stated that the Board determined that it was the right time for a leadership change. Id. No replacement, interim or full-time, was announced; rather, the board launched a search for a new CEO. Id. That was not the end of the bad news, however. On August 16, ATI announced that it was recognizing non-cash impairment charges for the period ended June 30, 2021, because the values of its trade name and single reporting unit were below their carrying value. Id. ¶ 117. Around two months later, on October 19, 2021, post-merger ATI announced selected preliminary third quarter results for 2021. Am. Compl. ¶ 118. The company further lowered its projected 2021 full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA: respec- tively, from $640–670 million to $620–630 million and $60–70 million to $40–44 mil- lion. Id. ATI also disclosed that it “implemented targeted measures that reduced clin- ical staff attrition” and “made progress toward restoring FTEs [full-time equivalents] with ATI hiring roughly 2 clinicians for every 1 departure in August and September 2021.” Id. ¶ 118. The adjustment of financial projections was due to “lower visit vol- ume” linked to the need “to invest[] in [ATI’s] field sales force” to “driv[e] visit growth.” Id. ¶ 15. On October 20, ATI’s stock price fell from $3.65 to $2.86 per share. Id. ¶ 119. E. Claims in this Lawsuit Given those allegations, the Plaintiffs bring the following claims. Count 1 as- serts securities fraud against ATI, Diab, Jordan, and McKnight under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and accompanying SEC Rule 10b–5. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 204–15.5 Count 2 is brought under Section 20(a) against Diab, Jordan, and McKnight as controlling persons for purposes of the alleged fraud. Id. ¶¶ 216–20. Count 3 alleges misstatements or omissions in proxy statements against all Defend- ants under Section 14(a) and accompanying SEC Rule 14a–9. Id. ¶¶ 231–44. Lastly, Count 4 is another under Section 20(a) claim, this time against Diab, Jordan, McKnight, and the FVAC board of directors as controlling persons for purposes of the proxy statements. Id. ¶¶ 245–56.
