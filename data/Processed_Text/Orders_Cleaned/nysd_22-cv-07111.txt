BACKGROUND I. Factual Allegations Because this case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court assumes that the complaints’ factual allegations are true and construes them in the light most favorable to the respective plaintiffs. See New Eng. Carpenters Guaranteed Annuity & Pension Funds v. DeCarlo, 80 F.4th 158, 168 (2d Cir. 2023). As previously noted, this case features two consolidated lawsuits. Consolidation “does not merge the suits into a single cause, or change the rights of the parties, or make those who are parties[] in one suit parties in another.” MacAlister v. Guterma, 263 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1958) (quoting Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 289 U.S. 479, 496-97 (1933)). Thus, the Court will not credit the Hoffman Complaint with allegations contained solely in the Amended Class-Action Complaint, and vice versa. Nevertheless, for the sake of telling this story only once, the Court will tell it in full, relying primarily on the longer and more detailed Amended Class-Action Complaint. A. Introduction to SPACs To appreciate the potential significance of the alleged events, one must understand several aspects of a particular type of corporate entity: the special-purpose-acquisition corporation (the “SPAC”). Ordinarily, a privately held corporation becomes a publicly traded corporation through an initial public offering (an “IPO”), a process entailing various legal requirements and associated expenses. See Thomas Lee Hazen, Law Sec. Reg. (“Hazen”) § 3:2 (Westlaw database updated Nov. 2023) (overview of the traditional registration process). SPACs offer another route for a private company to go public. “The creation of a SPAC begins with a sponsor forming a corporation and working with an underwriter to take the SPAC public in an IPO.” Michael Klausner, Michael Ohlrogge & Emily Ruan, A Sober Look at SPACs, Yale J. on Regul. 228, 236 (2022) (“Klausner et al.”). “Nominally, the SPAC is managed by its own officers and directors, who are selected by the sponsor. Those officers and directors typically overlap with the individuals who own and created the sponsor, and the compensation of the SPAC’s officers and directors typically aligns their interests with those of the sponsor.” Id. Following its IPO, a SPAC has “no business activities” except seeking “to acquire an existing [privately] operating company,” thus allowing the private company to become a public company without conducting an IPO. Class Compl. ¶ 40. “The capital from the SPAC’s initial public offering . . . is held in trust for a specific period of time to fund the acquisition.” Id. “SPACs usually have an 18-to-24-month period to find an acquisition target and completion of the SPAC business combination.” Hazen § 3:58. The resulting business combination “is often referred to as a de-SPAC transaction.” Id. “If a merger or acquisition is successfully made within the allocated time frame, founders and managers of the SPAC can profit through their ownership of the SPAC’s securities (typically about 20% of the SPAC’s stock, in addition to warrants to purchase additional shares).” Class Compl. ¶ 41. But “if an acquisition is not completed within that time frame, then the SPAC is dissolved and the money held in trust is returned to investors with no compensation paid to the founders and managers of the SPAC, whose SPAC securities expire worthless.” Id.; accord Klausner et al., supra, at 237 (“If the SPAC does not merge within the period provided for in the charter (or have its shareholders vote to extend its life by a few months), the SPAC must liquidate and distribute the funds in the trust to its public shareholders. In the event of a liquidation, the sponsor loses its investment.”). Plaintiffs contend that, as a result, “the founders and management team of a SPAC are highly incentivized to complete an acquisition within their deadline, even if the benefits of that transaction for the public shareholders of the SPAC are dubious.” Class Compl. ¶ 41. “Typically, common stockholders of a SPAC are granted voting rights to approve or reject the business combination proposed by the management team.” Id. ¶ 43. “Thus, when the management team identifies a target, a proxy statement must be distributed to all SPAC stockholders, which includes the target company’s financial statements and the terms of the proposed business combination.” Id. “Public stockholders in SPACs rely on management of the SPAC and the target company to honestly provide accurate information about any contemplated transactions.” Id. B. Formation of Trident and Early Efforts to De-SPAC Trident was a SPAC incorporated in Delaware on March 17, 2016. Id. ¶ 46. Trident filed its IPO prospectus (dated May 29, 2018) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 30, 2018. Id. ¶ 47; Trident Acquisitions Corp., Prospectus (Form 424B4) (May 29, 2018) (the “IPO Prospectus”), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673481/ 000161577418004472/s110477_424b4.htm [https://perma.cc/98JY-L5CK]; see 17 C.F.R. § 230.424(b)(4). In the IPO Prospectus, Trident stated that it “intend[ed] to focus [its] efforts on seeking a business combination with an oil and gas or other natural resources companies in Eastern Europe or interested in expanding into Eastern Europe.” Class Compl. ¶ 49 (brackets in original; emphasis omitted). The IPO Prospectus also reported that seven people served as officers and/or directors of Trident, including four of the Individual Defendants: Ponomarev (chief executive officer (“CEO”) and director), Komissarov (president, chief financial officer (“CFO”), and director), Gallagher (director), and Butkevych (director). Id. ¶ 50; IPO Prospectus at 69. The IPO Prospectus “repeatedly touted” Ponomarev and other officers as “experienced in the energy industries and working in Eastern Europe.” Class Compl. ¶ 50. On June 1, 2018, Trident completed the IPO of 17,500,000 units. Id. ¶ 47. Each unit “consist[ed] of one share of common stock and one warrant entitling its holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.” Id. Trident also granted the IPO’s underwriters an option to purchase up to 2,625,000 additional units to cover possible over- allotments; the underwriters exercised that option in full on June 4, 2018. Id. In total, Trident issued a total of 20,125,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of $201,250,000 from the IPO. Id. ¶ 48. Trident’s units began trading on the NASDAQ on May 30, 2018, and its common stock and warrants began separately trading on the NASDAQ on June 13, 2018. Id. ¶ 47. On June 5, 2018, Trident deposited the proceeds from the IPO – along with the proceeds from a private placement of an additional 1,150,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit – in a trust account for the purpose of funding a business combination. Id. ¶ 48 & n.5. Under its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Trident initially had until December 1, 2019, to complete a de-SPAC transaction. Id. ¶ 53. “If [Trident] was unable to consummate a business combination by then, [Trident] would be required to (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, and (iii) liquidate and dissolve the company.” Id. Trident could seek shareholder approval of an extension of the business-combination deadline. Id. ¶ 54. But “if such an extension was approved, [Trident] was required to provide shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares.” Id. That scenario risked shareholders “decid[ing] to redeem [Trident] shares in amounts that would significantly deplete [Trident’s] trust account and jeopardize its ability to complete a transaction even with an extended deadline.” Id. The failure to complete an IPO would render “worthless” the millions of shares and warrants acquired by Trident’s directors and officers. Id. ¶ 55. Trident “sought and obtained three extensions of the deadline, and each time, a portion of shareholders sought to redeem their shares.” Id. ¶ 56. As a result of those redemptions, Trident’s officers and directors “saw their financial interest in the company continue to dwindle,” and “the amount of funds [that Trident] had access to for an acquisition greatly declined, further shrinking the available pool of potential companies for which a potential acquisition by [Trident] would be enticing.” Id. ¶ 57. The last of these extensions pushed the business-combination deadline until December 1, 2020. Id. ¶ 56. Following the third extension and corresponding redemption of shares, Trident had just $62,286,780 left of the original amount of $201,250,000. Id. C. Trident’s Merger with Lottery On November 19, 2020, Trident announced that it had signed a letter of intent to combine with Lottery, a private company founded in 2015 and based in Austin, Texas. Id. ¶¶ 58-59. Lottery offered users an online platform to play lottery games, including state- sanctioned games such as Powerball and Mega Millions. Id. ¶ 59. Lottery also provided lottery-related data to digital publishers. Id. A press release dated November 19, 2020, filed with the SEC on a Form 8-K,2 described Lottery as “ha[ving] been a pioneer in the lottery industry, working closely with state regulators to advance the industry into the digital age.” Id. ¶ 74 (emphasis omitted); see ECF No. 117-3 (the “11/19/20 Form 8-K”). It also stated that Lottery “works closely with state regulators to advance the lottery industry, providing increased revenues and better regulatory capabilities, while capturing untapped market share, including millennial players.” Class Compl. ¶ 74 (emphasis omitted). Lottery “made the same or substantially similar statements regarding Lottery’s work with state regulators throughout the Class Period.” Id. ¶ 75 (listing press releases (the “State-Regulator Press Releases”) issued on February 8, February 22, March 22, April 5, April 12, April 21, April 27, and June 9, 2021; all were also filed with the SEC as Form 8-Ks); see, e.g., ECF No. 120-2 at 9; ECF No. 120-3 at 10. Lottery filed the final proxy statement and prospectus for the de-SPAC transaction with the SEC on October 18, 2021. Class Compl. ¶ 77; ECF No. 78 (“Ali Class Decl.”) ¶ 3; ECF No. 78-1 (the “Proxy”). In the Proxy – and, indeed, “[t]hroughout the Class Period” – Lottery “represented that it recognized revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (‘GAAP’) and that its financial and other public statements adequately A Form 8-K is a filing with the SEC announcing “material corporate events that should be known by the shareholders.” Wyche v. Advanced Drainage Sys., Inc., No. 15-cv-05955 (KPF), 2017 WL 971805, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2017), aff’d, 710 F. App’x 471 (2d Cir. 2017) (summary order). A Form 8-K/A is used to amend a previously filed Form 8-K. See Exchange Act Form 8-K, SEC (updated Dec. 14, 2023), https://www.sec.gov/divisions/ corpfin/guidance/8-kinterp.htm [https://perma.cc/8PSM-AL49]. A Form 10-Q is a quarterly report that “provides a continuing view of the company’s financial position during the year and generally includes unaudited financial statements.” Wyche, 2017 WL 971805, at *1 n.1. “A Form 10-K is an annual report that is intended to detail the financial condition and performance of a particular company for an annual period in a comprehensive manner.” Id. represented its financial condition.” Class Compl. ¶ 64; see, e.g., Proxy at 186 (“Our financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.”).3 The Proxy projected that Lottery would generate more than $70 million in revenue, more than $3 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), a 32 percent gross-profit margin, and a 5 percent EBITDA margin for the 2021 fiscal year. Class Compl. ¶ 80. Elsewhere in the document, however, the Proxy warned: As a private company, we have not been required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting nor has our management been required to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditors have not been required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls has resulted in and could result in material weaknesses which could lead to errors in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business. Proxy at 42. The Proxy also noted that “[i]n the course of preparing the financial statements that are included in this proxy statement/prospectus, [Lottery] ha[d] identified a material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.” Id. at 74. This material weakness “relate[d] to a deficiency in the design and operation of the financial statement close and reporting controls, including maintaining sufficient written policies and “The Accounting Standards Codification (‘ASC’) is the source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred to as ‘GAAP,’ published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’) to be applied by nongovernmental entities such as [Lottery].” DeCarlo, 80 F.4th at 172 n.9 (further quotation marks and citation omitted); see Class Compl. ¶ 136 & n.10. “The SEC treats the FASB’s standards as authoritative.” Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., 228 F.3d 154, 159 n.4 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Lucescu v. Zafirovski, No. 09-cv-04691 (DLC), 2018 WL 1773134, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2018); see also 17 C.F.R. § 210.4-01(a)(1) (“Financial statements filed with the Commission which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate, despite footnote or other disclosures, unless the Commission has otherwise provided.”). procedures and the need to use appropriate technical expertise when accounting for complex or non-routine transactions.” Id. The Proxy attributed the material weakness to the fact that, up to that point, Lottery was “a private company with limited resources” that “did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls, or the appropriate resources or level of experience and technical expertise, that would be required to oversee financial reporting processes or to address the accounting and financial reporting requirements.” Id. The Proxy assured investors that Lottery’s “management [wa]s in the process of developing a remediation plan.” Id. But it warned that “[t]he material weakness remains unremediated as of June 30, 2021,” and that it “could result in misstatements to [Lottery’s] financial statements that would be material and would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.” Id. The Proxy further stated that “[d]uring the course of documenting and testing [its] internal control procedures . . . , [Lottery] may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in [its] internal control over financial reporting.” Id. at 75. The Proxy noted that if Lottery “fail[s] to maintain the adequacy of [its] internal control over financial reporting,” it “may” suffer various negative consequences. Id. The Proxy also addressed the possibility that a jurisdiction could “enact, amend, or reinterpret laws and regulations governing [Lottery’s] operations” in ways that would impair its “existing operations or planned growth,” with potential ramifications for its “operations, cash flow, or financial condition.” Class Compl. ¶ 78 (emphasis omitted). The Proxy added that Lottery’s “business model and the conduct of our operations may have to vary in each U.S. jurisdiction where [it] do[es] business to address the unique features of applicable law to ensure [it] remain[s] in compliance with that jurisdiction’s laws. [Lottery’s] failure to adequately do so may have an adverse impact on [its] business, financial condition, and results of operations.” Id. (emphasis omitted). On October 21, 2021, Lottery issued a press release announcing its preliminary revenue results for the third quarter of 2021. Id. ¶ 83; ECF No. 120-4 (the “10/21/21 Press Release”). Per the 10/21/21 Press Release, Lottery’s third-quarter revenue was “expected to be between $22.0 million and $24.0 million.” Class Compl. ¶ 83. “The strong growth [compared to the previous quarter] was driven by increased sales in the Company’s [business- to-business] segment.” Id. The 10/21/21 Press Release also stated that, “[o]n a preliminary basis, revenue through the first nine months of 2021 is expected to be between $36.8 million and $38.8 million on a reported basis and $38.7 million and $40.7 million on a pro forma basis,” reflecting an increase of more than 270 percent compared to “the full twelve months of 2020.” Id. The 10/21/21 Press Release included a “notice regarding forward-looking statements” providing that “this release contains statements that constitute ‘forward-looking statements,’” and that “all statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included in this press release, regarding preliminary third quarter revenue results [and other topics] . . . are forward-looking statements.” 10/21/21 Press Release at 4 (capitalization omitted). The notice “caution[ed] . . . that the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are subject to [various] factors,” including Lottery’s “ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, including the remediation of identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relating to segregation of duties with respect to, and access controls to, its financial record keeping system, and [Lottery’s] accounting staffing levels.” Id. at 5. “Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this press release materialize,” the notice added, “actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.” Id. at 6. To ensure consummation of the merger, Trident’s board and shareholders approved measures extending the time to complete the deal until as late as December 1, 2021. Class Compl. ¶ 60 n.6. On October 29, 2021, Trident and Lottery announced that they had completed the merger, with the combined entity retaining Lottery’s name. Id. ¶ 61. Lottery’s common shares and warrants began trading on the NASDAQ on November 1, 2021. Id. DiMatteo was a co-founder of Lottery who served as an officer and director prior to the merger; after the merger, he was Lottery’s CEO and chairperson. Id. ¶ 27. Clemenson, another co-founder of Lottery, was the company’s chief commercial officer at the time of the merger; he retained that title until March 2022, at which time he became Lottery’s chief revenue officer. Id. ¶ 29. Dickinson was Lottery’s president and chief operating officer (“COO”) prior to the merger; after the merger, he served as Lottery’s president, treasurer, and acting CFO. Id. ¶ 28. Following the merger, Lever served as Lottery’s COO and chief legal officer. Id. ¶ 30. Komissarov was CEO and a director of Trident prior to the merger. Id. ¶ 34. He also served as Trident’s CFO until November 20, 2020. Id. D. Post-Merger Events 1. The 11/15/21 Form 8-K/A On November 15, 2021, Lottery filed financial statements as an exhibit to a Form 8- K/A submission. Id. ¶¶ 65, 89; see ECF No. 120-12 (the “11/15/21 Form 8-K/A”). In that filing, Lottery reported that for the three months ending on September 30, 2021, revenue increased from $1.6 million to $32.25 million – that is, by $30.65 million, or over 1,900 percent – compared to the same three-month period in 2020. Class Compl. ¶ 65; 11/15/21 Form 8-K/A at 13. Lottery stated that “[t]he increase in revenue was driven by a $30 million sale of affiliate marketing credits during the three months ended September 30, 2021.” 11/15/21 Form 8-K/A at 13; see also id. at 15 (attributing increase in revenue over nine-month period ending September 30, 2021, to “several factors including a $30 million sale of affiliate marketing credits during the three months ended September 30, 2021”). In other words, “nearly all of the revenue for the quarter was derived from [the sale of] marketing credits to an affiliate.” Class Compl. ¶ 65. Lottery “termed these credits ‘LotteryLink Credits.’” Id. ¶ 5 n.1. “LotteryLink Credits could be purchased by [Lottery’s] third-party marketers and redeemed as advertising credits to support flexible promotional packages (such as prepaid advertising, prepaid lottery games, among other things) via [Lottery’s] LotteryLink affiliate marketing program.” Id. Lottery made similar representations about revenue in a Form 8-K also filed on November 15, 2021. Id. ¶ 85 (“Third quarter 2021 revenue was $32.2 million, an increase of $30.6 million from the third quarter of 2020. The growth was driven by the global affiliate marketing program. . . . The Company expects to meet or exceed its previous guidance of $71 million for full year 2021 revenue.” (ellipsis in original)); see ECF No. 120-11 (the “11/15/21 Form 8-K”). 2. The Q3 2021 Report That same day, on November 15, 2021, Lottery filed its quarterly report for the third fiscal quarter of 2021 on a Form 10-Q. Class Compl. ¶ 87; Lottery.com Inc., Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) (Nov. 15, 2021) (the “Q3 2021 Report”), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/ data/1673481/000121390021059462/f10q0921_lotterycominc.htm [https://perma.cc/3B62- U36F]. The Q3 2021 Report “referenced the fact that [Lottery] had identified a material weakness relating to a technical accounting issue identified by the SEC in SPAC-related guidance.” Class Compl. ¶ 87. “Specifically, Lottery determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2021, and thus had restated its financial statements . . . , in order to comply with a new SEC Staff Statement regarding the classification of warrants.” Id. “Other than” that, the Q3 2021 Report continued, “there were no changes in [Lottery’s] internal control over financial reporting . . . during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, [Lottery’s] internal control over financial reporting.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Lottery also announced its “plan to enhance [its] processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to [its] financial statements.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Several exhibits were “filed as part of, or incorporated by reference into,” the Q3 2021 Report. Q3 2021 Report at 25. Among the exhibits were certifications by DiMatteo and Dickinson, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and its implementing regulations. Class Compl. ¶ 99; Q3 2021 Report, Ex. 31.1, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/ edgar/data/1673481/000121390021059462/f10q0921ex31-1_lotterycom.htm [https://perma.cc/DR9Z-FNBL] (DiMatteo’s SOX certification); Q3 2021 Report, Ex. 31.2, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673481/000121390021059462/f10q0921ex31- 2_lotterycom.htm [https://perma.cc/5E7H-5FED] (Dickinson’s SOX certification); see 15 U.S.C. § 7241; 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-14. DiMatteo and Dickinson both certified that they had reviewed the Q3 2021 Report and that, “[b]ased on [their] knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.” Class Compl. ¶ 99. They also certified that, “[b]ased on [their] knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report.” Id. DiMatteo and Dickinson further certified that they “ha[d] disclosed, based on [their] most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to [Lottery’s] auditors and the audit committee of [Lottery’s] board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions)”: (1) “[a]ll significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information”; and (2) “[a]ny fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.” Id. DiMatteo and Dickinson made “substantially similar certifications” in “[e]ach of Lottery’s financial statements issued during the Class Period after the [de-SPAC transaction].” Id. 3. The 3/31/22 Form 8-K and the 2021 Annual Report On March 31, 2022, Lottery “issued a press release, also filed as an attachment to a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on that date.” Id. ¶ 91; see ECF No. 120-13 (the “3/31/22 Form 8-K”). In the 3/31/22 Form 8-K, Lottery touted “strong” financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as for the full year of 2021. Class Compl. ¶ 91. Specifically, Lottery reported $21.5 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 (an increase of $18.2 million, or about 550 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020) and $62.6 million in cash for the fourth quarter of 2021 (an increase of $58.8 million, or over 1,500 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020). Id. Lottery also reported $68.5 million in revenue for 2021 (an increase of $61 million, or over 800 percent, compared to 2020). Id. On April 1, 2022, Lottery filed its annual report for 2021 on a Form 10-K. Id. ¶ 62; see ECF No. 78-2 (the “2021 Annual Report”). The 2021 Annual Report “reiterated the financial results released the prior day” in the 3/31/22 Form 8-K. Class Compl. ¶ 91. The 2021 Annual Report added that the $68.5 million in revenue was “driven by the sale of $47.1 million in LotteryLink Credits for prepaid advertising, prepaid lottery games, marketing materials and development services in the third and fourth quarters of 2021.” Id. ¶ 66. Lottery also reported that its accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021, was $21,696,653. Id.4 “Since the accounts receivable figure was lower than revenue for the same period (which itself was ‘driven’ by the sale of marketing credits), [Lottery] suggested that it had collected more than half the revenue from marketing credits from the customer.” Id. The 2021 Annual Report “also stated that it had identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of year-end 2021 and 2020, but it described this material weakness as one largely related to personnel and staffing – specifically, it related to ‘the design and operation of the procedures relating to the closing of financial statements.’” Id. ¶ 93. “Defendants reassured investors that [Lottery] had ‘commenced measures to remediate’ [this] material weakness” and that, “other than the deficiencies identified, ‘there was no change in [Lottery’s] internal control over financial reporting.’” Id. In the 2021 Annual Report, Lottery further stated that it “rel[ies] on technology services to closely monitor and track amendments, additions, and impositions of regulations in all jurisdictions regarding the authorization of lottery and work to maintain effective relationships with applicable legislative and regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which we operate or anticipate operating in.” Id. ¶ 62. Lottery added that it “use[s] this information . . . to create strong working relationships with the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which [it] do[es] business, to ensure transparent regulatory compliance and promote each jurisdiction’s objective for economic benefit through the sale of lottery games.” An “account receivable” is “[a]n account reflecting a balance owed by a debtor; a debt owed by a customer to an enterprise for goods or services.” Account, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019); accord Medi-Cen Corp. of Md. v. Birschbach, 720 A.2d 966, 969 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1998) (collecting similar definitions). Id. Lottery also stated: “While we believe that we are in compliance with all material domestic and international laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, we cannot ensure that our activities or the activities of those third parties with whom we do business will not become the subject of regulatory or law enforcement proceedings.” 2021 Annual Report at 43; see Class Compl. ¶ 62. 4. The 5/16/22 Form 8-K and the Q1 2022 Report On May 16, 2022, Lottery “issued a press release, filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.” Class Compl. ¶ 95; see ECF No. 120-14 (the “5/16/22 Form 8-K”). Lottery reported $21.2 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2022 (an increase of $15.7 million, or about 285 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2021) and $50.8 million in cash during the first quarter of 2022 (an increase of $32.5 million, or about 175 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2021). Class Compl. ¶ 95. Also on May 16, 2022, Lottery filed its quarterly report for the first quarter of 2022 on a Form 10-Q. Id. ¶¶ 67, 95; Lottery.com Inc., Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) (May 16, 2022) (the “Q1 2022 Report”), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673481/ 000121390022027217/f10q0322_lotterycom.htm [https://perma.cc/PT85-JQPD]. The Q1 2022 Report “reiterated the financial results disclosed in its press release.” Class Compl. ¶ 95. Lottery stated that “[t]he increase in revenue was driven by the sale of $18 million in LotteryLink Credits for prepaid promotional rewards, marketing materials and development services.” Q1 2022 Report at 10; see Class Compl. ¶ 67. An anonymous “Customer A” accounted for 87.7 percent of Lottery’s revenue and 99.6 percent of Lottery’s accounts receivable for the quarter. Class Compl. ¶ 70. The Q1 2022 Report further stated that Lottery had “evaluated the effectiveness of [its] disclosure controls and procedures.” Id. ¶ 97. Based on this evaluation, Lottery’s CEO and CFO – that is, DiMatteo and Dickinson – “ha[d] concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, [Lottery’s] disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting with respect to [its] financial statement close and reporting process.” Id. (emphasis omitted). But Lottery reassured investors that “[n]otwithstanding such material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting, [Lottery’s] management concluded that [its] condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, [its] financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.” Id. (emphasis omitted). 5.
