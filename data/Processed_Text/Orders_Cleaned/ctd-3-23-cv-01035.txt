BACKGROUND 1. Factual Allegations1 RTX is an American, multinational aerospace and defense corporation that was founded through a merger between United Technologies Corporation (“UTC”) and Raytheon Corporation (“RTN”). Pratt & Whitney (“Pratt”) is an industry-leading airplane industry manufacturer and former subsidiary of UTC, and is now a subsidiary of RTX. Am. Compl. at 11. Pratt’s The following facts are drawn from the Amended Complaint and statements or documents incorporated by reference. See Kleinman v. Elan Corp., PLC, 706 F.3d 145, 146 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002)). commercial engine sales are allegedly a critical driver of RTX’s success, and allegedly accounted for 30 percent of RTX’s net sales in 2022. Id. Pratt is allegedly an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and allegedly generates the majority of its profits through commercial aircraft engine sales and aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul (“Aftermarket MRO”) sales and services on its in-service engines. Id. Pratt’s most significant product is allegedly the Geared Turbofan engine family, which allegedly skyrocketed in popularity among commercial airlines after the product was launched in 2016. Id. ¶ 12. RTX initially sold the GTF engines at an alleged $1 million loss because of the engine’s expensive design and construction. Id. ¶ 13. The alleged plan was to breakeven and recoup the losses through Aftermarket MRO of the initial sales. Id. RTX could allegedly only charge for Aftermarket MRO sales and services, however, after the warranties expired on engines, which is typically up to five years from the time the aircraft enters flight service. Id. This business model allegedly gave Defendants a strong incentive to increase GTF production and get the engines into service as soon as possible, but those engines would need to be in service long enough for the warranties to expire in order for RTX to profit from Aftermarket MRO services. Id. ¶ 14. “However, following the GTF Engine’s commercial release in 2016, Pratt & Whitney struggled to increase capacity and thus began cutting corners in quality control for its GTF production.” Id. Pratt allegedly manufactured its engine parts using powdered metal. Id. This process allegedly involves creating a powdered metal alloy from raw materials, bonding the powder through compression and heat into a solid metal “forging,” and machining the metal forging to a part specification. Id. ¶ 20. Contamination is allegedly a significant risk when manufacturing parts from powered metal because contaminants allegedly cause the powdered metal to bond improperly. When such contaminated powdered metal is subject to extreme temperature and movement “that occur during typical flight conditions,” the contaminated metal can allegedly crack. Id. The crack can allegedly lead to “catastrophic fractures, engine fires and [allegedly] ultimately the loss of the airplane.” Id. In 2015, Pratt allegedly built a new multi-story structure at its powdered metal manufacturing facility in Clayville, New York, to allegedly increase its powdered metal manufacturing capacity as part of an alleged effort to scale-up production on the GTF engine. Id. ¶ 21. During the alleged scale-up process, there was some introduction of contaminants to Pratt’s powdered metal. Id. The company was allegedly aware of the powdered metal defect by 2020. Id. According to a former employee (“FE-1”), there was an alleged conference call in approximately August 2019 to discuss alleged powdered metal problems. Id. ¶ 22. Sarah Toomey, Chief Engineer, allegedly convened the call, a call allegedly led by “the Director of the GTF 1100 engine program, for the A321neo/A320neo aircraft.” Id. According to FE-1, there was allegedly concern about the facility in Clayville, New York. Id. Another former employee (“FE-5”) alleged that, in approximately 2020, “foreign objects were occasionally identified in powder as it was forming,” Id. ¶ 24, and FE-9 alleged that “colleagues from Pratt & Whitney’s metallurgical testing labs told him” that there had been issues with powdered metal since approximately 2016 “and that the Company was planning a recall because of this problem.” On March 18, 2020, Vietnam Airlines Flight VN-920 allegedly experienced an HPT disk fracture, allegedly leading its V2500 series Pratt & Whitney engine to rip apart, which allegedly forced the crew to abort a high-speed takeoff. Id. ¶ 26. The V2500 engine allegedly was manufactured using the same powdered metal process that GTF engine and at the same processing facility. Id. Pratt’s alleged analysis of the aircraft allegedly showed that the fractured disk was “attributable to ‘a material anomaly,’ or contamination resulting from ‘deficiencies in the manufacturing process.’” Id. By this point in 2020, Defendants allegedly “knew that the powdered metal defect was a systemic, serious problem afflicting all Pratt & Whitney engines equipped with parts constructed from the faulty, contaminated material,” and Defendants allegedly made this discovery in 2020, and were allegedly aware that “revealing the pervasive and costly powdered metal defect to investors would have a cataclysmic impact on RTX’s stock price.” Id. ¶ 27. Immediately after the alleged March 2020 incident, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) issued Emergency Airworthiness Directives and Airworthiness Directives allegedly requiring Pratt to remove all affected HPT disks in the V2500 engine family from service. Id. ¶ 28. These directives also allegedly required Pratt to investigate the “root cause” of the incident. Id. Based on that root cause analysis, Pratt later determined that the HPT disks “were defective due to contamination of the powdered metal from which they were made.” Id. Defendants later allegedly admitted that this defective powdered metal was used to manufacture HPT disks across Pratt engines from approximately the end of 2015 through the middle of 2021. Id. ¶ 29. Because HPT disks for both the V2500 and the GTF engine families were allegedly manufactured using the same process and using the same allegedly contaminated material, Defendants were allegedly aware that the same powdered metal defect present in the V2500 was also present in the GTF engine family. Id. Remedying a powdered metal defect would allegedly require RTX to take affected engines out of service for months prior to their warranty period, which would allegedly cost RTX “billions of dollars in emergency inspections and repairs, as well as compensation to airlines for prolonged grounding of planes” that suffered from the defect. Id. ¶ 30. Defendants are alleged to have committed numerous representations2 related to the scope of the powdered metal defect starting on February 8, 2021, when Defendants allegedly falsely assured investors that any early mechanical problems with the GTF engine had been addressed. Id. ¶ 6. Defendants allegedly were aware as early as March 2020 of the extent to which the powdered metal defect affected the in-service GTF engines, id. ¶¶ 3–4, and that the defect could cause critical engine parts to crack and fail during flight. Id. ¶ 34. Pratt allegedly provided the FAA with an “‘expanded’ non-public root cause analysis” of the Vietnam Airlines incident on July 29, 2021, that allegedly identified the same powdered metal defect within the GTF engine fleet that had allegedly caused the engine failure in Vietnam. Id. ¶ 37. The FAA allegedly released an Airworthiness Directive based on that “expanded” analysis on September 10, 2021, that related to three GTF engines. Id. On December 24, 2022, a Viva Aerobus flight equipped with a GTF engine allegedly caught fire and aborted takeoff in Mexico. Id. ¶ 39. Defendants continued to make statements about the GTF’s airworthiness and profitability. Id. ¶¶ 39–40. On July 25, 2023, Defendants issued an 8-K Press Release disclosing a “rare condition” in its powdered metal that would require Pratt to “to remove some [GTF] engines from service for inspection earlier than expected.” Id. ¶ 41. During the subsequent earnings call, Defendants disclosed that RTX would immediately recall approximately 200 GTF engines for “emergency ‘enhanced inspection,’ with approximately 1,000 more [allegedly] needing to be removed and inspected within the next 9 to 12 months, [allegedly] causing a $500 million hit to RTX’s free Specific alleged misstatements will be described in greater detail infra. cashflow.” Id. Defendants also allegedly revealed during the call that there were contaminates introduced into “powdered metal produced from approximately Q4 2015 into Q3 2021.” Id. Also, on July 25, 2023, RTX’s share price fell $9.91 per share, or 10.2%, to allegedly close at $87.10. Id. ¶ 42. On September 11, 2023, RTX issued a Press Release and Form 8-K providing an update on the powdered metal defect. Id. ¶ 45. Defendants allegedly admitted that the defect impacted the entire 3,00 engine fleet, and would require “600-700 engines to be removed for inspection in the near term.” Id. ¶ 46. Defendants allegedly informed investors that these inspections would require engines to be out of service for “as much as 250 to 300 days each . . . . The impact to RTX’s bottom line was now [allegedly] projected to be . . . $3 to $3.5 billion to repair the engines and compensate the Company’s airline customers for the lost use of their planes.” Id. On that same day, RTX’s share price fell an additional $6.58 per share, or 7.9 percent, to close at $76.90, more than 27 percent below the stock’s Class Period high. Id. ¶ 49. 2.
