I. BACKGROUND The Plaintiffs commenced this class action on July 30, 2021. (Dkt. No. 1.) The Consolidated Complaint (“Complaint”) was filed on January 7, 2022. (Dkt. No. 25.) Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed on March 8, 2022. (Dkt. No. 29.) Plaintiffs allege Concho Resources Inc., ConocoPhillips, as successor-in-interest to Concho, Timothy A. Leach, Jack F. Harper, C. William Giraud, E. Joseph Wright, and Brenda R. Schroer (the “Individual Defendants” and On April 7, 2022, this case was referred to the Undersigned for all purposes pursuant to U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72. (Dkt. No. 30.) together with Concho and ConocoPhillips, the “Defendants”) made misstatements and omissions which amount to securities fraud under §§ 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 implementing § 10(b) of the Act. (Dkt. Nos. 1, 25.) Plaintiffs categorize the allegations into four areas, including: declaring the transition to large-scale development as a success and touting its benefits despite having no basis to know it would work as intended;2 falsely stating that “manufacturing mode” was the product of gradual learning and verified techniques despite being experimental;3 issuing non-risk adjusted production forecasts despite internal understanding that such forecasts were inaccurate and overstated;4 and stating that large-scale development projects with higher risk exposure were balanced by projects with lower risk exposure, when in reality exposure was company-wide.5 (Dkt. No. 25 at 5.) The Court must decide whether the complaint states a claim against Defendants for violations of § 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5 and if it states a secondary § 20 control person claim against the Individual Defendants. Defendants challenge two elements of the § 10(b) claim: falsity and scienter, and also challenge the § 20 claim for lack of properly pleading a primary claim. (Dkt. No. 29.) Plaintiffs’ claims are based on personal knowledge; Concho’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); research reports by securities and financial analysts; transcripts of Concho’s conference calls with analysts and investors; Concho’s presentations, press releases, and reports; news and media reports concerning Concho, interviews with several former Concho employees; Concho stock price data; and other significant data.

No. 25 at ¶¶ 172, 177, 192, 195, 200, 210, 213, 226, 232, 246, 248, 297.) (See Dkt. No. 25 at ¶¶ 173, 175, 179, 183, 187, 192, 241, 254, 263, 267, 269, 272.) (See Dkt. No. 25 at ¶¶ 172, 181, 192, 198, 202, 226, 244, 261, 284.) / 49 A. Concho Before the Class Period Concho was a publicly traded oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and production of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin. (Id. at ¶ 30.) Defendant Leach was Concho’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors beginning in 2006. (Id. at ¶ 23.) Defendant Harper was appointed as Concho’s President in May 2017, and as Concho’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) in May 2016; he served as CFO until January 2019. (Id. at ¶ 24.) Harper oversaw Concho’s operations as well as the Company’s legal, accounting, information technology, and security functions. (Id.) Defendant Giraud was appointed as Concho’s Executive Vice President (“EVP”) in May 2017 and was named as the successor for Concho’s Chief Operating Officer (“COO”). (Id. at ¶ 25.) In January 2019, he was appointed as COO. (Id.) Defendant Wright preceded Giraud as Concho’s COO from November 2010 until January 2019. (Id. at ¶ 26.) Wright served as Concho’s Executive Vice President from November 2013 until January 2019. (Id.) Defendant Schroer was Concho’s Treasurer and Senior Vice President during the class period, Chief Accounting Officer until January 2019, and CFO beginning in January 2019. (Id. at ¶ 27.) Prior to the class period, Concho used established methods of vertical and horizontal drilling in the Permian Basin. (Id. at ¶ 35.) Even though industry predicted producers in the Permian Basin like Concho were at the “end of gains[,] efficiency[,] and improvement,” Concho believed it had found the next significant technological advancement to “maximize ultimate recovery, efficiencies and returns.” (Dkt. No. 29 at 1, 12; Dkt. No. 25 at ¶ 242.) Concho’s production was at an “inflection point” which the company claimed would allow for a technological transition to maintain its established efficiencies, returns, and risk management in its historically well-managed portfolio. (Dkt. No. 25 at ¶ 35, 242.) If the technological transition / 49 was successful, it would create a renaissance in the Permian Basin resembling the advent of hydraulic fracturing. (Dkt. No. 29 at 1.) The end of 2017 marked Concho’s transition to “large-scale development,” “manufacturing style development,” “manufacturing mode,” or “cube development.” (Dkt. No. 29 at 12.) Concho wanted to retain its position as “a leader in [] development . . . in the Permian” Basin and this was “one way that [Concho planned on] doing that.” (Dkt. No. 25 at ¶ 188.) Concho allocated “93% of [its] capital program [] to drilling and completion activities, with approximately 65% of that capital directed towards large-scale manufacturing projects.” (Id. at ¶ 171.) Defendants advised it “expect[ed] to grow total production at a compound annual growth rate of 20% from 2017 to 2020.” (Id. at ¶¶ 171, 185.) On December 31, 2017, Defendants estimated proved reserves increased 17% from year-end 2016, proved developed reserves increased 26% from year-end 2016, and that proved developed reserves represented about 70% of total proved reserves.6 (Id.) Proved Reserves are reserves that are estimated commercially recoverable with a 90% level of certainty and carry the lowest level of risk. (Id. at ¶ 41.) The market relies on a company’s Proved Reserves to establish the valuation of a Company because the ability to generate future revenue depends upon how much of its discovered resources can be reliably extracted. (Id.) Publicly traded oil and natural gas companies are required to include Proved Reserves information in a company’s financial reporting to assist investors and analysts in modeling future returns. (Id.) Proven Reserves are broken up into three categories: (a) “Proved Developed Producing” (PDP) reserves are those for which the well is completed, and the reserves are currently being produced; (b) “Proved Developed Non-Producing” (PDNP) reserves are those for which the well-bore exists, and the reserves are identified but are not currently producing; (c) “Proved Undeveloped” (PUD) reserves are those determined to be economically recoverable utilizing existing technology and assets, but where the well has not yet been completed. PUD represents the lowest risk adjustment for uncompleted oil and natural gas projects. (Id.) A reserve may also be categorized as Probable, Possible, or Contingent. (Id. at ¶¶ 42–43.) Probable reserves are those with a likelihood of commercial extraction of over 50% but under 90%, while Possible Reserves are those with odds of commercial extraction under 50%, but higher than 10%. (Id. at ¶ 42.) Contingent resources are those estimated to be potentially recoverable, but / Defendants 2017 annual report of SEC Form 10-K included a risk factor that warned, “[m]ulti- well pad drilling and project development may result in volatility in our operating results” and it is used “where practical.” (Id. at ¶ 180.) The 10-K also indicated the proved reserves in the Northern Delaware Basin were estimated at 35% of total proved reserves, and the Southern Delaware Basin was at 15% of total proved reserves. (Id. at ¶ 182.) B. Concho’s Representations During the Class Period In February 2018, Concho announced 7-well, 8-well, 10-well, and 13-well large-scale developments that showed “strong performance” and “outstanding results’” which would serve as an empirical point for moving forward with larger projects in the North and South Delaware Basin. (Dkt. No. 29 at 13; Dkt. No. 25 at ¶¶ 57, 170.) Defendant Leach assured investors that Concho’s prior efforts had “validated well spacing, lateral placement, and completion design” which allowed them to “give guidance [and] forecast the things that [they were] aware of at the time [they] give the guidance.” (Dkt. No. 25 at ¶ 58, 186.) Defendant Harper explained the Company “had successfully made the transition” because they “modeled the outcome as [they] see it based on the spacing that has either already happened or will happen in the future.” (Id. at ¶ 328.) In March 2018, Concho announced plans to speed up development of large-scale projects, despite simultaneously acknowledging the company “did not ‘have all the answers’” and the program was a “work in progress.” (Dkt. No. 29 at 13.) Harper equated the large-scale development with what industry commonly refers to as cube development and alluded to this being the method it would use to begin a 20 plus well project.7 (Dkt. No. 25 at ¶¶ 59, 329.) Concho which are not considered to be commercially recoverable with any reasonable degree of certainty due to any number of contingencies. (Id. at ¶ 43.) https://energyhq.com/2018/08/is-cube-development-the-future-of-shale-production/ (describing cube development as a technique that uses a three-dimensional, multi-layer approach that is costly, risky, complex, and multi-variable dependent). / 49 indicated the “well documented” benefit of the technique was the “drilling synergies” that “generates cost savings . . . [and] higher recoveries” and would be a “more effective way to complete [] wells.” (Id. at ¶¶ 59–60, 199, 329.) Despite an “increased percentage of capital going towards . . . larger-scale projects” Harper assured investors they should “expect more of the same” in the 2018 budget as was seen “in previous years.” (Id. at ¶ 197.) This was seemingly because, as he indicated, the large-scale projects were “dispersed amongst [Concho’s] asset base.” (Id. at ¶¶ 8, 201, 329.) Concho then announced it would acquire RSP Permian, Inc. for $9.5 billion in an all-stock transaction. (Id. at ¶¶ 203–05.) Leach indicated the purchase was expected to realize more than $60 million in annual corporate savings and over $2 billion in operational synergies. (Id. at ¶ 206.) The company also planned to move the newly acquisitioned assets into manufacturing mode to “generate cost savings and minimize[] parent-child locations.”8 (Id. at ¶ 207.) The $2 billion in operational synergies Harper described was going to be achieved by “preventing parent-child relationship[s through] larger-scale development [and] shared infrastructure.” (Id. at ¶ 209.) In May 2018, Concho announced six multi-zone “Key Projects” planned for 2018 and 2019, including a 6+ well project, an 8+ well project, three 10+ well projects, and a 23 well project. (Id. at ¶¶ 38, 220.) The 23 well project was called the “Dominator” and received regulatory approval the previous month, in April. (Id.) The project began early stages of development in April and completion in February 2019. (Id. at ¶ 38.) https://jpt.spe.org/what-is-really-happening-when-parent-and-child-wells-interact (describing a study on the interactions on parent and child wells in oil and gas production and explaining the parent-child relationship describes a subsurface challenge where wells negatively interact with one another, effecting each well’s production performance; the issue is traditionally addressed through proper well spacing to mitigate the negative effects of too tightly spaced wells). / Harper was already projecting that “large-scale project development [would] drive the quarterly production growth trajectory. Noting a great start to the year, [they] raised [the] full year 2018 production outlook” because “results [had] been very strong.” (Id. at ¶¶ 61, 332.) Giraud explained they could make this projection because it was not a “switch get[ting] flipped” or a big step change” from the company’s historical approach. (Id. at ¶ 62.) He explained the evolution the company went through, from first 2-well projects, to 3-well projects, to then 6 and 8-well projects, all leading to what the optimal development plan would be in simultaneously developing a square mile. (Id. at ¶ 224.) He acknowledged that in order to achieve this scale a company needs a very sizable balance sheet and technical team to withstand the challenges of the transition to the development mode technique. (Id. at ¶ 223.) Giraud assured investors the company went through a discovery, delineation, and development process to allow for an empirically based transition to the new technique. (Id.) This included knowing what the well “spacing need[ed] to be” because the company was further down the line and in a “later stage of innings” for data collection. (Id. at ¶ 69.) Leach explained that the positive first quarter operational and financial results were due to the company-wide focus on large-scale product development that enabled it to “maximize recoveries, efficiencies, and returns.” (Id. at ¶ 213.) In August 2018, Giraud explained the company coordinated over a year in advance to develop the plan for the Dominator project, and it was supported with data from a steady years long evolution of testing different spacing within a drilling zone and between drilling zones. (Id. at ¶¶ 66, 231, 335.) He touted the technique as unlocking significant value because it optimized well performance and increased resource recovery. (Id. at ¶ 234.) / In September 2018, Leach acknowledged the Dominator was an “extreme example of manufacturing mode” and Concho’s “most aggressive multi-well pad.” (Id. at ¶ 72.) He explained the transition’s purpose was to minimize parent-child interference and that the wells continued to get better and more cost-efficient. (Id. at ¶ 71, 239.) Leach assured investors that the company took a portfolio approach to mitigating risk and the scale of the program helped to manage the risk of the technique. (Id. at ¶¶ 71–72.) He further explained Concho’s ability to “balance risk” was “the most important thing that [Concho] do[es] that creates success for the company.” (Id. at ¶¶ 72, 242, 258.) In October 2018, Concho projected that production growth would increase by more than 25% from fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019, and the planned activity would drive two- year crude oil and total production compound annual growth rates of 30% and 25% respectively from 2018 to 2020. (Id. at ¶ 253.) Giraud again assured investors that the new technique would minimize the impact of parent-child effects because the company built “type curves” and other “internal modeling on the results they [had] already seen.” (Id. at ¶ 70.) He explained that the results were consistent with the company’s expectations, and as such, it was baked into the 2019 and 2020 production outlook. (Id.) Leach acknowledged that minimizing the effects would be different by zone and area, but despite its complexity, the company was developing a program to minimize interference. (Id.) In February 2019, Defendant Harper stated that Concho’s manufacturing mode development “continue[s] to demonstrate the prudence of this approach, which mitigates parent- child impacts, drives operational efficiencies and maximizes the long-term value of our investments.” (Id. at ¶¶ 71, 275.) / In March 2019, Harper told investors Concho has “historically been pretty conservative in the way [it] accounted for inventory and well spacing” and “that’s been [Concho’s] view up till now.” (Id. at ¶¶ 72, 283, 340.) In May 2019, Defendant Leach stated that he saw “strong early production out of our latest projects, including the Dominator,” later adding that “returns look pretty good for us” and that such projects “drive[] a lot of value creation.” (Id. at ¶¶ 67, 281, 292, 341.) C. Concho’s Representations After the Class Period On July 31, 2019, Concho released its financial results for the second quarter 2019 after the close of trading. (Id. at ¶¶ 298, 299.) Concho advised it reduced its active rig count, production targets were being reduced for the remainder of the year, but there would not be a parallel reduction in its capital budget. (Id.) Concho blamed the Dominator and it’s too-tight well spacing for the disparity between its financial projections and in its financial results. (Id.) But Concho would reveal the next day that the Dominator was not the only densely spaced project impacting its financial results. (Id. at ¶ 304.) Concho announced it would immediately change its trajectory to wider spaced wells in an attempt to reign in the expenditure of transitioning to manufacturing mode in order to stay on budget. (Id. at ¶ 303.) Concho stock price decreased by 22% from the July 31, 2019 closing price of $97.68 per share. (Id. at ¶ 305.) The stock traded at the highest volume, 17,881,152 shares, for the entirety of the Class Period by over 5 million shares. (Id.) The stock closed at $75.97 per share on August 1, 2019. (Id.) Analysts were at a consensus. Concho “blindsided the market with a sharp reduction in 2H19 oil volume guidance,” because of the “sharp contrast to what was contemplated in early 2019” and the resulting about face to wider well spacing. (Id. at ¶ 306.) In the following days, analysts decreased Concho’s stock price target repeatedly, indicated the decline placed the company at risk of being acquired, and challenged the / 49 company to “reconcile the updated oil guide from the previous oil guide and quantify how much of the lower oil output was driven by the spacing tests vs. lower activity and why capex remained the same.” (Id. at ¶ 306.) The outlook did not change in the following months. Leach indicated in 2020 and beyond fewer wells would be developed, all using wider spacing, but that even so, there would not be an increase in capital efficiency until 2020. (Id. at ¶¶ 309–10.) The company reduced its proved reserves by 16% primarily due to the “Company’s recent capital programs that included projects testing tighter well spacing.” (Id. at ¶¶ 31–43, 314–15.) Concho also released a more exacting risk warning related to tight well spacing. (Id. at ¶ 313.) On October 19, 2020, ConocoPhillips and Concho announced that they entered into an agreement to combine the two companies in a transaction valued at $9.7 billion, nearly the same price Concho had acquired RSP. (Id. at ¶ 317.)
