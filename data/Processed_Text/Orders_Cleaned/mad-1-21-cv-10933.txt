Factual Background Quinones alleges that the Defendants -- specifically Lucchino and Lebel acting in their capacity as Frequency executives -- made fourteen separate false, misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate statements throughout the class period between October 29, 2020, and March 22, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”), related to a clinical trial for the company’s key product that were purportedly deceiving to investors. Compl. ¶¶ 67-79. The crux of Quinones’ allegations relates to one of the criteria for admission to the clinical trial: the requirement that all study participants have some form of hearing loss. Id. ¶¶ 5, 13, 36, 47, 68, 69, 73, 75, 77, 79, 86. Specifically, Frequency conveyed to investors that “all subjects” in the clinical trial “have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Id. Quinones alleges that Lucchino and Lebel knew this was not the case. Id. ¶¶ 105-118. Quinones therefore claims that the challenged statements are false or misleading and, when combined with the strong inference of scienter created by, inter alia, Lucchino’s increase in stock [5] sales during the Class Period, thus constitute a violation of § 10(b) and § 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Id. ¶¶ 105-118. 1. The Parties Frequency is a publicly traded clinical-stage biotechnology start-up. Compl. ¶ 2; Defs.’ Mem. 2. Lucchino, co-founded Frequency in 2014. Defs.’ Mem. 2. Lucchino is the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Compl. ¶ 24. LeBel has been the company’s Chief Development Officer since 2018. Id. ¶ 25. The plaintiffs are a class of shareholders who purportedly purchased Frequency’s common stock at artificially inflated prices between October 29, 2020, and March 22, 2021, inclusive Id. ¶¶ 1, 22. Quinones claims they were harmed by the false, misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate statements made by Lucchino and Lebel throughout the Class Period. Id. These false or misleading statements ostensibly deceived Quinones into thinking that the FX-322 trial was proceeding according to plan -- despite the Defendant’s alleged knowledge to the contrary. Id. ¶¶ 22, 80-87. Quinones alleges that they would not have purchased or otherwise acquired Frequency’s stock if Defendants revealed that the study was methodologically flawed. Id. ¶ 110. [6] 2. FX-322 Clinical Trial Frequency was founded to develop a hearing loss treatment called FX-322, promoted as a potential treatment for patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss (“SNHL”). Id. ¶¶ 2, 28. Frequency announced promising safety and efficacy results after the first phase of the FX-322 clinical trial (Phase 1), but this study did not have enough patients fully to evaluate the effects of FX-322 on hearing loss. Id. ¶¶ 3, 31-32. Frequency announced the launch of a Phase 2a trial of FX-322 in October 2019 further to evaluate the efficacy of FX-322 as a treatment for SHNL. Id. ¶¶ 4, 35. The Phase 2a trial of FX-322 ran from September 2020 to December 2020, with study participants receiving weekly injections of either FX-322 or a placebo. Id. ¶ 8, 9. Trial participants were tracked weekly after the first injection. Id. ¶ 8. Ultimately, Phase 2a was “unlikely to deliver results that could support the efficacy of the FX-322”. Compl. ¶ 66. Frequency revealed the disappointing results of the study on the morning of March 23, 2021: The interim results [of Phase 2a] show that four weekly injections in subjects with mild to moderately sever [sic] [SNHL] did not demonstrate improvements in hearings measures versus placebo. . . . The Phase 2a interim results also showed an unexpected apparent level of hearing benefit in the placebo group that did not occur in previous trials and exceeded well- established published standards, potentially suggesting bias due to trial design. Given these [7] challenges observed in the Phase 2a study design, there was no discernible benefit of FX-322 over placebo. Compl. ¶ 80 (emphasis added). The market did not react well to these disappointing results and investors -- including Quinones -- took a beating: Frequency’s common stock plummeted from a share price of $36.29 at the close of trading on March 22, 2021, to $7.99 at the close of trading on March 23, 2021, a 78% drop that erased nearly a billion dollars from Frequency’s market capitalization. Id. ¶ 84. Stock analysts directly attributed this precipitous decline to the revelation that Phase 2a was potentially “bias[ed] due to trial design,” and one analyst noted that “management makes it sound like patients may have been faking worse hearing than they actually had to make sure they could enroll.” Id. ¶ 85. 3. Timeline of Statements by the Defendants Quinones alleges that fourteen separate statements made by Lucchino and Lebel throughout the Class Period were false, misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate in violation of 10(b). Compl. ¶¶ 67-79; see also Decl. Kevin M. McDonough Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 2, Appendix of Challenged Statements, ECF No. 36-2. Most important among these is Lucchino and Lebel’s repeated representation that the FX-322 Phase 2a trial was conducted on an unbiased and appropriate sample population -- specifically that all participants “[had] meaningful word [8] recognition deficits.” Compl. ¶¶ 5, 13, 36, 47, 68, 69, 73, 75, 77, 79, 86. Quinones alleges this was known to be untrue and that the statements by Lucchino and Lebel were thus false, misleading, incomplete, and/or inaccurate in violation of 10(b). Id. ¶¶ 66-79, 105-118. The following table summarizes the most relevant statements throughout the Class Period, each touched on in more detail below. Statement Date “[A]ll subjects [in Phase 2a] have 10/29/2020 meaningful word-recognition deficits.” Id. ¶ 68. “[A]ll subjects [in Phase 2a] have 01/11/2021 meaningful word recognition deficits.” Id. ¶ 76. Phase 2a’s “[e]ntrance criteria required all 01/11/2021 subjects have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Id. ¶ 76. “Every subject has to have a deficit. Now we 01/19/2021 have not disclosed what the deficit is to minimize any bias from patients but everyone has to fall within a certain range in order to qualify for the study. Id. ¶ 78 (emphasis removed). a. October 2020 The Class Period began on October 29, 2020, when Frequency issued a press release entitled “Frequency Therapeutics Announces Expanded FX-322 Clinical Development and Upcoming Day- Phase 2a Analysis” and posted a corporate slide presentation to the company website. Compl. ¶ 67. The press release stated, [9] inter alia, that all patients in Phase 2a had “mild to moderately severe acquired SNHL.” Id. The corporate slide presentation also stated that, in Phase 2a, “all subjects have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Id. ¶ 68 (emphasis added). Quinones alleges that this statement was materially false, misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate, because, as Lucchino and Lebel knew or recklessly disregarded, not all Phase 2a enrolled patients met the study’s inclusion criteria of having a meaningful word recognition deficit. Id. ¶ 69. b. January 2021 On January 11, 2021, after the Phase 2a clinical trial had ended, the Defendants once again stated unequivocally in a slide presentation -- posted to the company website and also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K -- that “[a]ll subjects [in Phase 2a] have meaningful word recognition deficits” and that Phase 2a’s “[e]ntrance criteria required all subjects have meaningful word recognition deficits.” Id. ¶ 76 (emphasis added). Lebel reiterated this requirement the next week at an investor presentation attended by Lucchino and others: [I]n the phase 1 safety study, there was not a requirement for anybody to fall within a range of word recognition. . . . In the phase 2A study, we’ve modified that. Every subject has to have a deficit. Now we have not disclosed what that deficit is to minimize any bias from the patients but everybody has [10] to fall within a certain range in order to qualify for the study. Id. ¶ 78 (emphasis added). Like the similar statements from October, Quinones alleges that these January statements were materially false, misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate, because, as Lucchino and Lebel knew or recklessly disregarded, not all Phase 2a enrolled patients met the study’s inclusion criteria. Id. ¶ 79. 4. Support for Statements Being Misleading a. Information From Confidential Witness Quinones’ confidential witness, CW1, was the Senior Manager of Clinical Operations at Frequency from January 2018 to September 2021. Id. ¶ 11. CW1 worked with Lebel and others at Frequency to develop the design of the FX-322 Phase 2a clinical trial, which according to Quinones, made them well-situated to have inside information regarding Phase 2a –- particularly regarding the sample population. Id. CW1 also oversaw the implementation of Phase 2a once the clinical trial began. Id. CW1 claims to have “confirmed that multiple patients enrolled in Phase 2a had qualified for and participated in the study despite not having met the inclusion criteria for the study” and that “such individuals simply ‘faked being deaf’ in order to enroll in Phase 2A.” Id. Additionally, CW1 “revealed that during the class period, [Lucchino and Lebel] were well aware that the [11] Phase 2a’s inclusion and exclusion criteria . . . were being disseminated online . . . .” Id. CW1 also claims that multiple “investigators” (i.e. the doctors who administered the Phase 2a clinical trial) came forward with concerns about a discrepancy regarding the patients’ ability to hear sounds at varying decibel levels. Id. ¶ 12. CW1 claims that several investigators contacted Lebel directly to express their concerns about these discrepancies. Id. b. Blog Posts In addition to guaranteeing that all participants in the FX-322 Phase 2a trial had meaningful hearing deficits, the Defendants repeatedly represented that the criteria for admission to the study were not publicly disclosed. Id. ¶¶ 67- 79. Quinones alleges these statements are undercut by a plethora of blog posts on numerous online message boards, which, inter alia, specifically reference the hearing deficit threshold (85% or less word score recognition) that was purportedly not publicly disclosed. Id. ¶ 51-55. For example, one forum, “Tinnitus Talk,”1 has an entire message board related to FX-322, Tinnitus is symptom of an underlying issue with the auditory system and commonly presents as a ringing in one or both ears but can also sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. See Compl. ¶ 49. [12] including the Phase 2a trial. Id. ¶ 51. As of July 2020, the FX-322 thread had over 9,000 posts and the thread is nearly 650 pages long. Id. Quinones alleges that those suffering from tinnitus believed FX-322 was a viable treatment option, based at least in part on comments made by Lebel,2 and that, as a result, those seeking treatment for tinnitus infiltrated the Phase 2a trial despite not actually having a meaningful hearing deficit. Id. ¶ 48. c. Lucchino’s Stock Sales Finally, Quinones claims that the rate of Lucchino’s stock sales increased throughout the Class Period and increased dramatically in December 2020 when phase 2A of the FX-322 study concluded. Compl. ¶¶ 13-14. During the Class Period, Lucchino sold an average of 57,000 shares per month, an average significantly higher than the average monthly stock sales prior In July 2020, LeBel was interviewed on a podcast called “Tinnitus Talk” (which is related to the online forum). Lebel was asked whether there were “any anecdotes or patient testimonials that kind of corroborate” that FX-322 “might have a profound effect on tinnitus.” He responded: “[W]e don’t have data. Certainly there is anecdotal reports as patients have come back and visited with ENTs when they have had conversations with them about how they are doing. Some of them have offered that they have had improvements in tinnitus, there’s nothing that we can quantitate there. Again, it adds to the excitement of the opportunity” of FX-322. See Compl. ¶ 50. [13] to the start of the Class Period of only 15,000 shares per month. Id.
